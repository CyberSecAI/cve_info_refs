### GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

```

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<<https://fsf.org/>>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

```
#### Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

#### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

**0.**
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

**1.**
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

**2.**
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

**a)**
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

**b)**
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

**c)**
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

**3.**
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

**a)**
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

**b)**
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

**c)**
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

**4.**
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

**5.**
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

**6.**
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

**7.**
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

**8.**
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

**9.**
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

**10.**
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

**NO WARRANTY**

**11.**
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

**12.**
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

#### END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

#### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

```

one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, see
<<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>>.

```

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

```

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

```

The hypothetical commands ``show w'` and ``show c'` should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than ``show w'` and
``show c'`; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

```

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

signature of Moe Ghoul, 1 April 1989
Moe Ghoul, President of Vice

```

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library. If this is what you want to do, use the
[GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html)
instead of this License.

The [Terms of Use for Wikimedia Foundation Projects](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3ATerms_of_Use "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Terms of Use") govern your use of [phabricator.wikimedia.org](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/ "phab:"). In addition:

1. **Code to Which You Hold the Copyright**: When you submit software source code, or other material intended for inclusion in software (such as documentation or translations), to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under the GNU General Public License (version 2.0 or any later version). The only exception is if the software to which you are contributing requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under that particular license. For example, at the publication of this version of the Phabricator Terms of Use, Visual Editor is licensed under the MIT license, so if you make contributions to Visual Editor through this site, you agree to license those contributions under the MIT license.
2. **Importing Code**: You may import source code that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the source code is available under terms that are [compatible with the GNU General Public License](//www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses) version 2.0 (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by that software).
3. **Etiquette**: You are expected to follow the [guidelines](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Bug_management/Phabricator_etiquette "mw:Special:MyLanguage/Bug management/Phabricator etiquette") to ensure that Phabricator is a productive and collaborative environment for managing bug reports and feature requests.

## Wikipedia volunteers work every day to curate the world’s knowledge. [Take a look back at what happened on Wikipedia in 2024](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia-year-in-review-2024/)

The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation provides the essential infrastructure for free knowledge. We host Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, created, edited, and verified by volunteers around the world, as well as many other vital community projects. All of which is made possible thanks to donations from individuals like you. We welcome anyone who shares our vision to join us in collecting and sharing knowledge that fully represents human diversity.

## Wikimedia projects belong to everyone

You made it. It is yours to use. For free. That [means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AReusing_Wikipedia_content) you can use it, adapt it, or share what you find on Wikimedia sites. Just [do not write your own bio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AConflict_of_interest), or copy/paste it into your homework.

2

## We respect your data and privacy

We do not sell your email address or any of your personal information to third parties. More information about our privacy practices are available at the [Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy), [donor privacy policy](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Donor_privacy_policy/en), and [data retention guidelines](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_retention_guidelines).

## People like you keep Wikipedia accurate

Readers [verify the facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVerifiability). Articles are collaboratively created and edited by a community of volunteers using [reliable sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVerifiability#What_counts_as_a_reliable_source), so no single person or company owns a Wikipedia article. The Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit, but [you and everyone you know can help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help%3AContents).

## Not all wikis are Wikimedia

The word “[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)” refers to a website built using collaborative editing software. Projects with no past or existing affiliation with Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation, such as Wikileaks and wikiHow, also use the term. Although these sites also use “wiki” in their name, they have nothing to do with Wikimedia.

Throughout history, knowledge has been controlled by a powerful few. [Wikipedia needs knowledge from all languages and cultures.](https://whoseknowledge.org/issues/public-online-knowledge/) The internet has become the default for accessing information—women, people of color, and the global south remain underrepresented. We invite you to help correct history.

Welcome!

This is the non-wiki privacy policy of the Wikimedia Foundation ("WMF"). This privacy policy applies to WMF's non-wiki sites, unless stated otherwise on a specific site. Some of our non-wiki sites may be hosted by third-party service providers. In these cases, we will provide a link to that service provider's privacy policy. The Wikimedia Foundation's main [Privacy policy](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy") a separate document, and applies to wiki-based sites.

This Non-wiki Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of non-wiki sites. By using these sites, you agree to be held to the terms of this Non-wiki Privacy Policy and the Wikimedia [Terms of Use](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3ATerms_of_Use "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Terms of Use"). If you do not wish to be held to the terms of this Non-wiki Privacy Policy and/or our terms of use, please do not use these sites.

For the sake of clarity, definitions in this Non-wiki Privacy Policy take on the same definitions found in the [main WMF Privacy Policy](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy"). The sites covered by this Non-wiki Privacy policy are separate websites, and are [not covered](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy#coverage "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy") by the general Wikimedia Privacy Policy. If a non-wiki site has an alternative privacy policy, it will link to that policy. If you have any questions or suggestions about this Non-wiki Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, please [Contact us](https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/contact/ "foundationsite:about/contact/").

Thank you!

## What Information We Collect and What We Do With It

### Personal data: Non-personally identifiable information

Like most website operators, WMF collects personal data in the form of non-personally-identifiable information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, including, but not limited to: the browser type, language preference, referring site, and date and time of each visitor request. We collect this personal data to understand how you interact with these non-wiki sites and related materials, maintain and improve these non-wiki sites and related materials, and protect against malicious users. From time to time, WMF may publicly release such personal data in aggregated or anonymized form, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of any of our sites.

### Personal data: Personally identifying information

Depending on how you choose to use this site, you may disclose different amounts of personal data that could be used to identify you (such as your IP address, user agent information, or general location). We will keep this information confidential, except as provided in this  Non-wiki Privacy Policy.

We use this information for our legitimate interests, including to understand how you interact with these non-wiki sites and related materials, maintain and improve these non-wiki sites and related materials, and protect against malicious users.

If you provide an email address, we may use it to contact you or send you surveys so that we can better understand how you use our services and how we can improve our services, or to update you about the Wikimedia Foundation, projects and activities. These surveys are always optional. Each message will contain information about how to opt-out of further emails.

### Cookies and other data collection tools

We may also use some common data storage technologies, including but not limited to: cookies, local storage, JavaScript, or tracking pixels, to obtain information that could identify you. We keep this information confidential, except as provided in this Non-wiki Privacy Policy. We use this information to make your experience with these non-wiki sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and user interaction with these non-wiki sites, and to generally improve our services. You may remove or disable some or all cookies and locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. While cookies and locally stored data may not be necessary to use these non-wiki sites, some features may not function properly if you disable cookies and/or local storage. If we ever use third-party cookies on these non-wiki sites, we will update our [Cookie Statement](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3ACookie_statement "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Cookie statement") to provide details of the cookie(s) in question. You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in the main WMF Privacy Policy's [frequently asked questions (FAQ)](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy/Frequently_asked_questions#cookieFAQ "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy/Frequently asked questions").

## When We Can Share Information

### With Your Permission

We may share your information for a particular purpose, if you agree, or as otherwise specified below.

### Third-Party Service Providers

As hard as we may try, we cannot do it all. We may share your information (including your email address and general location information) with people we work with (e.g., third-party service providers, contractors, community volunteers) in order to help maintain, better understand, or improve these non-wiki sites or other [Wikimedia Projects](https://www.wikimedia.org/) and sites. In the course of providing their services to us, some of these third-party providers and contractors may also collect and retain user information, including but not limited to user emails and general user location information based on IP addresses, in accordance with their privacy policies and any additional requirements we may put in place with them. As necessary, we may put safeguards, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers protect the confidentiality of your personal information.

### For Legal Reasons

We may access, preserve, or disclose your personal information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your personal information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only be able to provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to bodily harm that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.

Nothing in this Non-wiki Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

### Transfer of WMF

In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), information collected under this Non-wiki Privacy Policy may transferred to the new owner(s) of the Foundation or become subject to a different privacy policy such as the privacy policy of an acquirer.

### To Protect You, Ourselves, or Others

We may need to share your personal information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to: enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use or this Non-wiki Privacy Policy; investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions; prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person; protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public; or detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns.

### To Learn and Experiment

We may share non-personal or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites, including these non-wiki sites. Sharing this information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.

When we give access to personal information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your personal information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in the main WMF Privacy Policy's [frequently asked questions (FAQ)](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy/Frequently_asked_questions "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy/Frequently asked questions").)

In general, WMF does not disclose personal information obtained through these WMF non-wiki sites other than as described in this Non-wiki Privacy Policy.

## Information You Share with Third Party Services

These non-wiki sites may allow you to access third-party services through their interface. For example, if you click on a "Share" button, or a link contained in a blog post, you may be connected to an external website such as a Twitter post or a New York Times article. Please note that this Privacy Policy only governs information we collect, and you are responsible for reading and understanding privacy policies and practices of the third-party services that you use.

## How Do We Protect Your Data?

We strive to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your personal information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

### Accessing Your Information

WMF works hard to accurately process and maintain information. If you would like to access, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete the personal information we have about you, object to our processing of such personal information or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), or if you would like to change your WMF communication preferences, you (or an authorized representative) can let us know by contacting us at privacy![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/15px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org. While we will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request, there are certain situations where we will not grant your request (such as when we cannot adequately verify your identity to give you access to personal information, when we are legally required to retain information, or when we are not technologically able to change or delete information). Therefore, the granting of such requests remains at the sole discretion of WMF.

### How Long Do We Keep Your Data?

Once we receive personal information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible interval that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of these non-wiki sites and our obligations under applicable U.S. law. For more information on Wikimedia's data retention policies, please see our [Data Retention Guidelines](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Legal%3AData_retention_guidelines "Special:MyLanguage/Legal:Data retention guidelines").

## Transfer of Information to the United States

If you decide to access or use these non-wiki sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, processing, disclosure, and other uses of your information in the U.S. as described in this Non-wiki Privacy Policy. You also consent to the transfer of your information by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.

## Our Response to Do Not Track

We are strongly committed to protecting users' nonpublic information. Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the "When We Can Share Information" section of this Privacy Policy.

Because we protect all users in accordance with this Non-wiki Privacy Policy, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's "do not track" signal. For more information regarding Do Not Track signals and how we handle them, please visit the main WMF Privacy Policy's [frequently asked questions (FAQ)](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy/Frequently_asked_questions#DNTFAQ "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy/Frequently asked questions").

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, we reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will provide notice of changes to this Privacy Policy in a reasonable time and manner.

We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of these non-wiki sites after any subsequent version of this Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of that version of the Privacy Policy on your part.

## Contact us

If you have questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, or the information collected under this Privacy Policy, please email us at privacy![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/15px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org or [contact us](https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/contact/ "foundationsite:about/contact/") directly.

Depending on your jurisdiction, you also may have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority competent for your country or region.

## Thank You!

Thank you for reading our Non-wiki Privacy Policy. We hope you enjoy using the Wikimedia sites, and appreciate your participation in creating, maintaining, and constantly working to improve the largest repository of free knowledge in the world.

**This policy was approved by Eileen Hershenov on July 24, 2018, pursuant to the [Delegation of policy-making authority](/wiki/Resolution%3ADelegation_of_policy-making_authority "Resolution:Delegation of policy-making authority") by the Board, and went into effect on July 30, 2018.**

# Description

Users can specify a URL format in an external identifier property using a formatter URL with a string like "[https://viaf.org/viaf/$1"](https://viaf.org/viaf/%241%22) and then use the external identifier property in an item to substitute a string into the URL. However there seems to be no protocol validation, meaning users can use a string like "javascript:alert() //$1" to execute javascript when the URL is clicked.

We get a lot of folks who play around/test things out on live wikis. Given [the author's history](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special%3ACentralAuth/GZWDer), I doubt this was at all intentionally malicious, though it might not be a terrible idea to delete/os that wikidata item just to be safe, in that it actively points any would-be attacker in the correct direction here.

Also, specifically adding a few WMDE folks here for additional attention.

I made myself oversighter (let me know if I should !log that, I wasn’t sure) and deleted the property. I hope that doesn’t generate a notification to the user, though even if it does, they hopefully won’t remember what the property was (given that it was created in February 2020; I didn’t put any details in the log message).

Looks like the only currently used protocols (on Wikidata) are https (4650 times), http (1829), tel (2), and httsp (1, clearly a typo). We allow some more protocols in URL values (e.g. email; UrlSchemeValidators::getValidator() has a fairly long list), but it looks like those aren’t used in formatter URLs at the moment, so let’s limit those to https, http and tel for now. (And by “limit”, I mean that we just don’t use the formatter URL if it uses another property, though we won’t block anyone from saving it.)

TODO: Also look into formatter URI for RDF resource.

I haven’t yet been able to reproduce this issue locally – I think formatter URLs have some weird caching.

As far as I can tell, the ExternalIdentifierRdfBuilder has the same problem, i.e. we might emit javascript: “URIs” in our RDF output. (I’ve been able to reproduce this locally, too – note that the property must have the datatype external-id.) I’m not sure if that’s considered a security issue? I don’t think we make these URIs clickable anywhere on wikidata.org; on query.wikidata.org, users can build arbitrary URIs anyways ([example](https://query.wikidata.org/#SELECT%20%28%3Cjavascript%3Aalert%28%27hi%27%29%3E%20AS%20%3Furl%29%20%7B%7D)).

I have been able to reproduce it locally now and the patch seems to fix it. (It looks like turning the property into an external-id one was required – I thought we also supported formatter URLs on the string type, but I might’ve been wrong. Try running php extensions/Wikibase/repo/maintenance/changePropertyDataType.php --new-data-type external-id --property-id P\_\_\_, or just make sure your test property ID for this task has datatype external identifier to begin with.)

The user in question is [@Bugreporter](/p/Bugreporter/) on Phabricator, by the way, if anyone wants to check if they created any security tasks which this might be a duplicate of. (I’m not in [acl\*security](/tag/acl_security/), so I can’t check myself.)

Thanks, I've updated T276237 and [T292236](/T292236).

Subbing them to see if they remember (I view this action as very low-risk in the context of this bug).
