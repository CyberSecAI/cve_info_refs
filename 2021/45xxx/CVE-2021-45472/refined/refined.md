  "CVE-2021-45472": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in MediaWiki's Wikibase extension. It arises from the lack of proper sanitization in formatter URLs when external identifier properties are used. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a formatter URL, which gets executed when the URL is clicked. This is because the system does not validate the protocol of the formatter URL, allowing for 'javascript:' URLs.",

      "root_cause": "Lack of protocol validation for formatter URLs in Wikibase extension.",
      "weaknesses": [
