The content is related to CVE-2021-45787.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when adding videos, specifically in the "name" and "remarks" fields, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly encode or sanitize user input before storing it in the database and displaying it to other users.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit the affected website. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or the execution of further malicious actions against users. The vulnerability is present in the admin panel but affects users on the front end after exploitation.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker would need to access the admin panel of the application and add a video containing malicious JavaScript code in the name and/or remarks fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to add videos through the admin interface.
