Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-45845:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the usage of `os.system()` to execute the `asciidoctor` command in the `PathSanity.py` script. The script incorporates unsanitized text from the input file into the command, which leads to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **OS Command Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-provided input when constructing the command for `os.system()`. This allows an attacker to insert arbitrary commands into the string that is passed to the shell for execution.
- **Use of `os.system()`:** The use of `os.system()` itself is a weakness because it executes the command through a shell. This introduces multiple ways to inject commands, for example by using shell metacharacters such as `$()` for command substitution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running FreeCAD.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Input File:** The attack vector is a crafted FreeCAD document file (`.FCStd`) that contains a malicious string in the "Output File" field of a Path Job object. When this file is opened and the Path Sanity check is run, the malicious string is incorporated into the command to be executed by the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create or modify `.FCStd` files:** An attacker needs the capability to craft or modify a FreeCAD document to include a malicious payload in the "Output File" field of a Path Job object.
- **Victim must open the file and run the Path Sanity Check:**  The victim must open the crafted file in FreeCAD, navigate to the Path workbench, and then specifically trigger the "Sanity check" action on the malicious Path Job object.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was present in FreeCAD version 0.20 and potentially earlier versions.
- The exploit sequence could be unreliable.
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `os.system()` with `subprocess.Popen()` (or later `subprocess.run()`), which allows separation of command and parameters, thus preventing command injection.
- The fix was implemented in commit `f18c73049123dc6a5f6bd0d096744d7795bfe1c0` and later improved.
- The issue is tracked in the FreeCAD bug tracker as issue #4810.
- Debian issued a security advisory (DSA 5229-1) to address this vulnerability.
- The fix is available in FreeCAD version 0.19.1+dfsg1-2+deb11u1 for the Debian bullseye distribution.
