The provided content is related to a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, which is not directly specified by the CVE description. However, since the document provides vulnerability details, the following information can be extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability exists in the web interface of the affected NETGEAR Orbi products.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system, which could lead to complete system compromise (high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact).

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A) meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface of the affected device (PR:H). User interaction is not required (UI:N).

**Affected Products:**
* RBK752, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBR750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBS750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
