The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, which is relevant to CVE-2021-45556.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The advisory states that there is a "post-authentication command injection security vulnerability" present in several NETGEAR Smart Managed Pro Switches.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:** The advisory indicates a CVSS score of 8.4 and the CVSS vector provides the following:
- Confidentiality: Low (C:L)
- Integrity: High (I:H)
- Availability: High (A:H)
This suggests a successful attack could lead to a compromise of integrity and availability, along with limited confidentiality breach.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is described as "Adjacent" (AV:A).  This suggests an attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to the device (post-authentication).
- The attacker must have network access to the device.
- The advisory indicates that the attack complexity is High (AC:H) and requires High privileges (PR:H).
