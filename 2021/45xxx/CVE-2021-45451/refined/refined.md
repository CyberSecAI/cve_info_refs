{
  "CVE-2021-45451": {
    "root_cause": "In `psa_aead_generate_nonce()`, the function reads back from the output buffer, which could be in memory shared with an untrusted application.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Policy bypass",
      "Decryption oracle vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A potential policy bypass or decryption oracle vulnerability if the output buffer is in memory that is shared with an untrusted application. This could allow an attacker to potentially decrypt data or bypass security policies.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered if a malicious actor has access to memory shared with an application using the vulnerable function `psa_aead_generate_nonce()`.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to a shared memory region with an application that is using the vulnerable function `psa_aead_generate_nonce()` in Mbed TLS. This could be achieved via a compromised process or some form of shared memory scenario."
