## HTCONDOR-2022-0001

## [CVE-2021-45103](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45103)

---

**Summary:**

For jobs that request HTCondor to transfer files to or from S3 cloud
storage, pre-signed URLs that can be used to access private files are
written to daemon logs and the job ad.

| Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Schedd, Shadow, Starter daemons | 8.9.4 and above | All platforms | Not known to be publicly exploited | 9.0.10, 9.6.0 |
| Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences |
| Verified | Login or READ access to Schedd | Submit or Execute host | Low | Medium |
| Fixed Date | Credit |
| 2022-03-15 | Brian Bockelman |

**Access Required:** Login or READ access to Schedd

An attacker able to login to a Schedd or Startd machine can obtain
pre-signed URLs for all jobs that passed through that machine.
An attacker with READ access to the SchedD can obtain pre-signed URLs
for any jobs for which S3 transfers failed.

**Effort Required:** Low

An attacker can obtain pre-signed URLs for all jobs by searching the
daemon logs of the condor\_shadow or condor\_starter.
They can obtain pre-signed URLs for jobs with an S3 transfer error
using the command line tools.
These URLs can be trivially used to access the associated files in S3.

**Impact/Consequences Required:** Medium

The attacker can access the S3 file associated with each pre-signed
URL. This can include both reading and writing of the data.

**Workaround:**

Upgrading all HTCondor daemons to version 9.0.10 or 9.6.0 fully
addresses this vulnerability.

If upgrading is not possible, you can work around this issue by disabling the generation of
pre-signed URLs by HTCondor. To do so, set the following in your
configuration files:
```
SIGN_S3_URLS = False
```

For jobs that use file transfer to/from S3 for private data, you must
then devise another access path. This can include providing a file transfer
plugin that supports the 's3' or 'gs' scheme.

**Full Details:**

Embargoed until future notice.
