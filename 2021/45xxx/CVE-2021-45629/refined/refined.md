This document describes a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR WiFi systems.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Pre-authentication command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability present in the affected NETGEAR devices, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device.
- The vulnerability exists prior to authentication, meaning no user credentials are required for exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows for arbitrary command execution on the affected devices. This could lead to:
    - Full compromise of the device.
    - Data exfiltration.
    - Denial-of-service.
    - Installation of malware.

**Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted remotely over the network, likely via crafted network requests that exploit the vulnerable command injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only requires network connectivity to the affected device. No authentication or special user privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Devices and Firmware:**
- CBR750, running firmware versions prior to 4.6.3.6
- RBK752, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
- RBR750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
- RBS750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
- RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
- RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
- RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
