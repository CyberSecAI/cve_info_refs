Package        : zsh
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-45444

It was discovered that zsh, a powerful shell and scripting language,
did not prevent recursive prompt expansion. This would allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary commands into a user's shell, for
instance by tricking a vcs_info user into checking out a git branch
with a specially crafted name.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.7.1-1+deb10u1.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.8-6+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.

For the detailed security status of zsh please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zsh>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2926-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : zsh
Version        : 5.3.1-4+deb9u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-45444

It was discovered that zsh, a powerful shell and scripting language,
did not prevent recursive prompt expansion. This would allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary commands into a user's shell, for
instance by tricking a vcs_info user into checking out a git branch
with a specially crafted name.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
5.3.1-4+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.

For the detailed security status of zsh please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zsh>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
