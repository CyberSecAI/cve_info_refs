Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-45692.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `messagepack-rs` crate's deserialization functions pass an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided `Read` instance.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `deserialize_binary`, `deserialize_string`, `deserialize_extension_others`, and `deserialize_string_primitive` functions pass an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided `Read` instance. This violates the assumption that the data being read is initialized.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  A safe `Read` implementation might read from this uninitialized buffer, leading to undefined behavior. The exact impact is dependent on the specifics of the `Read` implementation and the system/environment where this code is running. It could range from incorrect data to crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could provide a crafted messagepack data stream that would trigger one of the vulnerable deserialization functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply the input to a `messagepack-rs` deserialization function that is using the vulnerable `Read` trait implementation. The attacker would need the ability to control the input to the deserialization functions.
