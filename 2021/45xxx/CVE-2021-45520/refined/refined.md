The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a hardcoded password vulnerability. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a hardcoded password present in the firmware of certain NETGEAR Orbi products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded password in the firmware, which could allow unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The advisory states that the CVSS score is 9.6, indicating a critical vulnerability.
- The CVSS vector implies that exploitation could lead to high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Specifically, a successful attack could result in unauthorized access, potentially leading to control over the affected device and the network it serves.

**Attack vectors:**
- The CVSS vector (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) indicates the following:
    - Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent (A) - The attacker must be within the same network segment.
    - Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L) - The attack requires little or no specialized access conditions.
    - Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - No user privileges are required.
    - User Interaction (UI): None (N) - No user interaction is required.
    - Scope (S): Changed (C) - A vulnerability in one component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.
    - Confidentiality (C): High (H) - There is a high impact to confidentiality.
    - Integrity (I): High (H) - There is a high impact to integrity.
    - Availability (A): High (H) - There is a high impact to availability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network segment (adjacent).
- No special privileges or user interaction is required.
- The attacker can exploit the hardcoded password to gain unauthorized access.

**Affected products:**
- RBK352, RBR350, and RBS350 models running firmware versions prior to 4.4.0.10

**Mitigation:**
- NETGEAR recommends updating to the latest firmware (version 4.4.0.10 or later).
