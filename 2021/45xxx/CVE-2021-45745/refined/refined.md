The provided content relates to CVE-2021-45745.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization in the "About" plugin of Bludit 3.13.1. The application stores unsanitized user-provided input into the database, which is then executed as JavaScript when the "About" plugin data is displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization on the About plugin settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Data theft

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the Bludit admin panel can navigate to the "About" plugin settings and inject malicious JavaScript code into the "About" field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to have administrative access to the Bludit application.
- The attacker needs the ability to navigate to the plugin settings page and modify the about field.
