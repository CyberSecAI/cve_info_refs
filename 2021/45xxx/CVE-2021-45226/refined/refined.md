Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45226:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation of the HTTP "Host" header.
*   **Weakness:** The application uses the user-controlled "Host" header to generate password reset links, without validating it.
*  **Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts the password reset request and modifies the "Host" header to an arbitrary domain.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The application sends password reset emails with links pointing to a domain controlled by the attacker (phishing).
    *   Victims might be tricked into entering their credentials on the attacker's website, leading to account compromise.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests. This could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack or by controlling the user's browser (e.g., through XSS).
