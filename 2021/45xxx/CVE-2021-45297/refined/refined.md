Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-45297:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to an infinite loop in the `gf_get_bit_size` function within the GPAC multimedia framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `gf_get_bit_size` function enters an infinite loop when processing a crafted input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The infinite loop consumes CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted file to the GPAC tool (MP4Box), an attacker can trigger the infinite loop. The specific command used is `./bin/gcc/MP4Box -hint POC`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious file to GPAC to process it with the `-hint` option.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported on December 10, 2021 and was fixed on December 14, 2021. The fix was included in commit `fb13af3`.
- The provided GDB information shows the program is stuck inside the `gf_get_bit_size` function, confirming the infinite loop.
- The provided stack trace also indicates that the infinite loop is occurring during the `gf_rtp_builder_init` initialization which is triggered by the `hint` operation.
- A sample file `POC.zip` was provided to reproduce the issue.

This issue is clearly related to CVE-2021-45297, as it describes an infinite loop vulnerability in GPAC which can lead to denial of service.
