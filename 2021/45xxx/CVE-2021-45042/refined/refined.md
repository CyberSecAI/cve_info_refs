Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-45042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the KV secrets engine in HashiCorp Vault does not properly check the size of keys before persisting them to the Raft log when using Integrated Storage. Specifically, keys larger than 32KB can cause the Raft storage cluster to fail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of input validation on key sizes within the KV secrets engine.
- Integrated Storage's underlying Raft implementation is susceptible to failures when handling excessively large keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An authenticated user with write permissions to the KV secrets engine can cause the Vault cluster to crash by writing a key larger than 32KB. The cluster will continue to panic after restarts, leading to a persistent denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated user with write access to the KV secrets engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permissions to write to the KV secrets engine.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects Vault and Vault Enterprise versions 1.4.0 through 1.7.6, 1.8.5, and 1.9.0.
- It was fixed in versions 1.7.7, 1.8.6, and 1.9.1.
- The fix involves correctly checking key sizes for the KV secrets engine before writing to the Raft log.
- This vulnerability was reported by an external party through a GitHub issue.
- The Gentoo security advisory also references this CVE as one of the multiple vulnerabilities fixed in the update.
