Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-45732:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Netgear Nighthawk R6700 router uses hardcoded credentials to encrypt/obfuscate configuration backups.
*   The router does not prevent users from manipulating these configuration backups, despite their encryption/obfuscation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The use of hardcoded credentials for the encryption/obfuscation of backup files.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Lack of proper mechanisms to prevent users from manipulating the configuration backups, despite the intended encryption.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** The ability to reconfigure settings not intended to be changed via backup manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can extract configuration backups using publicly available tools.
*   The attacker can then manipulate the extracted configuration, repackage it, and restore it to the router.
*   This can lead to changing settings not intended to be modified, potentially including those that could compromise the device or network.
*   This could result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack requires the attacker to have access to the router's configuration backup.
*   The attacker needs to use publicly available tools to extract and modify the configuration backup.
*   The attack involves restoring the manipulated backup to the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs access to the router or its configuration backup.
*   The attacker needs to have the technical skills to use the tools to extract, modify, and repackage the backup file.
*   The attacker needs to have a low-privileged account on the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Netgear Nighthawk R6700 version 1.0.4.120.
*   The Tenable advisory TRA-2021-57 covers this and other vulnerabilities in the same product.
*   The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 8.8 (High), with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   The provided CVSS score in the Tenable advisory (7.1/6.7 with vector AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) appears to be an aggregate score covering all vulnerabilities discussed.
