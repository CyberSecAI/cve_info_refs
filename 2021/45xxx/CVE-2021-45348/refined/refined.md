Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**1. SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `makeSafe` function in `admin/incFunctions.php`, intended to sanitize user inputs, is flawed and can be bypassed using specific crafted strings.
*   **Weakness:** Inadequate input sanitization in the `makeSafe` function. The function attempts to detect and prevent SQL injection by checking for escaped characters but fails for specific inputs like  `\'\'or 1=1; -- `.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This could compromise the entire application database.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a malicious string like `\'\'or 1=1; -- `  as input to any parameter that is processed by the flawed `makeSafe` function.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to input data that reaches the vulnerable `makeSafe` function.

**2. Arbitrary File Deletion Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `pageUploadCSV.php` script's `delete_csv` function, combined with insufficient input validation in the `get_csv` function allows for arbitrary file deletion
*  **Weakness:** The `get_csv` function does not properly validate the `csv` parameter and uses the `basename()` function incorrectly. It checks if a file exists but fails to ensure the file is located within the intended directory before calling `unlink()`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially disrupting the application's functionality or causing data loss.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted request to `admin/pageUploadCSV.php?action=delect_csv&csv=`, where the `csv` parameter contains the path to a file on the server that they want to delete.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the server, specifying the file to be deleted.

The content provides more details than a standard CVE description, including specific vulnerable code snippets and examples of exploit strings. It also highlights the flawed logic of the sanitization function and the file deletion process.
