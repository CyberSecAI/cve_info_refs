- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the `maetd_cpy_slice` function within the `libSPenBase` library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in `libSPenBase` library function `maetd_cpy_slice`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through processing of data within the `maetd_cpy_slice` function of the `libSPenBase` library. Specific attack details are not provided.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide input to trigger the vulnerable function. The attacker requires the ability to execute code/actions that would cause `maetd_cpy_slice` to be executed with a specially crafted input.
