Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-25081:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WP Google Map plugin lacked CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in its AJAX actions. This allowed attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of logged-in administrators.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The plugin's AJAX actions, particularly those for removing posts and updating plugin settings, did not include checks to verify the origin of the requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Post Deletion: Attackers could force logged-in administrators to delete posts without their consent.
- Plugin's Settings Update: Attackers could modify the plugin's settings (e.g., API key, language, regional area), potentially disrupting functionality or injecting malicious configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through crafted HTTP requests sent to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious web page or clicking a malicious link.
- No specific user role besides administrator access is required, as the vulnerability affects actions available to administrators.
- Attacker can be external to the application

**Additional Details:**
- The provided code diffs show the addition of nonce verification for the vulnerable AJAX actions in the plugin's JavaScript and PHP files. This change in version 1.8.4 addresses the CSRF vulnerabilities.
- The `wpgmapembed_remove_wpgmap`, `wpgmapembed_save_setup_wizard` actions are specifically highlighted in the provided proof of concept as being vulnerable.
- The code diffs also reveal the introduction of a 'c_s_nonce' parameter in AJAX calls.
