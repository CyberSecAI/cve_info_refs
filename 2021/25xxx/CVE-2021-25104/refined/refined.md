- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not escape generated links, which are then used when the OceanWP theme is active.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to phishing sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL with malicious JavaScript code in the `step` parameter (e.g. `https://example.com/wp-admin/?step=demo&page=owp_setup&a"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`), an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when a user accesses the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it.
