Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `sgpb_type` parameter in the URL is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in a `require` statement. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. By manipulating the `sgpb_type` parameter, an attacker can include local files from the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The LFI vulnerability can be escalated to RCE by using wrappers like `phar://`. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a malicious archive (e.g., a zip file containing PHP code).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request, where the `sgpb_type` parameter is manipulated in the URL.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker needs to upload a malicious archive (e.g., ZIP file with PHP code) to the server, which can be done through the WordPress media upload functionality, or a plugin or form that allows file uploads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileged Account:** The attacker needs a low-privileged account (e.g., author or above) on the WordPress site to upload the malicious archive. In some cases, if the blog allows subscriber uploads, even lower privileges may suffice.
*   **Access to the WordPress Site:** The attacker requires access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `wpInit` function within the `Actions.php` file. The code directly uses the `$_GET['sgpb_type']` parameter in a `require` statement without proper validation.
*   The fix implemented in version 4.0.7 includes a check against a list of allowed types. If the provided `sgpb_type` is not in the list, the code redirects to the home page, preventing the LFI.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided changelog shows a fix for the `sgpb_type` parameter issue, as well as a bug related to exporting subscribers.
*   The vulnerable parameter `sgpb_type` is also mentioned in the modified `Actions.php` file, where it is now sanitized and validated against an array of allowed popup types before being used.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.9 (Critical), which indicates the severity of the issue.

This detailed breakdown should be helpful in understanding the nature and implications of the CVE-2021-25082 vulnerability.
