- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `passthru.php` file in the plugin does not validate the `src` parameter before redirecting the user to it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Open Redirect.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary website, potentially leading to phishing attacks or the distribution of malware.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with an attacker-controlled `src` parameter, and enticing a user to visit the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges. The attacker only needs to craft a malicious URL containing the `src` parameter and distribute it to potential victims.
