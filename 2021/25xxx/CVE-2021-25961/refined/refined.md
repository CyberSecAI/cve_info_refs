The provided content relates to CVE-2021-25961.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the SuiteCRM application's failure to properly invalidate password reset links associated with deleted user IDs.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- Improper invalidation of password reset links: When a user is deleted, the associated password reset links remain active.
- Account takeover: This allows an attacker to take over a newly created user account with the same user ID as the deleted user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a newly created user's account.
- Complete account takeover: By resetting the password using the old link, the attacker gains full control of the new user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Password reset link generation:** The attacker initiates a password reset request for a target user.
2.  **User deletion:** An administrator deletes the target user.
3.  **User re-creation:** An administrator creates a new user with the same user ID.
4. **Password reset:** The attacker uses the previously obtained password reset link to set a new password for the re-created user, gaining unauthorized access to the account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  **Low privileged user access:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate a password reset request and save the generated link.
- **Knowledge of a user to be targeted** The attacker needs to target a specific username to perform the password reset.
- **Administrator action**: The attacker needs an administrator to delete and recreate an account.
- **SMTP Settings**: SMTP settings need to be configured to send password reset emails.

**Affected Versions:**
- SuiteCRM versions 7.1.7 through 7.10.31
- SuiteCRM versions 7.11-beta through 7.11.20

**Mitigation:**
Upgrade to SuiteCRM versions 7.10.32, 7.11.21, or higher.
