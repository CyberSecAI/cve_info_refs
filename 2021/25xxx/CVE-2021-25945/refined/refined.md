The provided content relates to CVE-2021-25945.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `extend()` function in the `js-extend` npm module does not validate the type of object before assigning a value to a property, allowing for prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype pollution: The function `extend()` doesn't check if the assigned property is part of the object's own properties.
- Improperly controlled modification of object prototype attributes.
- Improperly controlled modification of dynamically determined object attributes

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: An attacker can create a non-existent property or manipulate existing properties, potentially crashing the application.
- Remote code execution: The vulnerability could potentially be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network by supplying a malicious JSON payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious value via a JSON payload that gets parsed and used in the vulnerable extend function.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**
- The `extend()` function accepts an `obj` argument.
- An attacker can provide a malicious JSON payload that includes the `__proto__` property.
- Because of missing validation, the properties within the attacker's payload are directly assigned to the target object, allowing for prototype pollution.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can pollute the object prototype by assigning a value to the `polluted` property via `__proto__`.

**Affected Environments:**
- js-extend versions 0.0.1 through 1.0.1

**Remediation:**
- There is no fix available. Mitigation strategies are suggested like:
  - Freezing an object to prevent the addition, removal, or modification of its properties.
  - Validating JSON inputs with schema validation to ensure only predefined attributes are used.
  - Creating objects without prototype associations using Object.create().
