Subject: ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-25214,
 CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)

On April 28, 2021, we (Internet Systems Consortium) disclosed three
vulnerabilities affecting our BIND 9 software:

    CVE-2021-25214: A broken inbound incremental zone update (IXFR)
    can cause named to terminate unexpectedly
    <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2021-25214>

    CVE-2021-25215: An assertion check can fail while answering queries for
    DNAME records that require the DNAME to be processed to resolve itself
    <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2021-25215>

    CVE-2021-25216: A second vulnerability in BIND's GSSAPI security policy
    negotiation can be targeted by a buffer overflow attack
    <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2021-25216>

New versions of BIND are available from <https://www.isc.org/downloads>

Operators and package maintainers who prefer to apply patches selectively can
find individual vulnerability-specific patches in the "patches" subdirectory
of the release directories for our two stable release branches (9.11 and 9.16)

   <https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.11.31/patches>
   <https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.16.15/patches>

With the public announcement of these vulnerabilities, the embargo
period is ended and any updated software packages that have been
prepared may be released.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-1971

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those
name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which
compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function
behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer
dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses
the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names
between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certiﬁcate 2) When
verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via
the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control
both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can
trick a client or server into checking a malicious certiﬁcate against a malicious CRL then this may occur.
Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certiﬁcate.
This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certiﬁcate and CRL being veriﬁed. OpenSSL’s
s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the “-crl_download” option which implements
automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note
that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct
encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that
OpenSSL’s parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are
affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug
in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls
node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as ﬁrst argument. If the DoWrite
method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult
structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other
exploits.

Request Smuggling’)

Vulnerability CVE-2020-8625

BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are conﬁgured to use GSS-
TSIG features. In a conﬁguration which uses BIND’s default settings the vulnerable code path is
not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-
gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconﬁguration options. Although the default conﬁguration is not
vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well
as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.
The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named
process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND
9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3449

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message
from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where
it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a
NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3450

The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT ﬂag enables additional security checks of the certiﬁcates present
in a certiﬁcate chain.
It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to
disallow certiﬁcates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added
as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a
previous check to conﬁrm that certiﬁcates in the chain are valid CA certiﬁcates was overwritten. This
effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certiﬁcates must not be able to issue other certiﬁcates. If a
“purpose” has been conﬁgured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certiﬁcate is
a valid CA. All of the named “purpose” values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore,
where a purpose is set the certiﬁcate chain will still be rejected even when the strict ﬂag has been
used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certiﬁcate veriﬁcation routines, but it can
be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly
set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT veriﬁcation ﬂag and either not set a purpose for the certiﬁcate
veriﬁcation or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL
versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3711

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The ﬁrst time, on en-
try, the “out” parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the “outlen” parameter is populated with the buffer
size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufﬁciently sized
buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the “out”
parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of
the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the ﬁrst call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can
be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overﬂow when
EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A
malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause
attacker chosen data to overﬂow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of
other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application
to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3712

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which
contains a buffer holding the string data and a ﬁeld holding the buffer length. This contrasts with
normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL
(0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL’s own “d2i”
functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the
ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING
structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures
which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the “data” and “length” ﬁelds in the
ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous
OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING
byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been
directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where
that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application
without NUL terminating the “data” ﬁeld, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can
also occur during name constraints processing of certiﬁcates (for example if a certiﬁcate has been
directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and
the certiﬁcate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures).
It can also occur in the
X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor
can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of
the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing
a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such
as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).

proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent
the server TLS certiﬁcate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note
that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certiﬁcate that curl will accept for the MITMed

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22901

curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in already freed memory
being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server can use
this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When
libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it
stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If
the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed
HTTP/2 connection) that ﬁrst transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on
that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using
that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote
code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct
place in memory.

The vulnerability affects all currently maintained BIND 9 branches (9.11, 9.11-S, 9.16, 9.16-S, 9.17) as
well as all other versions of BIND 9.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-25216

In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1
-> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of
the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected
version and are conﬁgured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a conﬁguration which uses BIND’s default
settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly
setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential conﬁguration options. Although
the default conﬁguration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND
is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with
Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO
implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND
was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can be used to trigger a buffer
over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can
be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overﬂow and possibly also to achieve remote code
execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and
Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC
implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users,
we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it
had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable
ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO
implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-25219

In BIND 9.3.0 -> 9.11.35, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.21, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.35-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32803

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary
File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufﬁcient symlink protection. node-tar aims to guarantee
that any ﬁle whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part,
achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent
unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when
directories are created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a
directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the
directory being created and added to the node-tar directory cache. When a directory is present in the
directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where
node-tar checks for symlinks occur. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially
allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary
ﬁles into that location, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in
releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32804

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File
Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufﬁcient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent
extraction of absolute ﬁle paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the preservePaths
ﬂag is not set to true. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute ﬁle paths
contained in a tar ﬁle. For example /home/user/.bashrc would turn into home/user/.bashrc. This
logic was insufﬁcient when ﬁle paths contained repeated path roots such as ////home/user/.bashrc.
node-tar would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute ﬁle path with
repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. ///home/user/.bashrc) would still resolve to an absolute
path, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2,
4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a
custom onentry method which sanitizes the entry.path or a filter method which removes entries
with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which
ﬁxes a similar bug in later versions of tar.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37701

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive
entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both
\ and / characters as path separators, however \ is a valid ﬁlename character on posix systems.
By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to
bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink
into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary ﬁles into that location, thus allowing
arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive
ﬁlesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at FOO, followed by a symbolic link named foo, then
on case-insensitive ﬁle systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from
the ﬁlesystem, but not from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.
A subsequent ﬁle entry within the FOO directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic
link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases
4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches
for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version
of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37712

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on
Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same ﬁle system entities as their 8.3 “short
path” counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the
path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same ﬁle system entity,
followed by a ﬁle using the ﬁrst form. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the ﬁlesystem, it
was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted
tar ﬁle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary ﬁles into that location,
thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18,

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37713

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part,
accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that
contain .. path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This
logic was insufﬁcient on Windows systems when extracting tar ﬁles that contained a path that was not
an absolute path, but speciﬁed a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as C:some\path.
If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example D:\extraction\dir, then the result
of path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath) would resolve against the current working
directory on the C: drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a .. portion of the
path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as C:../foo, and was not properly sanitized
by the logic that checked for .. within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects
users of node-tar on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and
6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.
If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.
There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization
procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions
of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39134

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency con-
tracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected
folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency speciﬁers deﬁned in package.json man-
ifests for dependencies with a speciﬁc name, and nesting folders to resolve conﬂicting dependencies.
When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist’s internal data structure saw
them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the node_modules hierarchy. How-
ever, on case-insensitive ﬁle systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined
with a symlink dependency such as file:/some/path, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in
which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the ﬁlesystem. For example, a package
pwn-a could deﬁne a dependency in their package.json ﬁle such as "foo": "file:/some/path". An-
other package, pwn-b could deﬁne a dependency such as FOO: "file:foo.tgz". On case-insensitive
ﬁle systems, if pwn-a was installed, and then pwn-b was installed afterwards, the contents of foo.tgz
would be written to /some/path, and any existing contents of /some/path would be removed. Anyone
using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive ﬁlesystem is potentially affected. This is patched in
@npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39135

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency
contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the
expected folder. This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project’s node_modules
folder. If the node_modules folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced
with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on
the ﬁle system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are ﬁltered out, so
another means of creating a node_modules symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A preinstall
script could replace node_modules with a symlink. (This is prevented by using --ignore-scripts.)
2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run npm install
--ignore-scripts in the root. This may be successful, because npm install --ignore-scripts is
typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe.
This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more
information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.

A patch for CVE-2021-25216 appears to be missing.  In some supported
branches of Alpine, we erroneously followed a development branch of BIND,
so I am trying to determine if there is anything I need to backport to
cover CVE-2021-25216.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide on this.

Ariadne

Subject: Re: ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities
 (CVE-2021-25214, CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)

Hi Ariande,

BIND 9.17.x was using the system SPNEGO since 9.17.2 (I think).

Also for older versions, it should be enough to use --disable-isc-spnego if you can’t patch it (that’s what I am doing for Debian buster).  It just won’t work with Heimdal krb5, but it compiles just fine with MIT krb5.

Cheers,
Ondrej

Yeah, we've always built with --disable-isc-spnego, so no problem there.

I wound up just upgrading every branch still supportd to 9.16.15.  Seemed
like the easiest way.

# Advisory Details

June 7th, 2021
## ISC BIND TKEY Query Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-657ZDI-CAN-13347

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-25216](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25216) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.1, [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | ISC |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | BIND |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of ISC BIND. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of TKEY queries. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the "bind" user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | ISC has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

Package        : bind9
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-25214 CVE-2021-25215 CVE-2021-25216
Debian Bug     : 987741 987742 987743

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server
implementation.

CVE-2021-25214

    Greg Kuechle discovered that a malformed incoming IXFR transfer
    could trigger an assertion failure in named, resulting in denial
    of service.

CVE-2021-25215

    Siva Kakarla discovered that named could crash when a DNAME record
    placed in the ANSWER section during DNAME chasing turned out to be
    the final answer to a client query.

CVE-2021-25216

    It was discovered that the SPNEGO implementation used by BIND is
    prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This update switches to
    use the SPNEGO implementation from the Kerberos libraries.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
