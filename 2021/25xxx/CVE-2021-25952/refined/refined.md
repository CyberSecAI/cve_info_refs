{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `set()` function in the `just-safe-set` npm module does not validate the type of object before assigning a value to a property. Specifically, it doesn't check if the property being set is a prototype property (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution vulnerability",
       "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')",
       "Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service or potentially achieve remote code execution by creating non-existent properties or manipulating existing ones on the object prototype, which can affect all objects inheriting from the prototype.",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the `props` argument of the `set()` function to include `__proto__` or other prototype properties, the attacker can modify the prototype of the object.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to control the `props` argument passed to the vulnerable `set()` function."
