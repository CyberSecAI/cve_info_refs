Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-25346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the Quram ImageCodec component of the Samsung Galaxy S20's libimagecodec library. This insufficient validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The core issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: A successful exploit can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- Potential for further exploitation: The advisory suggests that this vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, could allow for arbitrary code execution within the current process context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector requires user interaction. Specifically, the user must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious content (webpage or file) that will trigger the out-of-bounds read within the vulnerable component when processed by the user.
- The attacker relies on user interaction (victim visits page/opens file) for exploitation.
