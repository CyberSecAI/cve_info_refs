- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a specific settings value before outputting it on the Debug page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with administrative privileges (Admin+). They insert a malicious payload into the "Try to increase the memory limit to" settings of the plugin. The XSS is triggered when another admin user accesses the debug function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative access to the WordPress site to modify plugin settings. The attacker also needs to be able to access the WordPress debug page after having modified the plugin settings.
