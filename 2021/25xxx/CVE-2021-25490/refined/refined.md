Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-25490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a "keyblob downgrade attack" within the Keymaster Trusted Application (TA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Downgrade Attack:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to downgrade the keyblob, which is a data structure used to store cryptographic keys. By exploiting this downgrade capability, an attacker can cause an IV (Initialization Vector) reuse.
- **IV Reuse:** The keyblob downgrade allows triggering an IV reuse, which is a cryptographic vulnerability that can lead to the decryption of data or the compromise of cryptographic operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The document states that the IV reuse vulnerability is triggered with a privileged process. This implies that exploitation could lead to the compromise of cryptographic operations, potentially allowing for:
    - Data decryption
    - Unauthorized access to secure resources
    - Tampering with cryptographic integrity

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an attacker exploiting the keyblob downgrade capability within the Keymaster TA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Keymaster TA in a way that enables the keyblob downgrade. 
- Additionally, the attacker would need to be able to trigger the IV reuse through a privileged process which suggests that they would need some level of access already to execute the privileged process.

**Additional Notes**
- The document also specifies that the fix for this vulnerability is to remove the legacy implementation for minor keyblob.
- Affected versions are Android P(9.0), Q(10.0), and R(11.0)
- The vulnerability was privately disclosed, and fixed in SMR Oct-2021 Release 1
