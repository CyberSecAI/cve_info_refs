- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape the `body` parameter in the `url_addon/gtranslate-email.php` file before outputting it back to the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious script in the `body` parameter sent to `url_addon/gtranslate-email.php`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the `NONCE_SALT` and `NONCE_KEY`, and needs to convince a user to submit a crafted form.
