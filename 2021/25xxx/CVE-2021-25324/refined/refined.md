```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The galaxy cluster names were vulnerable to XSS injection because the `value` field of `GalaxyCluster` was not properly sanitized before being displayed in the view.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the galaxy cluster name, which would then be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other unauthorized actions within the user's session.
- Attack vectors: The attacker could inject malicious code by manipulating the `value` field of a galaxy cluster.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to modify/create a galaxy cluster with a malicious name.
