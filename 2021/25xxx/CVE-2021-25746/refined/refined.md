{
  "CVE-2021-25746": {
    "Description": "A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where a user that can create or update ingress objects can use .metadata.annotations in an Ingress object (in the networking.k8s.io or extensions API group) to obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.",
    "Root cause": "Improper input validation on annotations within Ingress objects.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Directive injection via annotations"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition or modification of data. Specifically, an attacker can gain access to the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller, which in default configurations has access to all secrets in the cluster.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or update Ingress objects and also needs to have a low level of privileges to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the .metadata.annotations field within an Ingress object. This allows an attacker to inject malicious directives that can compromise the ingress-nginx controller. Multitenant environments are more prone to exploitation if non-admin users can create Ingress objects. The issue was fixed in ingress-nginx version 1.2.0, with a mitigation available through implementing an admission policy that restricts values in annotations."
