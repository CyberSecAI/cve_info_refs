- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Futurio Extra plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `dilaz_mb_query_select` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI). The vulnerability can be exploited using a crafted `q` parameter in a POST request to `admin-ajax.php`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Data Extraction**: Attackers can extract data from the database, potentially revealing sensitive information.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: By injecting malicious code into the SQL query, an attacker can perform XSS attacks against logged-in administrators, by crafting malicious links.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `dilaz_mb_query_select`, a malicious `q` parameter, and other required parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with high privileges to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
