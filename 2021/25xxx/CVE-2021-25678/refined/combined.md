SSA-574442: Multiple PAR and DFT File Parsing Vulnerabilities in
Solid Edge

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2021-04-13
2021-06-08
V1.1

SUMMARY

Siemens has released a new version for Solid Edge to ﬁx multiple vulnerabilities that could be triggered
when the application reads ﬁles in different ﬁle formats (PAR, DFT extensions). If a user is tricked to open
a malicious ﬁle with the affected application, this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary
code execution or data extraction on the target host system.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version and to avoid opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources.

• Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources in Solid Edge

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Solid Edge is a portfolio of software tools that addresses various product development processes : 3D
design, simulation, manufacturing and design management.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-28385

Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DFT ﬁles. This could
result in an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this
vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-12049)
