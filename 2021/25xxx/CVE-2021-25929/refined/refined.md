### CVE-2021-25929
Based on the provided information, this CVE relates to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in OpenNMS Horizon and OpenNMS Meridian.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation on the `name` parameter within the `noticeWizard` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input validation on the `name` parameter in the `noticeWizard` endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other administrators.
- This could lead to the execution of malicious code within the context of the affected OpenNMS instance.
- Could trick admin users into downloading malicious files.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of OpenNMS.
- An attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- The malicious payload is stored in the application and is triggered when another user accesses the affected functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid authentication credentials to log in to the OpenNMS application with administrative privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the "opennms/admin/notification/noticeWizard/choosePath.jsp" endpoint.
- The attacker must be able to insert the payload into the "Name" field.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects versions of OpenNMS Horizon from `opennms-1-0-stable` through `opennms-27.1.0-1`.
- It also affects versions of OpenNMS Meridian from `meridian-foundation-2015.1.0-1` through `meridian-foundation-2019.1.18-1` and from `meridian-foundation-2020.1.0-1` through `meridian-foundation-2020.1.6-1`.
- The fix involves upgrading to Horizon 2.7.1.1, Meridian 2020.1.7, or Meridian 2019.1.19.
- The provided code diffs show where input escaping was added to various javascript files and JSPs to mitigate the issue.

The vulnerability is present in the `noticeWizard` functionality of OpenNMS, specifically in the `choosePath.jsp` file. This file does not properly sanitize user inputs before using them within the HTML context, leading to the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

The fix implemented in commit `66c1f626bf38a7d1a9530b4d68598269ee5245a2` and backported in commit `eb08b5ed4c5548f3e941a1f0d0363ae4439fa98c` involves encoding user inputs with `WebSecurityUtils.sanitizeString()` and `_.escape()` before they are displayed or used in the application to prevent XSS.
