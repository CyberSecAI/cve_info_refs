- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A panic within the user-provided function `f` in the `map_array` function leads to a double drop of a single object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Double drop of an object due to a panic in a user-provided function. This is a memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service due to the double free and memory corruption. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network, with low attack complexity, no required privileges and no user interaction required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable `map_array` function with a user-provided function that can panic. The vulnerability is exposed remotely so no local position is needed.
