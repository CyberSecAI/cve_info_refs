Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-25828:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the Emby Server when handling GET requests to the `/web` endpoint. Specifically, everything after `/web/` in the URL is reflected in the response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they access a maliciously crafted URL. This could lead to:
   - Session hijacking
   - Stealing sensitive information (cookies, user credentials)
   - Defacing the web page
   - Redirecting users to malicious sites
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a network request.
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code after `/web/` and tricks a user into clicking the link. For example: `http://<ip>:8096/web/<script>alert(document.location)</script>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a crafted URL to a target user. They also require the victim to access the manipulated link.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects the *nux version of Emby Media Server. The Windows version appears to not be affected.
- The issue was resolved in version 4.6.0.50 of Emby Server.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 6.1, indicating moderate severity.
