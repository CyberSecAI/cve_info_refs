The provided content is related to a commit that addresses a security issue in MISP by enforcing password confirmation by default.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability existed because password confirmation was optional and not enabled by default in MISP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of enforced password confirmation during sensitive operations like user account changes or modifications.
- This allowed for potentially unauthorized modifications if an attacker gained access to a user's session and the user did not have to reconfirm the password for changes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could exploit this weakness by modifying settings or data that should be password protected if the user has an active session.

**Attack vectors:**
- Session hijacking: An attacker could potentially compromise a user's session and exploit the lack of password confirmation to make unauthorized changes.
- Social engineering: An attacker could trick a user into performing actions that would normally require password confirmation, while bypassing the confirmation step.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to gain access to an active user session or trick the user into performing a malicious action within their valid session, or the attacker would need to be able to make changes in the configuration file without proper authentication.
