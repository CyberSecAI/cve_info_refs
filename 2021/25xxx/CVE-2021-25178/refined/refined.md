Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-25178:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow within the Open Design Alliance (ODA) Drawings SDK. This occurs during the parsing of specially crafted DXF and DWG files, specifically when the "recover" operation is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-size stack buffer. This allows an attacker to write past the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Denial of Service:** Exploitation can also lead to a crash, potentially resulting in denial of service.
- **Data Extraction:** Although not the main focus, one of the ZDI advisories notes that an attacker could leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, and an out-of-bounds read vulnerability is also associated with the same CVE. The possibility of data extraction in this scenario is not clear.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted DXF or DWG file.
- **User Interaction:** The user must be tricked into opening the malicious file using an application that utilizes the vulnerable ODA Drawings SDK. Specifically, the recover functionality must be invoked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** While the provided text indicates "remote attackers", the attack vector requires the victim to open a malicious file locally.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the user to open a specially crafted file within a vulnerable application.

**Additional Technical Details**
- The vulnerability is located within the Open Design Alliance (ODA) Drawings SDK.
- The specific flaw is triggered when parsing DXF and DWG files using the "recover" operation.
-  The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack buffer.
- This issue affects Siemens products such as JT2Go and COMOS.
- ZDI identifies multiple vulnerability reports associated with this CVE, ZDI-21-220 and ZDI-21-243.
- The vulnerability is fixed in ODA Drawings SDK version 2021.11 and later.
