### Bug Description

Vulnerabilities in Apport in ubuntu 20.04/18.04

================================================

SUMMARY

-------

We found several vulnerabilities in apport program which work on default installations of ubuntu 20.04/18.04.

We were able to chain those vulnerabilities together to get local privilege escalation to root from an unprivileged user.

Issue 1: Bypass drop\_privileges and set Uid and Gid to arbitrary value

--------------------------------------------------------------

real\_uid and real\_gid are set by reading /proc/pid/status file and parsing its content.

"get\_pid\_info" function will iterate through each line and if a line starts with "Uid:" or "Gid:" it takes the first argument in that line and puts it into real\_uid and real\_gid variables.

We were able to bypass this by crashing a process with a file name set to "a\rUid: 0\rGid: 0".

When the process crashed, we "injected" those values to /proc/pid/status file (in the Name field), causing apport to never really drop privileges in the function drop\_privileges( real\_uid now is 0 and real\_gid is also 0).

By having full control over real\_uid and real\_gid we were able to bypass the suid check on "write\_user\_coredump" function.

Issue 2: Bypass get\_process\_startime check

---------------------------------------------------------

Apport checks if the process was replaced after the crash by comparing between apport\_start and process\_start.

process\_start gets the start time of the process by parsing the content of /proc/pid/stat file.

The start time is extracted from the 22 column of the /proc/pid/stat file.

We were able to bypass this check by recycle the pid with a process with " "(space) in its filename, causing get\_process\_starttime to return the wrong value (which is smaller than apport\_start).

Issue 3: delay apport get\_pid\_info by 30 seconds and recycle pid to suid process

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We were able to delay apport get\_pid by 30 seconds from the process creation by acquiring the lock file of apport.

We were able to lock the file by creating a fifo file with a predictable name file crash in /var/log, and then create a new instance of apport.

Now when we create another apport instance it will then be locked for 30 seconds before getting a timeout.

We can release the lock file of the first instance by writing to the fifo file.

Exploitation:

---------------------------------------------------------

Our main goal in the exploitation is to write core file owned by root with our content to an arbitrary directory.

Apport creates a core file in the current directory of the crashed process.

As seen before on other apport exploits, we will create a core file in /etc/logrotate.d/ directory and execute a root shell.

In order to exploit those issues to gain local privilege escalation we need to perform the following steps:

1. Create unpackaged=true configuration in ~/.conf/apport/settings

2. mkfifo a predictable file of a decoy process.

3. Run the decoy process causing the first apport instance to "hang".

4. Create a symlink to /usr/bin/sudo with the name "a\rUid: 0\rGid: 0"

5. chdir to desired directory.

6. Create the crash program.

7. Fork lots of new processes to make the pid wrap to crash\_program\_pid - 1.

8. Send SIGSEGV to crash the program and trigger an additional apport instance.

9. Send SIGKILL to terminate the program and release crash\_program\_pid.

10. Create new process with fork and execve("a/rUid: 0\rGid: 0"). (The crafted file name)

11. Release the first process by writing to the fifo file.

The second apport instance will continue with execution and create a core dump in the current directory of the new suid process.

Now we have a root owned core file in desired directory, we can exploit this by having a valid configuration for logrotate inside the core dump and place the core dump inside /etc/logrotate.d/ directory.

Please note that we follow the community standard of 90 days before public disclosure please coordinate your patch release date with us.

Attaching poc of the exploit, run as follows:

1. tar zxvfm exploit.tar.gz

2. cd exploit

3. ./exploit.sh

Hi,

Attached is the patch we plan on using.

We propose making this public and releasing updates on 2020-02-02 18:00:00 UTC.

Is that date acceptable for you?

Thanks!

Hi,

Thank you for the fast response!

Yes 2021-02-02 18:00:00 UTC would be great date to post fixes.

As we plan to post in our blog with POC attached as well, we will wait additional week until 2021-02-09 with our blog post(as requested in your disclosure policy). Would it be OK?

The patch looks great! but I noticed that os.open would still be blocked on FIFO files, maybe O\_NONBLOCK would help?

Thank you,

Oh, thanks! I definitely forgot to put O\_NONBLOCK there. Nice catch!
