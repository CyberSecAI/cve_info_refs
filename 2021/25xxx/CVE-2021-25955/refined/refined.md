  "cveId": "CVE-2021-25955",
  "related": true,
  "info": {
    "rootCause": "The Dolibarr ERP CRM WYSIWYG Editor module is vulnerable to stored XSS.",
    "vulnerability": "A stored XSS vulnerability exists in the Private Note field of the Dolibarr ERP CRM's WYSIWYG Editor module. This allows a low-privileged user to store malicious scripts.",
    "impact": "An attacker can execute malicious scripts in a victim's browser when the victim opens the page containing the vulnerable field. If the victim is an administrator, this could lead to session ID extraction and full account takeover. An improper access control vulnerability on private notes allows a low-privileged user to update the private notes, enabling privilege escalation.",
    "attackVector": "The attack vector is network-based, where the attacker crafts and injects malicious scripts into the application's database via a web interface.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "A low-privileged attacker is able to inject malicious scripts through the WYSIWYG editor. The attacker also requires the ability to set up servers to host malicious scripts and receive session IDs.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability can be exploited by first creating a malicious JS file and hosting it on a server, then injecting the crafted payload into a private note via a modified request, and finally, when an administrator views this note, their session ID is sent to attacker. This allows the attacker to impersonate the admin."
