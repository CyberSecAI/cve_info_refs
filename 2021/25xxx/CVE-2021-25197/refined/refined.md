The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in a Content Management System (version 1.0): a reflected XSS vulnerability and an arbitrary file upload vulnerability.

**Reflected XSS Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `search.php` file. It appears that user-supplied input to the search functionality is not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML output, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker would inject a malicious script into the search parameter within the URL, which would then be reflected back in the response.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload, and either socially engineer a user to click the link or leverage other means to deliver the crafted URL to the targeted user.

**Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability exists in the `admin/new_content.php` file. The application allows users to upload files without proper validation or sanitization, allowing the upload of arbitrary files, including executable code such as a webshell.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper file type validation and sanitization during the upload process.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload a webshell or other malicious files to the server, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), compromising the server and potentially the entire application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker would upload a malicious file through the file upload functionality in `new_content.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrative user to access the vulnerable file upload functionality.
