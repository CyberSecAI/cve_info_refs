Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-25050

**Root Cause:** The "Remove Footer Credit" WordPress plugin versions prior to 1.0.11 did not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the plugin settings. Specifically, the plugin allowed users with high privileges (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code into the "Step 2: Enter your own footer credit (one per line)" field, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin stored unsanitized user input in the database, which was then rendered on the website without proper sanitization.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin failed to sanitize the user-provided input in the settings page, specifically the "find" and "replace" fields. Although there is `jabrfc_kses` present, it appears to be not sufficient or used improperly.
*   **Lack of Output Encoding:** The plugin did not properly encode the output of the settings fields, allowing injected scripts to execute in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would execute in the browsers of other users who visited the affected website.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  Attackers could potentially steal session cookies.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could potentially modify the website's content.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could inject code to distribute malware to site visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Plugin Settings:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, specifically the "Step 1: Enter text/HTML to remove (one per line)" field and "Step 2: Enter your own footer credit (one per line)" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level access (or other high-privilege access) to the WordPress dashboard to modify plugin settings.
*   **Ability to modify settings:** The attacker must be able to access and modify the plugin's settings page.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to inject the XSS payload.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.0.11 of the plugin, which introduces sanitization and escapes.
*   The changesets show the code changes made to fix the sanitization and escaping of user inputs. Specifically, `sanitize_text_field` is added, along with escaping output through `esc_textarea` and `esc_attr`.
*   The CVSS score is 3.5 (low) because it requires high privileges (admin access) to exploit.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79, which is for Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
* The vulnerability was discovered and submitted by `apple502j`

**Summary:**
This is a Stored XSS vulnerability in the "Remove Footer Credit" WordPress plugin, where high-privilege users could inject arbitrary JavaScript code through the plugin settings. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.0.11 by adding sanitization and escaping.
