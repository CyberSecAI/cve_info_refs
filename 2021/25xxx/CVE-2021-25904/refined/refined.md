- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Frame::copy_from_raw_parts()` function in the `av-data` crate allows dereferencing a raw pointer provided as input. This enables reading from arbitrary memory addresses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The safe API `Frame::copy_from_raw_parts()` dereferences a raw pointer, leading to potential out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary memory locations by supplying malicious raw pointers. Providing invalid memory addresses can also cause the program to crash (segfault).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious raw pointer to the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a controlled raw pointer to the `Frame::copy_from_raw_parts()` function. The attack can be performed remotely with no privileges or user interaction.
