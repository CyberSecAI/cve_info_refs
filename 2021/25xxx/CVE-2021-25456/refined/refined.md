Based on the provided text, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-25456:

**CVE-2021-25456: OOB read vulnerability in 'libswmfextractor.so'**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability exists in the `libswmfextractor.so` library. Specifically, the code lacks proper length checks, which can lead to reading beyond the allocated memory boundaries.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
    *   Missing length check when handling data within the `libswmfextractor.so` library.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Attackers can trigger the vulnerability using a crafted WMF file.
    *   This can result in arbitrary memory access via `memcpy` at an unintended address, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   A malicious actor would need to craft a WMF file with specific properties that would trigger the OOB read within the `libswmfextractor.so` library when it's processed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted WMF file to be processed by the vulnerable software, which is likely achieved by getting the device to process a malicious file through its media handling mechanisms.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in devices running Android versions O(8.1), P(9.0), Q(10.0), and R(11.0).
*   The fix involves adding a length check in the `libswmfextractor.so` library to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
*   This vulnerability was privately disclosed.
*   This issue was addressed in the SMR (Security Maintenance Release) of September 2021.
