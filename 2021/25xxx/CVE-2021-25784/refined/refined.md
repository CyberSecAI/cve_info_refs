Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection present in the "Edit article" functionality within the Taocms application. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `admin/admin.php?action=cms&ctrl=edit` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Blind SQL Injection: The application doesn't directly output the results of the SQL query, making it a blind SQL injection. Attackers must rely on time-based techniques or other side-channel methods to confirm the injection and extract information.
- Unsanitized input: The `id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Data exfiltration: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by using SQL injection techniques, including user credentials, personal information, and other critical data.
- Unauthorized access: Depending on the database privileges, an attacker might be able to modify, create, or delete data, escalate privileges, and potentially compromise the entire system.
- Application compromise: The injected code can potentially be used to disrupt the application functionality or even to execute commands on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

- HTTP GET request: The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, including malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.
-  Vulnerable URL: `/admin/admin.php?action=cms&id=[SQL Injection Payload]&ctrl=edit`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Access to the admin interface: The attacker needs to have access to the admin interface to reach the vulnerable "Edit article" functionality.
- Knowledge of SQL injection: The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques to exploit the vulnerability.
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests: The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests containing malicious SQL payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided PoC is `/admin/admin.php?action=cms&id=30+and+1=3&ctrl=edit` where the id is injected with `30+and+1=3`, which would evaluate to false, indicating time-based or boolean-based SQL injection can be performed.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.0.1 of Taocms.
