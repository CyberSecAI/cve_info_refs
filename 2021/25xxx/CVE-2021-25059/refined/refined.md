- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate if a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure direct object reference/Path Traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a subscriber account can download a full copy of the website, including sensitive files like wp-config.php.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to the `ajaxurl` endpoint with the `action` set to `dpwap_plugin_download_url` and manipulating the `pluginData` parameter to perform a path traversal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a user account on the vulnerable WordPress site (e.g. a subscriber).
