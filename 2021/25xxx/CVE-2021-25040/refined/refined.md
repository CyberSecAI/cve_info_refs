- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `booking_type` parameter before outputting it in an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin page, which could lead to various malicious activities such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via the `booking_type` parameter in the URL of the admin page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter and convince a user with access to the WordPress admin panel to click the link.
