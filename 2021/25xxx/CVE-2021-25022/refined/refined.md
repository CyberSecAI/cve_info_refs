Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input, specifically the `backup_timestamp` and `job_id` parameters, before they are included in the HTML output of admin pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, which is then executed in the context of the user's browser. This is a reflected XSS vulnerability because the injected script is reflected back from the server in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when the user visits a page with a maliciously crafted URL.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The injected JavaScript could be used to steal session cookies, potentially granting the attacker unauthorized access to the user's account.
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying content, changing settings, or performing other unauthorized operations on the WordPress site.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could potentially redirect users to a phishing site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted URL. The attacker crafts a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript code in the `backup_timestamp` or `job_id` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would typically need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious URL (e.g., through email, social media, or other means).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Access:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the WordPress site.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires a logged-in administrator to click the malicious URL for the attack to be successful.
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with the injected JavaScript code.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the plugin handles the `backup_timestamp` and `job_id` parameters. These parameters are taken directly from the request, and are inserted back into the HTML without proper sanitization.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.16.66 of the UpdraftPlus plugin.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a reflected XSS vulnerability, which means that the injected script is not stored on the server but rather reflected back in the response.
* The CVE description was not present in the original text, so it was taken from the WPVDB reference provided in the text.
