Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin does not sanitize some of its parameters used via AJAX actions before outputting them back in the response.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

Attack vectors: By crafting malicious URLs with specific parameters, an attacker can inject javascript code into the page via AJAX requests. 
The vulnerable parameters include 'pid', 'link_target', and 'rand_id' in different AJAX actions provided by the plugin.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to craft malicious URLs and induce a user to click them. No authentication or specific user role is required for successful exploitation.
