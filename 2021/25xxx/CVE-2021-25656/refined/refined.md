- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a weakness that allows stored XSS injection attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities when other users interact with the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through stored XSS injection attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have some level of access or privileges in order to inject the malicious code into the vulnerable application. The CVSS score indicates that a low privileged local user is able to trigger this.
