- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `settingscopy` parameter before outputting it back in an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that is viewed by an administrator or other authorized users, leading to actions being performed in the context of the victim's session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with the `settingscopy` parameter containing the XSS payload. The crafted URL is then delivered to a victim, and when they visit the URL, the XSS payload is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and deliver it to a victim who is logged into the WordPress admin panel of the vulnerable website. The victim has to click on the attacker-controlled URL.
