Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-25290:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `TiffDecode.c` within the Pillow library.
*   It stems from a negative-offset `memcpy` operation with an invalid size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow due to the incorrect use of `memcpy` with a negative offset and invalid size. This could lead to overwriting memory outside the intended buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which could lead to:
    *   **Arbitrary code execution**: An attacker might be able to overwrite memory to control the program's execution flow, potentially executing malicious code.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The overflow might crash the application, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted TIFF image file.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the decoding process in `TiffDecode.c`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TIFF image to an application using the vulnerable Pillow library.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same system, the attack could occur through the processing of a file retrieved over the network, or by processing a file from disk.
