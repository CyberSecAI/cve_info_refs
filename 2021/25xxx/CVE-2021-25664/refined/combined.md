### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 4.2.1    [LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE-835](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/835.html)

The function that processes IPv6 headers does not check the lengths of extension header options, allowing attackers to put this function into an infinite loop with crafted length values.

[CVE-2021-25663](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-25663) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 4.2.2    [LOOP WITH UNREACHABLE EXIT CONDITION ('INFINITE LOOP') CWE-835](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/835.html)

The function that processes the hop-by-hop extension header in IPv6 packets and its options lacks any checks against the length field of the header, allowing attackers to put the function into an infinite loop by supplying arbitrary length values.

[CVE-2021-25664](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-25664) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* For additional mitigation advice contact customer support or the Nucleus Sales team.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens’ [Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and following the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens’ products and solutions, contact [Siemens ProductCERT](https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Nucleus NET module incorporates a wide range of standard-compliant networking and communication
protocols, drivers, and utilities to deliver full-featured network support in any embedded device. The
networking functionality is fully integrated into the Nucleus RTOS ("Nucleus PLUS") and supports a
variety of processors and MCUs.

Nucleus ReadyStart is a platform with integrated software IP, tools, and services ideal for applications
where a small footprint, deterministic performance, and small code size are essential.

Nucleus RTOS is a highly scalable micro-kernel based real-time operating system designed for scalability
and reliability in systems spanning the range of aerospace, industrial, and medical applications. Since
V3, Nucleus RTOS (incl. its modules, e.g. Nucleus NET) is an integral part of the Nucleus ReadyStart
platform.

Capital Embedded AR Classic (formerly called Capital VSTAR), is a scalable AUTOSAR Classic software
platform that meets ISO 26262 use cases for up to ASIL D. Versions are available for several recent
AUTOSAR Classic releases, including 4.3.1 and 20-11. Although not based on Nucleus RTOS, Embedded
AR Classic includes its networking module, Nucleus NET.
