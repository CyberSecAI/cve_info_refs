Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-25664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the function that processes the hop-by-hop extension header in IPv6 packets and its options. This function lacks proper checks against the length field of the header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The absence of length validation in the hop-by-hop extension header processing function.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')" (CWE-835).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The affected function enters an infinite loop, rendering the system unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- Attackers can send specially crafted IPv6 packets containing hop-by-hop extension headers with arbitrary length values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable device.
- No special privileges or user interaction are required (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N).
