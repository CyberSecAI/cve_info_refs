Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25940:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure to invalidate user sessions in ArangoDB when an administrator changes the user's password. This is due to a flaw in the session management logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Session Expiration:** The primary vulnerability is that user sessions remain active even after the user's password has been changed by an administrator. This violates the principle that a password change should invalidate all existing sessions.
*   **Lack of Session Invalidation:** The system does not properly invalidate active sessions when a user's password is changed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** A malicious user who has an active session can continue to perform actions within the system even after their password has been changed, effectively bypassing the intended security measure.
*   **Arbitrary Actions:** An attacker with a valid session could perform arbitrary actions within the system, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities, until the session expires naturally (depending on the configured session timeout).
*   **Compromised Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS v3.1 score indicates a high impact across all three areas: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is via the network, as the malicious user would typically maintain an existing session through network communication.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability specifically affects web interface sessions, or other sessions based on JWTs created by the `/_open/auth` API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid Session:** The attacker needs to have an existing, valid session established in ArangoDB. This can be achieved through normal login procedures.
*   **Knowledge of User Credentials:** The attacker originally had valid credentials for the account.
*   **No User Interaction Required:**  The attacker does not need any specific interaction from the victim/admin after the initial session is established.
*   **Low Privileges Required:**  The attacker requires low privileges because they can exploit the vulnerability with a regular user account.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Versions:** ArangoDB versions v3.7.6 through v3.8.3 are affected.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version v3.9.0-alpha.1 and later by correctly invalidating sessions upon password changes.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The PoC involves logging in with a user, changing their password as an admin, and then observing that the original session remains valid.
*   **CVSS Scores:**
    *   **CVSS v3.1:**  Base Score 8.8 (Network AV, Low AC, Low PR, None UI, Unchanged Scope, High CIA)
    *   **CVSS v2:** Base Score 6.0 (Network AV, Medium AC, Single AU, Partial CIA)
*   **CWE:** The weakness is classified as CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrading to a patched version of ArangoDB is the recommended mitigation strategy.
*   The provided commit `e9c6ee9dcca7b9b4fbcd02a0b323d205bee838d3` on github.com shows the code changes to address this, which is primarily the reintroduction of the `--server.session-timeout` parameter. It also includes changes to the `AuthenticationFeature` to configure this timeout, and changes to `RestAuthHandler` to generate the JWT with the correct session timeout. Finally it includes a test case for verifying this functionality.

In summary, CVE-2021-25940 describes a serious vulnerability in ArangoDB where user sessions are not invalidated after a password change, potentially leading to unauthorized access and malicious activities.
