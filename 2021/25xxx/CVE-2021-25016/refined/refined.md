- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `search` parameter before outputting it in the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin dashboard, potentially leading to actions being performed with the privileges of an admin user.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL containing the javascript payload within the `search` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice an administrator to click on the malicious crafted URL.
