Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `visibility` parameter within the FeedWordPress plugin's admin interface. Specifically, the plugin was not adequately sanitizing user-supplied input before using it in an HTML context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `visibility` parameter, which is then reflected back to the user's browser within the page, leading to execution of the malicious script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the victim's account.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `visibility` parameter.
- A user with access to the FeedWordPress dashboard needs to be lured into clicking on the malicious link while being logged into WordPress.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target WordPress site but requires a logged-in user with access to the FeedWordPress dashboard to click the malicious link. The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL to inject JavaScript code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code was in the `feedwordpresssyndicationpage.class.php` file, specifically within the `visibility_toggle()` function where the `$_REQUEST['visibility']` parameter was not sanitized properly.
- The fix involved implementing `preg_replace('/[^YyNn]+/', '', strip_tags($_REQUEST['visibility']))` to sanitize the visibility parameter, and `esc_url()` when creating URLs to prevent further issues.
- The vulnerability was reported through WPScan and WordPress support channels.
- The provided PoC URL demonstrates how to inject an XSS payload using the `visibility` parameter.
