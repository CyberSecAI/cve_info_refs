- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WPCargo plugin contains a file (`barcode.php`) that allows unauthenticated attackers to write a PHP file anywhere on the web server. This is achieved by manipulating the `text`, `sizefactor`, and `filepath` parameters in the URL. The `text` parameter is used to encode the PHP payload which is then written into a png file using the png algorithm, the `filepath` parameter is used to write it into any location.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to insecure file writing and lack of input sanitization in the `barcode.php` file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the web server.
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `barcode.php` file with crafted URL parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required, and the attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable server.
