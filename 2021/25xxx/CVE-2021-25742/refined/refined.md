{
  "CVE-2021-25742": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2021-25742",
      "Description": "A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where a user that can create or update ingress objects can use the custom snippets feature to obtain all secrets in the cluster."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The custom snippets feature in ingress-nginx allows users with permissions to create or update ingress objects to inject malicious code.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
	      "Insufficient Access Control",
        "Use of Custom Snippets feature in ingress-nginx"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can potentially obtain all secrets in the cluster, leading to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, and possibly further compromise of the system.",
      "Attack Vectors": "Exploitation is done by creating or updating ingress objects with malicious custom snippets.",
      "Required Capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create or update ingress objects within the Kubernetes cluster. This usually involves having a role with sufficient permissions to interact with ingress resources."
    },
    "Additional Information": {
       "Mitigation": "Upgrade to ingress-nginx version v1.0.1 or v0.49.1 or later and set `allow-snippet-annotations` to `false` in the ingress-nginx ConfigMap.",
       "Affected Versions": "Ingress-nginx versions prior to 0.49.1 and v1.0.0 are vulnerable.",
       "EPSS Score": "0.087%"
      }
