Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `manage_event.php` file of the Alumni Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The system is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the `id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
*   Access sensitive data within the database.
*   Modify or delete database records.
*   Potentially gain control over the underlying system, depending on the database server permissions and the application's interaction with the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in a request to the `manage_event.php` file. By manipulating the value of this parameter, an attacker can inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `manage_event.php` file and be able to manipulate the `id` parameter. No specific authentication or prior access is mentioned, suggesting that the vulnerability is likely exploitable without prior credentials.
