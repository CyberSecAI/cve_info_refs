- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks when deleting publications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control (specifically, insufficient authorization) and missing CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Any authenticated user, including low-privileged subscribers, can delete arbitrary publications.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user could craft a request that, when executed by a logged-in user (even a subscriber), deletes publications without proper authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (even a subscriber). They need to induce the target user to execute the crafted malicious request to delete publications.
