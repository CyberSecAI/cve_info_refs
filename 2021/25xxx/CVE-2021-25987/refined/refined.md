Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-25987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the "body" and "tags" sections of blog posts within the Hexo blogging framework. Specifically, malicious JavaScript code included in these fields is not properly neutralized during web page generation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that malicious code is injected into the database or file system and is executed when a user interacts with the compromised data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Injection:** A local, unprivileged attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the blog content.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** The injected JavaScript code can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions, such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing user cookies and session information
    - Modifying the content and layout of the blog
    - Launching further attacks against site visitors
    - Perform any actions that the blog owner could perform within the browser

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local File Modification:** An attacker needs to modify the markdown source files of the blog posts directly. This could occur through:
    - Direct access to the file system where Hexo blog posts are stored
    - Gaining unauthorized access to a web editor or server with access to the blog files
- **Malicious Input:** The attack vector requires injecting malicious JavaScript into the "tags" or "body" fields of a blog post. This could look like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access/Compromised System:** An attacker must have the ability to modify the local blog's source files directly. This can be achieved via:
  - Direct physical or remote access to the system where the blog is hosted
  - Compromised server where the files are located
- **Knowledge of Hexo:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how Hexo stores and renders blog posts.
- **No special privileges needed** on a compromised system.

**Additional Details:**

- **Self-XSS:** The advisory notes that this vulnerability can be categorized as "self-XSS." This highlights that the malicious script is typically executed on the user's system who has access to the server or their own local machine.
- **Breaking Change Fix:** The fix for this vulnerability, which involves escaping HTML entities, is considered a breaking change, and it will be included in Hexo 6.0.0.

**Mitigation:**
- The issue was fixed in the Hexo v6.0.0 release, which implemented HTML entity escaping by default.
- Users who can't upgrade to 6.0.0 are advised to secure their systems and web editors, including implementing strong password policies.

**Note:**
- The content mentions pull request #4743 as the fix but the conversation around the pull request #4750 provides more context and the correct commit hash for the fix.
- There are mentions that this is not a "stored XSS" or "Reflected XSS" but this is incorrect as the injected code is stored and the vulnerable system renders the code without sanitizing it.

The identified vulnerability is a **Stored XSS** that allows for arbitrary JavaScript code to be injected into blog posts when rendered by the Hexo framework. The fix involved escaping HTML by default which is now included in version 6.0.0.
