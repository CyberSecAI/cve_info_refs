- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within form settings, specifically in the "Minimum number of characters required to run ajax search" (min\_no\_for\_search field), "Text when there is no search results" (nothing\_found\_text field), and the `_is_settings[highlight_color]` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Input is not properly escaped, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This could result in session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafted input via the plugin's settings page, specifically by exploiting the `min_no_for_search`, `nothing_found_text` fields and the `_is_settings[highlight_color]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges to modify the plugin settings. Specifically, they need to be able to access the AJAX settings of a Form within the Ivory Search plugin. The unfiltered\_html capability being disallowed does not prevent the attack.
