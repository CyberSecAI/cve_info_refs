- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `updraft_restore` parameter is not sanitized and escaped before being outputted on the Restore page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to actions performed on behalf of the victim, such as session hijacking or data theft.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted URL containing a malicious script within the `updraft_restore` parameter. When a user visits the crafted URL, the malicious script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it. The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the WordPress site. The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker as long as they can get the victim to click on a malicious link.
