- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Landing Page Builder plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to unsanitized input in the `thisPostID` parameter on the `ulpb_post` admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a user's browser session by crafting a malicious URL. This can lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the page.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `thisPostID` parameter and tricking a user into clicking on it while being authenticated to the WordPress admin panel. The vulnerable URL is on the `/wp-admin/edit.php` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince an authenticated user to click on a specially crafted link.
