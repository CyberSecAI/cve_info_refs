| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1182166#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2021-02-12 08:53:26 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1180004](show_bug.cgi?id=1180004 "IN_PROGRESS - AUDIT-TRACKER: review request for Hawk package") +++  3, Insecure file permissions In three different places you set files to unsafe permissions - hawk/app/models/report.rb   147     File.chmod(0666, tmpfile.path)   Only used to generates graph, shouldn't be more than a DoS that someone   that can abuse this cause likely via other vectors. - hawk/app/lib/invoker.rb   69       File.chmod(0666, f.path)   70       CrmEvents.instance.push "crm configure\n#{cmd}\n" unless @no_log   71       result = crm '-F', 'configure', 'load', 'update', f.path   This allows arbitrary local users to change the CIB, which is an issue in   itself, but can be combined with other issues, e.g. 2 to set uname to   something containing shell metacharacters. - hawk/app/lib/crm_script.rb   42   def run(jsondata, rootpw)   43     user = current_user   44     cmd = crmsh_escape(JSON.dump(jsondata))   45     tmpf = Tempfile.new 'crmscript'   46     tmpf.write("script json \"#{cmd}\"")   47     tmpf.close   48     File.chmod(0666, tmpf.path)   49   50     if rootpw.nil?   51       cmdline = ['/usr/sbin/hawk_invoke', user, 'crm', '-f', tmpf.path]   52     else   53       user = 'root'   54       cmdline = ['/usr/bin/su', user, '--shell=/bin/sh', '-c', "/usr/sbin/crm -f #{tmpf.path}", stdin_data: rootpw.lines.first]   55     end   56     old_home = Util.ensure_home_for(user)   57     out, err, status = Util.capture3(*cmdline)   The last one is a root exploit as crm is powerful and can be misused in   various ways  My suggestion is that you don't change the permissions here. I've seen in the comments that you considered doing this anyway ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1182166#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2021-02-12 08:55:06 UTC  ``` This is an embargoed bug. This means that this information is not public. CRD: 2021-05-13 (or earlier, internal finding)  Please do NOT: - talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - make this bug public - submit this into OBS (e.g. fix Leap/Tumbleweed) until this bug becomes public (e.g. no EMBARGOED tag on the header)  Consult with security team if you think that the issue is public and the bug is still private (e.g. subject still contains "EMBARGOED"). Please do NOT make the bug public yourself.  Please be aware that the SUSE:SLE-15-SP3:GA codestream is available via OBS, so do NOT submit there before this is public.  These are the steps that are asked from you: 1, Your primary responsibility is to submit a fix for this issue. Here's a how-to for submitting packages for maintenance releases in IBS:    [https://confluence.suse.com/display/maintenance/How+to+Submit+Packages+or+Containers+to+Maintenance](https://confluence.suse.com/display/maintenance/How%2Bto%2BSubmit%2BPackages%2Bor%2BContainers%2Bto%2BMaintenance)    Apart from the GA codestreams mentioned above, you can submit to IBS anytime. This is private and allows us to start testing as soon as possible. 2, We also want to fix openSUSE if it's affected.    $ is_maintained $PACKAGE    will tell you if the package is inherited from SLES or if it is branched for openSUSE. There are two cases:    - It's coming from SLES: The update will automatically be released for openSUSE. Nothing to do for you.    - It's branched for openSUSE: You need to submit AFTER the bug became public, to the current openSUSE codestreams.    For openSUSE Factory please submit to the devel project of you package AFTER the bug became public.  Security will then take the following steps: - We wait for your submission and package them into an incident for QA testing. The QA tester might reach out to you if they find issues with the update. - Once the coordinated release date (CRD), the date this issue should become public, is reached (or for internal findings: once we're done testing), we remove the EMBARGOED tag from this bug and publish the updates. - Only if the bug here is public you may submit to public repositories (OBS).  You can contact us at:  * IRC: irc.suse.de #security * RocketChat: <https://chat.suse.de/channel/security> * Email: security-team@suse.de ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1182166#c3)  Dario Maiocchi   2021-03-10 15:46:41 UTC  ``` fixed my next 2.6.3 mu ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1182166#c6)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2021-03-15 10:47:03 UTC  ``` Do we have a CRD or should we release when we have ready most of the codestreams? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1182166#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2021-03-18 09:51:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alexandros Toptsoglou from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1182166#c6)) we can release whenever we like, no external CRD ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1182166#c10)  Johannes Segitz   2021-03-24 12:30:26 UTC  ``` Update was released ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1182166#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2021-03-24 14:27:12 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2021:0941-1: An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has one errata is now available.
