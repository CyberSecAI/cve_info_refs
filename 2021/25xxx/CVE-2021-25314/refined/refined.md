- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure file permissions set on temporary files created by the `hawk2` application. Specifically, files were created with `0666` permissions, allowing any local user to read and write them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure file permissions (0666) on temporary files.
    - Ability for local users to modify the Cluster Information Base (CIB) through `hawk/app/lib/invoker.rb`.
    - Potential root exploit through `hawk/app/lib/crm_script.rb`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Denial of Service (DoS)** through modification of graph generation files (`hawk/app/models/report.rb`).
    - **Arbitrary CIB manipulation** by local users, potentially leading to cluster disruption and unauthorized actions.
    - **Root privilege escalation** through misuse of the crm utility (`hawk/app/lib/crm_script.rb`).
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Exploitation of insecure file permissions by local users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the system.
