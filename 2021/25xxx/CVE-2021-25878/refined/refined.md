Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-25878:

**CVE-2021-25878: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `videosList.php` file. Specifically, the `videoName` parameter obtained from the `$_GET` request is used directly in JavaScript code without proper encoding or validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Reflected XSS:** The `videoName` parameter is reflected directly in the HTML output without any sanitization, making the application vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `videoName` parameter.
    *   When a user visits the crafted URL, the injected script will execute within their browser in the context of the vulnerable website, potentially leading to:
        *   Stealing session cookies and hijacking user sessions.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the user, including those with administrative privileges.
        *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
        *   Defacing the website.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to craft a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript code within the `videoName` parameter.
    *   The attacker would then need to trick a user into visiting the malicious URL, potentially through social engineering.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs and distribute them to the target users.

**Technical Details**

The vulnerable code snippet from `view/videosList.php` is:
```php
$videoName = "";
if (!empty($video['clean_title'])) {
    $videoName = $video['clean_title'];
} else if (!empty($_GET['videoName'])) {
    $videoName = $_GET['videoName'];
}
[...]
var urlList = "<?php echo $global['webSiteRootURL']; ?>videosList/<?php echo addslashes($catLink); ?>video/<?php echo addslashes($videoName); ?>" + page + query;

```
The vulnerability lies in the fact that `$_GET['videoName']` is directly used in the javascript `urlList` variable after being processed by the `addslashes` php function, which is insufficient to prevent XSS.

**Example Exploit:**

The document provides the following example of a URL that can be used to trigger the XSS:

`http://<target>/videosList/video/%253c%252fscript%253e%253cscript%253ealert%25281%2529%253c%252fscript%253e/page/1`

This URL injects the following script:

`<script>alert(1)</script>`

**Additional Notes:**

* The document also mentions other XSS vulnerabilities related to the `searchPhrase`, `u` and `redirectUri` parameters, but those are not related to CVE-2021-25878.
*   The advisory also describes an SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-25874) and a file write vulnerability (CVE-2021-25877), but those are distinct from CVE-2021-25878.

In summary, CVE-2021-25878 is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the `videosList.php` file that can be exploited by crafting a specific URL with a malicious payload in the videoName parameter, potentially leading to session hijacking and other malicious actions.
