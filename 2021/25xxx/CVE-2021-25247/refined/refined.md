- **Root cause of vulnerability:** DLL hijacking vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application loads a DLL in an unsafe manner, allowing an attacker to replace a legitimate DLL with a malicious one.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable application will load it from.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must already have user privileges on the machine.
