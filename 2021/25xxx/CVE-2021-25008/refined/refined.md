- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `snippets-safe-mode` parameter is not properly escaped before being outputted in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which are then executed by the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**  By crafting a malicious URL containing the payload in the vulnerable `snippets-safe-mode` parameter, the attacker can trick a victim into clicking the link, causing the injected script to execute in the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting that URL. The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges.
