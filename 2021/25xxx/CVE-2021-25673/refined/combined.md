SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities affecting SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM V5.4 could allow an attacker with local access to
the system to craft special project ﬁles that may lead to denial-of-service attacks.

Siemens recommends speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations.

SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM V5.4:
All versions

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to project ﬁles on the engineering station to trusted users.

• Only use project ﬁles from trusted sources.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM V5.4 is a Windows application that simulates the execution of user programs for the
SIMATIC S7-300 CPU, S7-400 CPU, and WinAC families of controllers.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-25673

An attacker with local access to the system could cause a Denial-of-Service condition in the application
when it is used to open a specially crafted ﬁle. As a consequence, the application could enter an
inﬁnite loop, become unresponsive and must be restarted to restore the service.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-25674

An attacker with local access to the system could cause a Denial-of-Service condition in the application
when it is used to open a specially crafted ﬁle. As a consequence, a NULL pointer deference condition
could cause the application to terminate unexpectedly and must be restarted to restore the service.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-25675

An attacker with local access to the system could cause a Denial-of-Service condition in the application
when it is used to open a specially crafted ﬁle. As a consequence, a divide by zero operation could
occur and cause the application to terminate unexpectedly and must be restarted to restore the
service.
