- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin's AJAX action `wpdevart_duplicate_post_parametrs_save_in_db` lacks proper authorization and has a flawed CSRF check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Missing Authorization**: Any authenticated user, including subscribers, can call the vulnerable AJAX action.
    - **Flawed CSRF check**: The CSRF check is insufficient, allowing for CSRF attacks.
    - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Due to a lack of escaping of user-controlled input (`title_prefix`), malicious JavaScript can be injected and stored, leading to XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary settings update in the plugin.
    - Stored XSS, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the administrator's browser session when they access the plugin settings page, leading to potential account takeover or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Direct AJAX call:** An attacker can directly send a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable action and malicious payload.
    - **CSRF attack:** An attacker can craft a malicious link or form that, when clicked by an authenticated user, will send the same POST request without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site (e.g., a subscriber).
    - Alternatively, if performing a CSRF attack, the attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into triggering the request.
