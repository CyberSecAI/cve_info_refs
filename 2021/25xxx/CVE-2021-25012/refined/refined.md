- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape multiple parameters before outputting them on admin dashboard pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin dashboard pages, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious URLs with XSS payloads in the `keyword` and `extraction` parameters, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when an admin user visits these crafted URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft specific URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads. An administrator must then be tricked into visiting this crafted URL, often by being sent through social engineering or other deceptive means.
