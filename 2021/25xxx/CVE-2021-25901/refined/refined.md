- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `lazy-init` crate lacks a `Send` bound for its `Lazy` type, which can lead to data races.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing `Send` bound for the `Lazy` type, allowing data races.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Data races in safe code, leading to potential memory corruption and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Network (as per CVSS vector).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific capabilities or positions are explicitly mentioned in the provided text other than network access according to the CVSS score. The vulnerability is exploitable by any user of the affected crate.
