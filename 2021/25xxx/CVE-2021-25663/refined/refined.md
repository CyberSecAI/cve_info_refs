Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25663:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the IPv6 stack of Nucleus NET, where the function processing IPv6 headers fails to validate the lengths of extension header options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input validation of extension header option lengths within IPv6 packet processing.
- Lack of boundary checks, allowing crafted length values to be used in header processing.
- The absence of these checks leads to an infinite loop within the processing function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): Attackers can trigger an infinite loop, causing the affected system to become unresponsive and unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted IPv6 packets over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the affected device is necessary.
- The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges.
- The attack complexity is low.
- No user interaction is needed for the attack.
