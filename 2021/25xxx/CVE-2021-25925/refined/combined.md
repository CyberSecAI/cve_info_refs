# CVE-2021-25925

#### Date: April 12, 2021

#### Overview

in SiCKRAGE, versions 4.2.0 to 10.0.11.dev1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) due to user input not being validated properly when processed by the server. Therefore, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code inside the application, and possibly steal a user’s sensitive information.
#### Details

The application `SiCKRAGE` is vulnerable to Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS) as user input from several functions is not sanitized. The attack can be exploited from inputs such as the `Post Processing Dir` field in the config/postProcessing/ endpoint, the `Black hole folder location` field in the config/search/ endpoint and using the `quicksearch` bar feature.
#### PoC Details

Within the SiCKRAGE site, go to the `config/search/` or `config/postProcessing/` endpoint. For the `config/search/` endpoint: Under the `torrent-client` tab Inject the given payload into the ”BLack hole folder location” field and submit the values. Then navigate to the `logs/view/` endpoint and observe the payload getting executed. For the `config/postProcessing/` endpoint: Inject the given payload into the ”Post Processing Dir” field and submit the values. Then navigate to the `home/serverstatus/` endpoint and observe the payload getting executed.
#### PoC Code

```
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```

#### Affected Environments

4.2.0-10.0.11.dev1
#### Prevention

Upgrade to version 10.0.11.dev2

#### Language: Python

## Cut security risks up to 70% with full-scale automated dependency updates

### Automated dependency updates

Streamline the process of keeping your software projects up-to-date and improve development efficiency.

Mend Renovate Enterprise automatically identifies outdated dependencies and creates pull requests (PRs) that suggest updates for both open source and private packages, ensuring your dependencies are always current.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Automated-dependency-updates.svg)

### Full-scale automation & support

Mend Renovate Enterprise scales to scan all of your repositories without slowing down, no matter how large your organization or applications become.

Plus, dedicated support from our team of experts ensures you get the most out of Mend Renovate Enterprise.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Full-scale-automation-support-1.svg)

### Technical debt reduction

Avoid development roadblocks caused by an accumulation of technical debt from outdated dependencies.

Mend Renovate Enterprise’s scalable automation for dependency updates minimizes technical debt by ensuring dependencies are current across all repositories.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Technical-debt-reduction-5.svg)

### Merge Confidence ratings & workflows

Mend Renovate Enterprise lets you know the impact each dependency update will have on your application.

Merge Confidence ratings and workflows prevent updates from creating extra work, by providing the likelihood an update will pass without breaking your application and grouping these updates together.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Merge-Confidence-ratings-workflows-1.svg)

### Integrates with your repos

Mend Renovate Enterprise integrates directly into your repositories to support – not overwhelm – your devs as they work on dependency updates.

[See integrations](/integrations/)

MTTR
Fast, secure, compliant
Rapid results

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WTW-Slider-Logo2-1-1.png)

Andrei Ungureanu,
Security Architect

[Read case study](https://www.mend.io/customer-success-stories/wtw-uses-mend-to-reduce-mttr/)

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Frame-1707480008.png)

Chris Wallace,
Senior Security Architect

[Read case study](https://www.mend.io/customer-success-stories/vonage/)

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

## Transform your program with proactive **application security**

### Automated dependency updates

Open source code has nearly always been updated by the time a vulnerability has been published, so automated dependency updates are one of the most effective methods available for eradicating vulnerabilities.

**83%**

Vulnerability reduction for teams that consistently update new versions within 48 hours of publication.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/platform-dependency-updates-1.svg)

### Complete visibility and control

A unified view that prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities and gives teams crucial information, control, and oversight to make smart decisions and deploy security policies at scale.

**85%**

Increase in real-time application visibility

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Complete-visibility-and-control.svg)

### Spotlight experience

To rapidly identify and mitigate high-risk vulnerabilities, developers must quickly narrow down what matters most—which means developers need an embedded experience that highlights what’s critical.

**3X**

Risk reduction; time to remediation is cut by 75 percent.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Spotlight-experience-platform-img.svg)

### Incredible scalability

Cutting through the complex sprawl of existing tools to centralize and scale deployment is crucial for consistent developer adoption and policy implementation.

**71 Days**

Of Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR) – critical and high vulnerabilities

MTTR
Fast, secure, compliant
Rapid results

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

## An approach to AppSec that helps developer **AND** security teams

Developer and security teams have the same AppSec destination—but they use different routes to get there. And when each team has fundamentally different needs, one tool will not fit all. That’s why we offer different—but complementary—solutions for each team.

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

# CVE-2021-25925

#### Date: April 12, 2021

#### Overview

in SiCKRAGE, versions 4.2.0 to 10.0.11.dev1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) due to user input not being validated properly when processed by the server. Therefore, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code inside the application, and possibly steal a user’s sensitive information.
#### Details

The application `SiCKRAGE` is vulnerable to Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS) as user input from several functions is not sanitized. The attack can be exploited from inputs such as the `Post Processing Dir` field in the config/postProcessing/ endpoint, the `Black hole folder location` field in the config/search/ endpoint and using the `quicksearch` bar feature.
#### PoC Details

Within the SiCKRAGE site, go to the `config/search/` or `config/postProcessing/` endpoint. For the `config/search/` endpoint: Under the `torrent-client` tab Inject the given payload into the ”BLack hole folder location” field and submit the values. Then navigate to the `logs/view/` endpoint and observe the payload getting executed. For the `config/postProcessing/` endpoint: Inject the given payload into the ”Post Processing Dir” field and submit the values. Then navigate to the `home/serverstatus/` endpoint and observe the payload getting executed.
#### PoC Code

```
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```

#### Affected Environments

4.2.0-10.0.11.dev1
#### Prevention

Upgrade to version 10.0.11.dev2

#### Language: Python

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-rmp7-f2vp-3rq4)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-rmp7-f2vp-3rq4/dependabot)

## Package

pip

sickrage
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 4.2.0, <= 10.0.11.dev1

## Patched versions

10.0.11.dev2

## Description

in SiCKRAGE, versions 4.2.0 to 10.0.11.dev1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) due to user input not being validated properly when processed by the server. Therefore, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code inside the application, and possibly steal a user’s sensitive information.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## An approach to AppSec that helps developer **AND** security teams

Developer and security teams have the same AppSec destination—but they use different routes to get there. And when each team has fundamentally different needs, one tool will not fit all. That’s why we offer different—but complementary—solutions for each team.

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”
