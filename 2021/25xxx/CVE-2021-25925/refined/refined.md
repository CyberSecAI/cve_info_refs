  "cveId": "CVE-2021-25925",
  "description": "in SiCKRAGE, versions 4.2.0 to 10.0.11.dev1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) due to user input not being validated properly when processed by the server. Therefore, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code inside the application, and possibly steal a user’s sensitive information.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "User input from several functions is not sanitized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code inside the application, and possibly steal a user’s sensitive information.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "`Post Processing Dir` field in the config/postProcessing/ endpoint",
      "`Black hole folder location` field in the config/search/ endpoint",
      "using the `quicksearch` bar feature"
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs access to the SiCKRAGE application to inject the malicious payload. The user interaction is also required to trigger the execution of the malicious javascript."
