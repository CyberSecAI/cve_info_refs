- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting items.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allows for arbitrary post deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete arbitrary posts without their consent or knowledge.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious link or webpage that triggers the deletion action when a logged-in administrator visits it. The vulnerable URL is `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nxssnap-reposter&item=1&action=delete`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no specific capabilities other than the ability to craft a malicious request, and the victim must be a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site.
