Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Apache OFBiz handles exceptions during user login attempts. Specifically, when a user attempts to log in with a password that is too long (exceeding the storage capacity of the `UserLoginHistory.passwordUsed` field), a try-catch block intended to handle the error instead leaks sensitive database table information in the error message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of sensitive information in the error messages, specifically database table info.
- **Improper Error Handling:** The try-catch block, instead of suppressing or sanitizing the error, exposes internal details that an attacker could use for further reconnaissance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Reconnaissance:**  The leaked information can aid an attacker in understanding the underlying database structure and potentially other sensitive aspects of the application, which can be used to plan further attacks.
- **Limited confidentiality impact:** The leaked information is related to db schema and does not directly reveal sensitive user data.
- **Low availability impact:** A failed login attempt could generate a large error message, but does not impact system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is network-based, as the attacker interacts with the application's login interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **No privileges required:** The attacker needs no specific user privileges to exploit the issue.
-   **Network access to login:** The attacker must have the ability to access the login page of the Apache OFBiz application through the network.
-   **Knowledge of the application login path:** The attacker must know the correct endpoint for the login page (e.g. `<https://host/ecommerce/control/login>`).
-   **Ability to create a user:** The attacker must be able to register a new user with a long password.
-   **Ability to construct a long password:** The attacker needs to be able to create a user with a password that exceeds the storage limits.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** Apache OFBiz versions v17.12.01 to v17.12.07.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version release17.12.08.
- **CWE:** CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information.
- **CVSS v3.1 Score:** 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L)
- **CVSS v2 Score:** 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
- The fix involves modifying the `userLogin` method in the `LoginServices.java` file to check the size of the password and store a fixed string (" TOO LONG FOR STORAGE ") instead of the actual password if it exceeds the storage capacity.
