- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks authorization checks for certain functions, allowing unauthenticated users to access sensitive order data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control, specifically missing authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated users can access order details, including customer names, full addresses, phone numbers, and tracking information. This data can be retrieved through a tracking URL provided by the plugin. Attackers could also access the order printing tag URL.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to `/wp-content/plugins/tipsacarrier/js/consulta_datos.php` with specific parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no authentication and must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
