Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-25061

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `wp-booking-system` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `s` parameter, used for search functionality on the wpbs-calendars and wpbs-forms admin pages, was not properly sanitized before being used in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This occurs because the unsanitized input from the `s` parameter is directly reflected in the HTML output of the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter. When a logged-in administrator visits the crafted URL, the injected script would execute in the administrator's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing the administrator's session cookies.
    - Defacement: Modifying the content of the WordPress site.
    - Privilege escalation: Creating new admin accounts or modifying existing ones.
    - Data theft: Stealing sensitive data from the WordPress database or backend.
    - Redirecting to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript code in the `s` parameter.
- The attacker would need to trick an administrator into clicking the malicious URL to trigger the XSS. This could be done through social engineering, phishing, or by embedding the link on a website or forum.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no special privileges on the target system besides the capability to trick an admin user to click on a link.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the WordPress backend.
- The attacker can be external to the system.

**Technical Details**

The vulnerability is located in `class-list-table-calendars.php` and `class-list-table-forms.php` files of the plugin:
- The vulnerable code is within the `get_views()` method.
- Specifically the `s` GET parameter for searching calendars and forms is not properly sanitized before use.
- The patch replaces `sanitize_text_field` with `esc_attr` to properly escape the parameter, preventing the XSS attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.15 of the `wp-booking-system` plugin.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
- The CVSS score is 4.8 (Medium) with the vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N` which reflects the need for high priviledges, user interaction and that the impact to confidentiality and integrity is low while availability is not affected.
