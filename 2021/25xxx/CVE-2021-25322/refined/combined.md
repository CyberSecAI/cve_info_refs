| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-02-17 14:31:06 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1180875](show_bug.cgi?id=1180875 "RESOLVED FIXED")  We are currently reviewing checked-in scripts and sources in OBS for security issues.  In python-HyperKitty the script hyperkitty-permissions.sh is installed along with the package and is also invoked in the %post section of the HyperKitty-web package.  In particular this script performs recursive ownership changes and ACL settings as root on user controlled directories in /var/lib/hyperkitty/data, /var/log/hyperkitty and /srv/www/webapps/mailman/hyperkitty/static/CACHE.  Since these directories are owned by the hyperkitty and/or hyperkitty-admin users they can stage symlink attacks to pass ownership of arbitrary files in the system to themselves. A compromised hyperkitty or hyperkitty-admin account might therefore be able to perform a local root exploit.  Please perform safe operations here. For example:  - only perform the changes in ownership if the ownership does *not* match i.e.   don't do it unconditionally. - pass ownership of the root directory last. - pass switches like -P to setfacl and -h to chown to make it not follow   symbolic links. - using `setpriv` or `su` to drop privileges to the owner of the root of the   directory tree.  If this script is SUSE specific then we will have to assign a SUSE CVE for this issue. Otherwise please tell us who upstream is. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c1)  Andreas Schneider   2021-02-17 15:11:58 UTC  ``` The script is SUSE-specific. IIRC correctly the same script is in postorius.   I wont be able to look into this before next week. If someone else wants to do it feel free to take over. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-02-18 09:24:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to asn@cryptomilk.org from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c1)) > The script is SUSE-specific.

That would have been the next package I would have inspected, because we work in alphabetical order and it comes right after python-HyperKitty ;-). I will open a separate bug for that right away. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c3)  Marcus Rückert   2021-02-23 14:03:57 UTC  ``` ~ » sudo podman images REPOSITORY                                                         TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/leap                                latest  95dab51edb8c  39 hours ago  108 MB  ~ » sudo podman run -ti --rm 95dab51edb8c bash 0ac89398f97a:/ # zypper in util-linux Retrieving repository 'Non-OSS Repository' metadata ......................................................................................................[done] Building repository 'Non-OSS Repository' cache ...........................................................................................................[done] Retrieving repository 'Main Repository' metadata .........................................................................................................[done] Building repository 'Main Repository' cache ..............................................................................................................[done] Retrieving repository 'Main Update Repository' metadata ..................................................................................................[done] Building repository 'Main Update Repository' cache .......................................................................................................[done] Retrieving repository 'Update Repository (Non-Oss)' metadata .............................................................................................[done] Building repository 'Update Repository (Non-Oss)' cache ..................................................................................................[done] Loading repository data...

But this does not take into account any possible race conditions that might occur while the recursive operation is taking place.  Even then most standard utilities use safe system call sequences these days that should prevent any damage from happening when a local user tries to exploit race conditions.  Because this is a complex area on both, the kernel and the userspace end, it is best *not* to rely on this operation being safe. Also changing some seemingly minor aspect of the environment (e.g. the target path listed on the command line) can quickly change the situation again, so it is error prone.  > 0ac89398f97a:/ # cd /home/foo/ [...] > 0ac89398f97a:/home/foo # touch file1; ln -s file1 link1; chown foo^Cink1; ls -lh file1 > 0ac89398f97a:/home/foo # chown foo link1  [...] > 0ac89398f97a:/home/foo # ls -lh file1 > -rw-r--r-- 1 foo root 0 Feb 23 13:58 file1 > 0ac89398f97a:/home/foo # ls -ld link1 > lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 5 Feb 23 13:58 link1 -> file1 > 0ac89398f97a:/home/foo #   Here the "exploit" worked. For the link explicitly listed on the command line `chown` followed the symlink and changed the ownership of "file1" to foo:root. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-02-25 09:20:52 UTC  ``` Since there seems to be some unclarity how to reproduce this I am posting a simple reproducer for a Tumbleweed live system:  1) install the involved packages      root# zypper in HyperKitty-web python3-HyperKitty  2) become the hyperkitty-admin user and emulate an attacker:      root# sudo -u hyperkitty-admin /bin/bash     hyperkitty-admin$ cd /var/lib/hyperkitty/data     hyperkitty-admin$ ls -lh      total 480K      -rw-rw----+ 1 hyperkitty hyperkitty 480K 25. Feb 09:59 hyperkitty.db     hyperkitty-admin$ rm hyperkitty.db     hyperkitty-admin$ ln -s /etc/shadow hyperkitty.db     hyperkitty-admin$ ls -lh . /etc/shadow     -rw-r-----  1 root       shadow     1.2K 25. Feb 09:58 /etc/shadow      .:     total 0     lrwxrwxrwx 1 hyperkitty hyperkitty 11 25. Feb 10:03 hyperkitty.db -> /etc/shadow  3) as root run the fix-permissions script (this would also happen during any    RPM installation/update of the hyperkitty package):      root# /usr/sbin/hyperkitty-fix-permissions  4) as hyperkitty-admin from step 2) inspect the results:      hyperkitty-admin$ ls -lh . /etc/shadow     -rw-rw----  1 hyperkitty hyperkitty 1.2K 25. Feb 09:58 /etc/shadow      .:     total 0     lrwxrwxrwx 1 hyperkitty hyperkitty 11 25. Feb 10:03 hyperkitty.db -> /etc/shadow  So for the hyperkitty-admin we have a pretty simple local root exploit. Basically the hyperkitty user can do the same. However, hyperkitty is not allowed to enter /var/lib/hyperkitty, because of these two lines:      chown   hyperkitty-admin:hyperkitty-admin          ${LIB_DIR}     chmod   u=rwX,g=rwX,o=                             ${LIB_DIR}  I am not sure if this makes sense at all, to deny hyperkitty access to ${LIB_DIR} but pass ownership ${LIB_DIR}/data to hyperkitty. This only makes sense if hyperkitty has access to the sub-directory via a chroot or something similar. If this is the case, then the hyperkitty user can stage the same attack as described above (although it would still need to escape from the chroot to make use of the results). ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-04-01 11:17:47 UTC  ``` Is there any progress here?

That bug was about a functionality issue, this bug here is about a security issue involved with the hyperkitty-permissions.sh script checked in into the package. This script is attempting to "repair" or enforce certain permissions, and this logic is causing security issues.  It would help to remove the script, of course, but we need an active maintainer to take responsibility for such a choice. Security cannot take over this duty, we can just advise and review. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c12)  Andreas Schneider   2021-05-19 16:24:28 UTC  ``` The right thing to do would be to generate the static files during the rpm build process and the script should if needed just fix the permissions to the sqlite database.

You are still packaging the hyperkitty-permissions.sh script. So this is intended for end users to invoke?  There are still missing switches to avoid following symlinks e.g. `-h` for chown. For operations on files below non-root owned directories a privilege drop to the target user needs to happen to make it fool proof. E.g.:      # make sure execution aborts if anything goes wrong in-between     set -e      # first make sure the root directory ownership is correct     chown -h hyperkitty-admin ${LIB_DIR}      # now do the same for DATA_DIR sub-dir which is owned by a different user     chown -h hyperkitty ${DATA_DIR}      # perform chmod only as the unprivileged user, because chmod always     # follows symlinks found in command line arguments     setpriv --ruid hyperkitty --rgid hyperkitty --init-groups --reset-env chmod u=rwX,g=rwX,o= ${DATA_DIR} ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c18)  Andreas Schneider   2021-05-26 08:36:52 UTC  ``` The thing is that you can run certain commands to manage the install. E.g. to create the first database (sqlite by default) and do upgrades of the database. It might be possible to get rid of the hyperkitty-admin user, but then we still need the permission script to fix permissions on files.  Also this needs to be tested and I'm testing this on a production system right now.  Also my time is limited, more eyes would help to look into this. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c19)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-05-26 13:10:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to asn@cryptomilk.org from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c18)) > The thing is that you can run certain commands to manage the install.

My remarks are not about getting rid of the hyperkitty-admin user, they are about performing dangerous operations in a safe way.  Why do permissions have to be "fixed"? I don't fully get that.  When the script makes sure that no service is currently running and already working on these files (i.e. CWD set to somewhere below /var/lib/hyperkitty) then an approach could also be to deny access to the the root directory:      chown root:root /var/lib/hyperkitty     chmod 700 /var/lib/hyperkitty          # now perform all the "fix" operations below /var/lib/hyperkitty      # turn ownership of the root back to the desired values     chown hyperkitty:hyperkitty /var/lib/hyperkitty     chmod 755 /var/lib/hyperkitty ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1182373#c20)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-06-22 11:53:00 UTC  ``` The permissions.sh script has been completely removed from Factory and is also not present in the Leap:15.2 codestream. This bug can be closed. ``` |  |
