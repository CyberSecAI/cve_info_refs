### Relevant Content:

Based on the provided information, CVE-2021-25993 is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in "wiki.js" versions 2.0.0-beta.147 to 2.5.255.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of SVG files uploaded as assets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript can be embedded within an SVG file and uploaded to the application.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize SVG files to remove or neutralize potentially harmful scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** If a victim (e.g., an administrator) views a page containing the malicious SVG, the embedded JavaScript executes. This script can send the victim's JWT tokens to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use these tokens to take over the victim's account.
*   **Confidentiality and Integrity:** The attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and perform actions within the application using the compromised account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** An attacker with low-level privileges (e.g., an editor) can upload a malicious SVG file via the "insert assets" functionality in the page editor.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a victim to access a page where the malicious SVG file is displayed, triggering the execution of the embedded JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privileged Account:** An attacker needs an account with editor privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the wiki.js application to upload malicious SVG files and also needs to host the xss.js file on a server accessible to the victim.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered when an SVG file containing a `<script>` tag with a malicious `href` attribute (e.g., pointing to the attacker's server) is uploaded and subsequently viewed by another user.
*   The malicious script can extract the user's cookies, which contain the JWT tokens necessary for authentication.
*   The fix involves sanitizing SVG files using a library such as `DOMPurify` before they are rendered by the application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the way the application handles SVG uploads.
*   The fix was implemented by adding a sanitization step when processing SVG uploads, and a new `uploadScanSVG` configuration option to enable/disable it.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).

**Affected Versions:** 2.0.0-beta.147 to 2.5.255

**Fixed Version:** 2.5.260 or later
