- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization and CSRF checks in the `add_calendar_event` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization and CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users with subscriber privileges can create events, which they normally shouldn't be able to do.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `add_calendar_event` action, including necessary parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user with at least subscriber privileges.
