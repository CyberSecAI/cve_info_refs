- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize the `sbp_convert_table_name` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification or deletion of data, or complete compromise of the database.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a malicious `sbp_convert_table_name` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator, and have knowledge of the nonce which is required to carry out the request. The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
