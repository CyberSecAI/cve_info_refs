Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Tutor LMS WordPress plugin fails to properly escape the `search` parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute on an admin page. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This occurs because the user-supplied `search` parameter is directly embedded into the HTML output without proper encoding, allowing for execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session when the vulnerable admin page is accessed, and if the crafted URL is used.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Through XSS, the attacker could steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or perform administrative actions.
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other unwanted activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attack is launched by crafting a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload within the `search` parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim, typically an administrator in this case, is required to click on the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `search` parameter within the Tutor LMS plugin.
*   **Crafted Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to craft a specific URL containing the malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Social Engineering (Likely):** The attacker likely needs to use some form of social engineering to trick a user, typically an administrator of the site, into clicking on the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Fixed in Version 1.9.12:** The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.9.12 of the Tutor LMS plugin.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5 (High), reflecting the potential severity of the impact.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided PoC demonstrates the XSS vulnerability by injecting an animation style attribute with an `onanimationstart` event that executes an alert.

**In Summary:**

CVE-2021-25017 is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the Tutor LMS plugin. The root cause is improper sanitization of the `search` parameter in admin page output, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution when a malicious URL is accessed by a user. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.9.12.
