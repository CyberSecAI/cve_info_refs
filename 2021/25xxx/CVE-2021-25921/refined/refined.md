{
  "CVE-2021-25921": {
    "Description": "In OpenEMR, versions 2.7.3-rc1 to 6.0.0 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) due to user input not being validated properly in the `Allergies` section. An attacker could lure an admin to enter a malicious payload and by that initiate the exploit.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper validation of user input in the Allergies section, specifically the 'Title' field of patient details, leading to stored XSS.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application. These scripts would execute when an admin views the patient details in the reports page, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to lure an administrator to enter a malicious payload into the 'Title' field of the Allergies section for a patient. The XSS payload is then triggered when the patient's details are displayed in a report.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the capability to create a new patient and edit the allergies details of that patient using an administrator account.  They need to log in to OpenEMR as an administrator and create a new patient. Then, they must edit the Allergies section and add a malicious payload in the title field of the allergies details."
