  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2021-25985",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly invalidate user sessions after logout and stores them in the browser's local storage without an expiration time.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient session expiration",
         "Storing session tokens in local storage without expiration"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can use a previously used or available session token to take over an account and login as a legitimate user.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Stealing session tokens from local storage after user logout",
        "Exploiting an XSS vulnerability to steal session tokens from local storage"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to either have access to a previously used session token or be able to execute arbitrary javascript in the user's browser (e.g. via XSS).",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because user sessions are stored in local storage, which by default does not have an expiration time, and the application does not properly invalidate these sessions upon logout. A proof of concept is provided demonstrating how to log back in after logout by pasting the token back into localStorage. Additionally, the provided XSS PoC allows an attacker to log the user's token into the browser console."
