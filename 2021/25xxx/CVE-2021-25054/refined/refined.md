Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin does not sanitize user input into the 'did' parameter and uses it directly in a SQL statement.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Authenticated SQL Injection.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive information, depending on the privileges of the database user.
Attack vectors: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable plugin's admin page with a malicious payload in the 'did' parameter.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable admin page and exploit the vulnerability.
