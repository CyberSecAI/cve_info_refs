{
  "CVE-2021-25973": {
    "Description": "In Publify, 9.0.0.pre1 to 9.2.4 are vulnerable to Improper Access Control. “guest” role users can self-register even when the admin does not allow it. This happens due to front-end restriction only.",
    "Root cause": "The application only implements the restriction of user self-registration in the front-end, allowing bypassing by directly accessing the signup URL.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper Access Control",
        "Improper Authorization",
        "Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres"
      ],
    "Impact": "An unauthorized user can create an account with “guest” privileges, even when the administrator has disabled self-registration.",
    "Attack vector": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the signup URL."
  }
}
