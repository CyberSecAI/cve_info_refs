    "Impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the HTTP Host header, potentially redirecting application flow to an external or unexpected host, leading to phishing or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack",
      "Manipulation of HTTP Host header"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept and modify HTTP traffic",
