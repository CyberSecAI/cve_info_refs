- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape category parameters when adding a new category, leading to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in category parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of any admin user who views the category page, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with malicious JavaScript code embedded in the category parameters (`mec_cat_color`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user (even a subscriber) on the vulnerable WordPress site.
