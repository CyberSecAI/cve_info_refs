Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

* **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw present in the `feedback_process.php` file of the E-Commerce Website application. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it and later displaying it.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored XSS Vulnerability. The application accepts user input in the feedback form and stores it directly into a database or file. Subsequently, when this stored data is displayed on the website, the malicious script within the feedback executes in the browser of anyone who views it.

* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the feedback section of the website. When other users view the feedback, these scripts will be executed within their browsers. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    * Stealing user session cookies.
    * Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    * Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
    * Defacing the website
    * Potentially gaining access to user accounts.

* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the feedback form provided by the application. An attacker inputs malicious Javascript into the feedback form, which is then stored in the database. The stored XSS is triggered when the application displays the attacker controlled feedback.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to access and submit feedback through the website's feedback form.
    * No elevated privileges or special network access is required.
    * The attacker only needs to be able to submit malicious input to the feedback section of the application.
