PMPro Update 2.6.7: Security Release
# PMPro Update 2.6.7: Security Release

 Estimated reading time: 2 minutes

[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/pmpro-update-2-6-7-security-release/&text=PMPro%20Update%202.6.7%3A%20Security%20Release "Share on Twitter")[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/pmpro-update-2-6-7-security-release/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button "Share on Facebook")[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/pmpro-update-2-6-7-security-release/ "Share on LinkedIn")

Version 2.6.7 of Paid Memberships Pro is out with a single security fix. All users are advised to update as soon as possible.

Thanks to [WPScan.com](https://wpscan.com/) for the responsible disclosure of this vulnerability.

The fix in version 2.6.7 prevents against SQL injections that could be used in “distributed denial of service” (ddos) attacks. The vulnerability could also potentially be used by savvy attackers to get sensitive information from your WordPress database not meant to be public.

![Development Changelog for Paid Memberships Pro Release Updates](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pmpro-development-release-notes-blog-default-1024x576.jpg)

You can update Paid Memberships Pro from the plugins page of your WordPress dashboard or get the [latest version of PMPro here](/documentation/download/).

If you need to manually patch your copy of PMPro, the fix is to edit the `pmpro_getLevelAtCheckout` function in the `includes/functions.php` file and make sure that the `$discount_code` and `$level_id` variables used in the SQL queries are wrapped with the `esc_sql` function. There are 3 lines to edit. Further updates are coming out soon with more comprehensive edits, but these are the important ones to patch immediately.

If you have any questions or need help with this, [please reach out to us for support](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/support/).

## The full list of updates is below:

* **SECURITY:** Updated escaping in the pmpro\_getLevelAtCheckout and pmpro\_checkDiscountCode functions as extra precaution against SQL injections. (Thanks, WPScan)
