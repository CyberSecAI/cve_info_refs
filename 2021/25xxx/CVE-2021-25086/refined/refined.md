- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some input before outputting it on an admin dashboard page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browser of an administrator viewing the affected page. This can lead to actions being performed on behalf of the administrator or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject the malicious script through the `Referer` header when accessing any page on the affected website. The injected script will be stored in the database, and triggered when an administrator views the detailed report page for the affected article.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the affected website. No authentication is required. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
