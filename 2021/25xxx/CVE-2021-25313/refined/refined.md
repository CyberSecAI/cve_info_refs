**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the Rancher API not properly escaping user input in the URL when accessed through a browser.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

      - Other malicious actions within the user's browser.

**5. Attack vectors:**

   - An attacker would need to trick a victim into clicking on a malicious link to trigger the vulnerability.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs.
