Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25096:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing check that allowed bypassing the plugin's country-based blocking mechanism. Specifically, the plugin did not properly handle requests that included the `admin-ajax` parameter in the URL, which is a WordPress AJAX handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Ban Bypass:** The core vulnerability is the ability to bypass the IP2Location Country Blocker's restrictions by using a specific URL parameter, `admin-ajax`.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The changeset message "Fixed security issues with CSRF" and code changes indicates that the plugin's AJAX functionality was vulnerable to CSRF. Although not directly mentioned in the description, the fix included adding nonce validation and permission checks for admin actions.
- **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugin initially failed to properly restrict access to its AJAX endpoints, allowing unauthorized users to potentially trigger actions meant only for administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Bypass of Blocking:** An attacker could completely circumvent the country-based blocking feature, accessing the website regardless of their geographic location. This defeats the plugin's core purpose, allowing access from blocked countries.
- **CSRF leading to actions on behalf of admin user:** While the original vulnerability is a bypass, the changes to the plugin included CSRF protection which indicates the actions triggered by the AJAX calls could be performed by an attacker via CSRF. This would allow attackers to take administrative actions on the site, if they could trick an admin user into clicking a malicious link.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker could directly craft a URL with the `admin-ajax` parameter (e.g., `https://example.com/?admin-ajax=hehe`) to bypass the block.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Prior Access:** The attacker did not need any prior access or authenticated privileges to exploit the vulnerability to bypass the country blocking mechanism. The attacker only needs to know a specific parameter to include in a URL to bypass the country restrictions. The CSRF vulnerability does require the attacker to trick an admin into visiting a malicious link, but that does not require authenticated access to the WordPress system prior to the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix implemented in version 2.26.5 addresses both the bypass and the CSRF vulnerability by adding permission checks and proper handling of internal XHR and cron calls.
- The provided patch diff shows the changes to ignore various AJAX requests and to introduce capability checks for administrative actions, thus preventing the bypass.
