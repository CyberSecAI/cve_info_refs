**CVE-2021-25465: Improper scheme check in Samsung Themes**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improper scheme check within the Samsung Themes application.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application fails to properly validate the scheme of URLs or intents, which are used to trigger actions or navigate the app. This lack of validation allows attackers to manipulate these schemes and control the app's behavior.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can perform a Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. This allows them to intercept and potentially modify communication between the Samsung Themes app and its server, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs or intents with manipulated schemes. The attacker can then deliver these malicious links to the victim, potentially through phishing or other methods.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept the communication between the Samsung Themes application and the server.
    *   The attacker also needs the capability to craft and deliver malicious URLs or intents to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is categorized as low severity.
* The affected version is Samsung Themes prior to version 5.2.01.
* The vulnerability was reported on May 31, 2021.
