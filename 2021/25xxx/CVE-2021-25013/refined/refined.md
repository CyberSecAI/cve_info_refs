  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not have authorization and CSRF check on the `qubely_delete_saved_block` AJAX action, and does not ensure that the block to be deleted belongs to the plugin.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Missing authorization check",
    "Missing CSRF check"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Any authenticated user, including subscribers, can delete arbitrary posts.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action `qubely_delete_saved_block` and a `block_id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (even a subscriber is sufficient)."
