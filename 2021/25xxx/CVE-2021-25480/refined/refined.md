Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2021-25480:

**CVE-2021-25480**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of replay attack protection in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message process in Qualcomm modems.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from the modem's failure to properly validate and prevent the reuse of a GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message. This allows an attacker to replay previously sent messages.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to a remote denial of service (DoS) affecting the mobile network connection.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attack involves replaying a GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and replay network traffic related to the mobile connection.
    *   The attacker does not need any special privileges on the device itself, but they would need to be able to perform over-the-air network attacks.
*   **Affected Versions:** O(8.x), P(9.0), Q(10.0), R(11.0) devices with Qualcomm chipsets.
*   **Mitigation:** The patch adds a check to prevent the reuse of GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND messages.
