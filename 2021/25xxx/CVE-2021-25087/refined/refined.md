The provided content relates to CVE-2021-25087.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Download Manager plugin has insufficient authorization checks in some of its REST API endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:**  REST API endpoints lack proper authorization checks.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerabilities lead to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Exposure of plaintext passwords:** Attackers can retrieve plaintext passwords associated with password-protected posts via the `/wp-json/wpdm/search` endpoint.
*   **Bypassing authentication for file downloads:** Attackers can bypass authentication to download arbitrary files by manipulating the `wpdmdl` parameter and using a download key obtained via the `/wp-json/wpdm/validate-password` endpoint.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated access to REST API endpoints:** Attackers do not require authentication to access the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Manipulating REST API parameters:** Attackers can manipulate parameters like `wpdmdl` and `_wpdmkey` to achieve unauthorized file downloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication or user privileges.
*   The attacker needs access to the WordPress site's REST API endpoints.
