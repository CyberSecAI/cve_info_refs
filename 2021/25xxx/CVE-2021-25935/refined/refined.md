{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `add()` function in the `opennms` module performs insufficient input validation on the `foreign-source` parameter, allowing an attacker to bypass existing regex validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary scripts into the database. When these scripts are rendered, they can execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted request to the server including the malicious script in the `foreign-source` parameter. This is typically done through a web interface.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have low level privileges and be authenticated to the application in order to access the vulnerable functionality. User interaction is required to trigger the stored XSS."
  },
  "fix": "Upgrade to Horizon 27.1.1, Meridian 2020.1.8 or Meridian 2019.1.19 which include input sanitization using the `_.escape` function to prevent the execution of malicious scripts when displayed in the UI."
