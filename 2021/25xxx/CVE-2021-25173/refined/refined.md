Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2021-25173**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a memory allocation with an excessive size when parsing specially crafted DGN files within the Open Design Alliance (ODA) Drawings SDK.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (CWE-789): The application attempts to allocate a large amount of memory based on the malformed input from the DGN file, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and other issues.
    *   Lack of Proper Validation: The application does not properly validate the data within the DGN file before attempting memory allocation, enabling the excessive allocation.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): The excessive memory allocation can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive due to resource exhaustion.
    *   Potential Code Execution: Although primarily causing DoS, the vulnerability could potentially be leveraged for remote code execution in the context of the current process.
    *   Memory Corruption: The excessive memory allocation may also cause memory corruption leading to undefined behavior.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious DGN File: The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted DGN file with an affected application using the vulnerable ODA Drawings SDK.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local Access: The attacker needs to have a way to get the user to open the malicious file on the target system. This may involve social engineering, phishing, or other delivery methods.
    *   User Interaction: The user needs to interact with the malicious file for the vulnerability to be triggered.
    *   No special privileges are required

**Summary of all CVEs in provided documents:**

The provided documents describe multiple vulnerabilities in the Open Design Alliance (ODA) Drawings SDK, which are leveraged by Siemens COMOS, JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization products. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by opening specially crafted files in different file formats, including DGN, DXF, DWG, BMP, TIFF, CGM, TGA, PCT, HPG, PLT, RAS, PAR and ASM. The vulnerabilities primarily include:

*   Memory allocation with excessive size
*   Out-of-bounds read
*   Out-of-bounds write
*   Use-after-free
*   Type confusion
*   Null pointer dereference
*   Stack-based buffer overflow
*   Improper handling of exceptional conditions
*   Improper Input Validation
*   Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast

These vulnerabilities can lead to:

*   Denial of service (application crash)
*   Remote code execution
*   Information disclosure

The advisory recommends updating to the latest versions of affected products. It also recommends avoiding opening untrusted files from unknown sources to mitigate the risk.
