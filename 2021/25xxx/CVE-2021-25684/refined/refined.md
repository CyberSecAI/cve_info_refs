{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from Apport's handling of FIFO files. When Apport attempts to open a FIFO file, it can get stuck reading from it, causing a delay in the execution of the get_pid_info function. This delay can be exploited to manipulate the process ID (PID) and subsequently inject malicious data into the /proc/pid/status file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Apport gets stuck reading from a FIFO file",
     "The delay caused by a stuck file read allows an attacker to recycle a PID to a SUID process with a crafted name"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation to root. An attacker can create a core file owned by root with attacker controlled content, which can be used to execute arbitrary code as root.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can create a FIFO file with a predictable name in /var/log, then create a new instance of apport causing it to hang on reading the FIFO, delaying the get_pid_info function, recycle a PID to a SUID process with a crafted file name, and then release the first apport instance by writing to the FIFO file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local unprivileged user capable of creating files and running programs."
