  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding an article, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Management column' (Column administrator authority) when creating a new article. When a user views the affected content, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious payload in the `name`, `content` and `slug` parameters during article creation through the `/admin/admin.php` endpoint.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be logged in with appropriate permissions (e.g. admin1). The attacker needs the ability to create or edit content via the application."
