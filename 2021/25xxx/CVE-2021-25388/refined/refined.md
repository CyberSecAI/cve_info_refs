  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-25388",
    "description": "Improper caller check vulnerability in Knox Core prior to SMR MAY-2021 Release 1 allows attackers to install arbitrary app.",
    "affected_versions": "R(11.0)",
    "root_cause": "The Knox Core app, specifically the `DualDARInitService`, improperly validates the caller, allowing an attacker to trigger the installation of an arbitrary app. The vulnerability exists because the service copies a user-supplied URI to a publicly accessible location (`/sdcard/Android/data/com.samsung.android.knox.containercore/files/client_downloaded_knox_app.apk`) and then proceeds with the installation process.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper caller check",
      "Arbitrary app installation",
       "Insecure file storage",
      "Bypass of security checks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can install arbitrary applications on a vulnerable device. This can lead to further compromise such as data theft, malware installation, or device control.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the exported service `com.samsung.android.knox.containercore.provisioning.DualDARInitService`",
      "Passing a crafted URI via the `dualdar-config-client-location` parameter"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to launch an intent targeting the vulnerable service (`com.samsung.android.knox.containercore.provisioning.DualDARInitService`) and provide a malicious URI that points to an application file. No special permissions are required for the attack."
