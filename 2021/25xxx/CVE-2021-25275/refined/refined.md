- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure storage of database credentials in a configuration file with overly permissive access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Database credentials for the SolarWinds Orion backend database are stored in a file (`SWNetPerfMon.DB`) accessible to all locally authenticated users.
    - The database password is encrypted, but the decryption key is easily accessible, allowing decryption with a one-line code.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Attackers can gain complete control over the `SOLARWINDS_ORION` database by connecting to the Microsoft SQL Server using the recovered credentials.
    - This allows for data theft or the addition of a new admin-level user, potentially compromising the SolarWinds Orion platform.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local access or remote access via RDP to a machine running the SolarWinds Orion platform.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Must have local or RDP access with a user account that has permissions to read the vulnerable configuration file.
    - Requires basic knowledge to run the provided decryption code.
