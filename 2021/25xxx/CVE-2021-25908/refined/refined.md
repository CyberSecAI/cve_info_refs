- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `From<EventList>` conversion reads from a container using `ptr::read` and then calls a user-specified `Into<Event>` function. If the user-provided function panics, the read value can be dropped twice, leading to a double-free.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Double-free vulnerability due to unsafe memory handling during the conversion process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A double-free can lead to memory corruption and potentially a denial-of-service. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a user-defined `Into<Event>` function that panics during the `From<EventList>` conversion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges or user interaction are needed. The attacker only needs to supply a function that panics during the `Into<Event>` conversion, which is a standard functionality within the library.
