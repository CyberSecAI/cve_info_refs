### Summary:
This document describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Give WordPress plugin, specifically affecting versions prior to 2.17.3. The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `form_id` parameter within the `give_checkout_login` AJAX action. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request containing JavaScript code within the `form_id` parameter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize the `form_id` parameter before outputting it in the response within the `give_checkout_login` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of sanitization and escaping of user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an unauthenticated request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` set to `give_checkout_login`.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload by injecting JavaScript into the `form_id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the target website's `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to trigger the malicious request.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.7 (Medium).
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.17.3 of the plugin.
- The researcher who discovered and reported the vulnerability is ZhongFu Su(JrXnm) of Wuhan University.
- The provided proof of concept code demonstrates how an unauthenticated user can trigger the XSS vulnerability.
