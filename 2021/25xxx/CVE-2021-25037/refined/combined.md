# Severe Vulnerabilities Fixed in All In One SEO Plugin Version 4.1.5.3

Updated on December 14, 2021 - Marc Montpas

During an internal audit of the [All In One SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/) plugin, we uncovered an SQL Injection vulnerability and a Privilege Escalation bug.

If exploited, the SQL Injection vulnerability could grant attackers access to privileged information from the affected site’s database (e.g., usernames and hashed passwords).

The Privilege Escalation bug we discovered may grant bad actors access to protected REST API endpoints they shouldn’t have access to. This could ultimately enable users with low-privileged accounts, like subscribers, to perform remote code execution on affected sites.

We reported the vulnerabilities to the plugin’s author via email, and they recently released version 4.1.5.3 to address them. We strongly recommend that you update to the latest plugin version and have an established security solution on your site, such as [Jetpack Security](https://jetpack.com/features/security/).

## Details

Plugin Name: All In One SEO
Plugin URI: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/>
Author: <https://aioseo.com/>

## The Vulnerabilities

### Authenticated Privilege Escalation

**Affected versions:** Every version between 4.0.0 and 4.1.5.2 inclusively.
**CVE-ID:** CVE-2021-25036
**CVSSv3.1:** [9.9](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
**CWSS:** [92.1](https://www.cwss-score.info/#TI:C,1/AP:P,0.9/AL:NA,1/IC:NA,1.0/FC:T,1/RP:RU,0.7/RL:NA,1/AV:I,1/AS:NA,1/IN:A,1/SC:A,1/BI:C,1/DI:NA,1/EX:H,1/EC:NA,1/P:NA,1/)

```

	/**
	 * Validates access from the routes array.
	 *
	 * @since 4.0.0
	 *
	 * @param  \WP_REST_Request $request The REST Request.
	 * @return bool                      True if validated, false if not.
	 */
	public function validateAccess( $request ) {
		$route     = str_replace( '/' . $this->namespace . '/', '', $request->get_route() );
		$routeData = isset( $this->getRoutes()[ $request->get_method() ][ $route ] ) ? $this->getRoutes()[ $request->get_method() ][ $route ] : [];

		// No direct route name, let's try the regexes.
		if ( empty( $routeData ) ) {
			foreach ( $this->getRoutes()[ $request->get_method() ] as $routeRegex => $routeInfo ) {
				$routeRegex = str_replace( '@', '\@', $routeRegex );
				if ( preg_match( "@{$routeRegex}@", $route ) ) {
					$routeData = $routeInfo;
					break;
				}
			}
		}

		if ( empty( $routeData['access'] ) ) {
			return true;
		}

		// We validate with any of the access options.
		if ( ! is_array( $routeData['access'] ) ) {
			$routeData['access'] = [ $routeData['access'] ];
		}
		foreach ( $routeData['access'] as $access ) {
			if ( current_user_can( $access ) ) {
				return true;
			}
		}

		if ( current_user_can( apply_filters( 'aioseo_manage_seo', 'aioseo_manage_seo' ) ) ) {
			return true;
		}

		return false;
	}

```

The privilege checks applied by All In One SEO to secure REST API endpoints contained a very subtle bug that could’ve granted users with low-privileged accounts (like subscribers) access to every single endpoint the plugin registers.

The Api::validateAccess() method relies on the REST API route being requested to know which privilege checks to enforce on a given request. Since it didn’t account for the fact that WordPress treats REST API routes as [case-insensitive strings](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/rest-api/class-wp-rest-server.php#L1019), changing a single character to uppercase would completely bypass the privilege checks routine.

This is particularly worrying because some of the plugin’s endpoints are pretty sensitive. For example, the `aioseo/v1/htaccess` endpoint can rewrite a site’s .htaccess with arbitrary content. An attacker could abuse this feature to hide [.htaccess backdoors](https://github.com/wireghoul/htshells) and execute malicious code on the server.
