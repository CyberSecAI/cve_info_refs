- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's `dilaz_mb_query_select` AJAX action allows logged-in users to query user data. This action does not properly restrict access to sensitive user information, specifically email addresses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The plugin exposes user email addresses to any logged-in user, including those with low-level privileges such as "subscriber".
    - **Insufficient Access Control:** The AJAX endpoint lacks proper access control, allowing users with minimal privileges to query sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker (or any logged-in user) can extract email addresses of other users on the WordPress site. This can be used for targeted phishing attacks, spam campaigns, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `dilaz_mb_query_select`, `query_type` set to `user` and `q` parameter containing a portion of the desired email address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be a logged-in user on the affected WordPress site. Any role, including "subscriber", is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
