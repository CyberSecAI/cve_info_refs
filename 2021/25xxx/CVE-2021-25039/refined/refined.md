- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `wmcc_content_type`, `wmcc_source_blog`, and `wmcc_record_per_page` parameters before outputting them in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user submits a crafted POST request to the plugin's admin page (`/wp-admin/network/admin.php?page=wordpress-multisite-content-copier`) containing malicious code in the vulnerable parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious POST request and trick a user into submitting it, or find a way to inject it. No authentication is required for exploitation.
