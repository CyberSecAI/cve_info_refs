- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Aruba Instant Access Point (IAP).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow (CWE-120), caused by a buffer copy without checking the size of the input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of the system, including confidentiality, integrity and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can exploit this vulnerability remotely with no user interaction required (UI:N).
