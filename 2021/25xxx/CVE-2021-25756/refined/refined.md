Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2021-25756:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of HTTP links for several remote repositories within IntelliJ IDEA.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Insecure communication protocol. By using HTTP, the communication between the IDE and remote repositories is unencrypted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could intercept the communication and potentially gain access to sensitive information. The specific data exposed isn't detailed but it is implied to be related to repositories.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks. An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between IntelliJ IDEA and the remote repositories. This could be achieved through man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the user's IntelliJ IDEA instance and the remote repositories it communicates with.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept and potentially manipulate network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text doesn't give extensive technical detail beyond the general description of the vulnerability.
- It only specifies that multiple remote repositories were using HTTP, not precisely what data was being transmitted or what type of repositories are involved.
- The issue was resolved in version 2020.2 of IntelliJ IDEA, meaning that subsequent versions should not be vulnerable.
