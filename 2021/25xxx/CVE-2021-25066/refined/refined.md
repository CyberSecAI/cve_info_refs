- Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some imported data.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- Attack vectors: By importing a crafted JSON file containing XSS payloads within form titles via the plugin's import/export functionality.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be a high privilege user (Admin+) and be able to import form data via the plugin's import functionality.
