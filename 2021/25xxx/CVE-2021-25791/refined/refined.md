Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25791:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Online Doctor Appointment System" application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided input when updating the profile of a doctor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application stores unsanitized user input in the database, which is later rendered in the web application without proper encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web application. This code can be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking: An attacker can steal user session cookies and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
    - Data theft: An attacker can steal sensitive information such as personal data, passwords, etc., from users logged into the web application.
    - Defacement: An attacker can modify or deface the content of the web application.
    - Phishing attacks: An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites or display phishing forms to steal login credentials.
    - Further attacks: An attacker can use the XSS vulnerability to launch other attacks against the users.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the user profile update feature of the application. An attacker with a doctor's account can inject malicious JavaScript code into the following fields:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Address

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the following:
    - A valid doctor's account to login to the application
    - The ability to access the profile update page

**More Details:**
- The exploit is triggered when a doctor updates their profile with malicious JavaScript code in the mentioned fields, which is then stored in the database.
- The payload is triggered each time the profile is viewed or a new page is visited after the malicious update.
- The specific vulnerable application is "Online Doctor Appointment System 1.0" which can be found at `https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14663/online-doctor-appointment-system-php-full-source-code.html`.
