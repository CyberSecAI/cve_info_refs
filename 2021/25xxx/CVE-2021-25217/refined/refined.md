      "root_cause": "A discrepancy exists between the code that handles encapsulated option information in DHCP leases transmitted 'on the wire' and the code that reads and parses lease information after it has been written to disk storage. Specifically, the `parse_X` function, used for parsing DHCP lease options with the 'X' format, has a flawed length check when processing colon-separated hex values, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow. This function is used in multiple places for parsing DHCP options in both dhcpd and dhclient, for config and lease files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
         "Improper input validation"

      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious DHCP lease or configuration file containing option information with colon-separated hex values that when parsed, would trigger a stack-based buffer overflow.",

      "relates_to_cve": true,
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability resides in ISC DHCP's code for parsing DHCP lease options, specifically when handling colon-separated hexadecimal digits in 'X' format options. There's a discrepancy between how these options are handled 'on the wire' and how they're read from disk, which leads to a stack-based buffer overflow due to an incorrect length check in the `parse_X` function.",

        "root_cause": "A buffer overflow exists within the ISC DHCP client and server software when parsing lease information containing certain options. This is due to a discrepancy in how encapsulated option information is handled when received 'on the wire' and when read/parsed from disk, specifically when processing colon-separated hexadecimal digits values. The vulnerable `parse_X` function, when processing hex values, uses an incorrect logic for checking buffer length.",
