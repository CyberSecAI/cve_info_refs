Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-25080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the IP address obtained from HTTP headers such as `CLIENT-IP` and `X-FORWARDED-FOR`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The unsanitized IP address, which could contain malicious JavaScript code, is stored in the database and displayed to administrators when viewing contact form entries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser when they view a contact form entry. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking: Stealing the administrator's session cookie, granting attacker full control of the website.
    *   Malicious actions: Performing administrative actions such as creating new admin users, modifying content, or installing malicious plugins.
    *   Redirects: Redirecting administrators to attacker-controlled websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can inject a malicious script into the `CLIENT-IP` or `X-FORWARDED-FOR` headers when submitting a contact form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs to be able to submit a contact form on a website using the vulnerable plugin, modifying headers in the process.
*   The administrator needs to view the created contact form entry.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is present in versions of the "Contact Form Entries" plugin prior to 1.1.7.
* The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using the `CLIENT-IP` header and a Contact Form 7 submission.
* The fix in version 1.1.7 involves sanitizing the IP address before it is stored. The code changes show the introduction of `vxcf_form::clean()` function for cleaning the IP, URL, browser name and OS information.
