**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2021-25977. It includes a detailed description of the vulnerability, its root cause, affected versions, and remediation advice, specifically from Mend's vulnerability database.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The root cause is improper sanitization of the page title input in PiranhaCMS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code that is later executed by the application.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: A low-privileged user can execute arbitrary JavaScript by creating a page with a crafted title. This can lead to various malicious actions, potentially compromising the application and/or user sessions.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is through the web interface of PiranhaCMS. Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited by creating a page with a malicious script in the page title field.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with the capability to create pages in the PiranhaCMS system.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** PiranhaCMS versions 7.0.0 to 9.1.1 are affected.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC code demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting `<img src=x onerror=alert(‘XSS’)>` into the page title.
*  **Mitigation**: The suggested fix is to upgrade to PiranhaCMS version 9.2.0 or higher, where the input sanitization issue is resolved.
*  **CVSS Scores:**
    *   **CVSS v3.1**: Base score of 5.4 with the following metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
    *   **CVSS v2**: Base score of 3.5 with the following metrics: AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:N/I:P/A:N

**4. Additional Notes:**
* The provided information comes from the Mend.io vulnerability database, which also links to the original commit that fixed the vulnerability. This indicates that the identified issue is accurately described and corrected.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted page title is rendered, which shows that the XSS is stored and not just reflected.

In summary, CVE-2021-25977 is a stored XSS vulnerability in PiranhaCMS versions 7.0.0 to 9.1.1, caused by inadequate sanitization of page titles. This allows low-privileged users to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript, which is mitigated by upgrading to version 9.2.0.
