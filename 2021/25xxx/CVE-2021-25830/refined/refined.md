    {
      "source": "github.com_991363ed_20250114_204038.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `UniFill::fromPPTY` function within the `UniFill.cpp` file. This function processes binary data related to fill properties in a PPTX file. Specifically, when handling `FILL_TYPE_BLIP` (picture fill) data, it reads a base64-encoded image string, decodes it, saves it to a temporary file, and then adds a relationship to that image in the PPTX file structure. The issue arises because the code does not properly handle or sanitize the data URI, potentially leading to arbitrary file creation and directory traversal vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of data URIs",
        "Potential for arbitrary file creation and directory traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially create files in arbitrary locations on the server. If the server runs with elevated privileges the attacker may take full control of the target system. This could also lead to denial-of-service or other attacks due to the server attempting to write to restricted areas.",

          "root_cause": "The code within `BinaryFileReaderWriter.cpp` contains functions to handle image processing and file creation. Specifically, the functions `CImageManager2::GenerateImage`, `CImageManager2::GenerateImageExec`, and `CImageManager2::WriteOleData` directly interact with the file system when dealing with base64-encoded data, and OLE objects. The lack of proper validation and sanitization of paths and filenames allows for potential directory traversal, arbitrary file creation, and overwriting existing files. When processing base64 image data, or OLE objects, the code creates files and directories based on data included in the crafted document.",
