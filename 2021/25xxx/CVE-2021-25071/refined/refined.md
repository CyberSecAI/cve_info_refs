- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `translation` parameter before outputting it on an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin page. If a victim (admin) clicks on the crafted link, the injected script will execute, potentially leading to various malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable `translation` parameter, then tricking a victim (admin) into clicking the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious link and social-engineer the victim into clicking it. The victim needs to be an authenticated user.
