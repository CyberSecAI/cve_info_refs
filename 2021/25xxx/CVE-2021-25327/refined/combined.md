Title:- Authenticated XSRF in RN510 Mesh Extender.
CVE-ID :- Requested
Author: Kaustubh G. Padwad
Vendor: Shenzhen Skyworth Digital Technology Company Ltd.(http://www.skyworthdigital.com/products)
Products:
1. RN510 with firmware V.3.1.0.4 (Tested and verified)

2.RN620 with respective firmware or below
3.RN410 With Respective firmwware or below.
Severity: High--Critical
Advisory ID
============
KSA-Dev-0011
About the Product:
==================
\* RN510 dual-band wireless AC2100 access point delivers high-speed access for web surfing and HD video streamings. Integrated with two gigabit LAN ports, and a dual-band AP which supports 2x2 802.11n(300Mbps) and 4x4 802.11ac (1733Mbps) concurrently, RN510provides a stable & reliable high speed wired and wireless connectivity for home user and SOHO users. Utilizing state of art EasyMesh solution, two or more RN510 units could be easily teamed upwith Skyworth ONT gateway (e.g. GN543) and form an automatically organized network. RN510 could support either wired line backhaul or wireless backhaul to other mesh node. User could enjoy a wonderful zero-touch, robust and failure auto recovery, seamless connected wireless home networking experience.
RN510 uses a system of units to achieve seamless whole-home Wi-Fi coverage, eliminate weak signal areas once and for all. RN510 work together to form a unified network with a single network name. Devices automatically switch between RN510s as you move through your home for the fastest possible speeds. A RN510 Dual-pack delivers Wi-Fi to an area of up to 2,800 square feet. And if that’s not enough, simply add more RN510 to the network anytime to increase coverage. RN510 provides fast and stable connections with speeds of up to 2100 Mbps and works with major internet service provider (ISP) and modem. Parental Controls limits online time and block inappropriate websites according to unique profiles created for each family member. Setup is easier than ever with the Skywifi app there to walk you through every step.
Description:
============
An issue was discovered on Shenzhen Skyworth
The value of DestIPAdderss under /cgi-bin/net-routeadd.asp is not properly sanatizing hence it allow to execute malicious javascript, which result a successful cross site scripting in /cgi-bin/net-routeadd.asp, Additionally value of urlitem under /cgi-bin/sec-urlfilter.asp is also not getting properly sanitize hence it will result to successful cross site scripting.
Since device dont have CSRF valdation it is possible to perform the XSRF by using CSRF + XSS vulnerability.
