Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-25924

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection at the `/go/api/config/backup` endpoint in GoCD.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection on the specified endpoint. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Configuration Changes:** An attacker can manipulate backup configurations, potentially disrupting backup processes.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The `post_backup_script` field can be modified to execute system commands on the server, leading to a compromise of the system.
- **Backup Schedule Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the backup schedule, potentially preventing backups from being performed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link/Website:** The attacker crafts a malicious link or website.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a logged-in user to click on the malicious link/website while the user is authenticated to GoCD.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious request to the vulnerable server.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking on the malicious link/website.
- **No Prior Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any credentials to initiate this attack; the victim's active session is what is being targeted.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** GoCD versions 19.6.0 to 21.1.0 are affected.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in GoCD version 21.2.0.
- **PoC Code:** The provided proof of concept code demonstrates how the CSRF attack works by sending a crafted POST request to the `/go/api/config/backup` endpoint.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 and CVSS v2 base score of 9.3, indicating a high severity.
