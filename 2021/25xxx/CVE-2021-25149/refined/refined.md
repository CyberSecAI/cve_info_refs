- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a buffer copy operation without proper input size checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Classic Buffer Overflow (CWE-120).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the system, allowing for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable service (confidentiality, integrity and availability impact).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with network access can exploit the vulnerability. No prior authentication is needed.
