HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS) provides an array of services for automating
and managing batch workloads and computing resources.

# HTCONDOR-2021-0001 [CVE-2021-25312](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25312)

---

| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| When a user is authenticating to a daemon using IDTOKENS it is possible for them to impersonate other users and/or the "condor" service itself. | |
| | Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | All daemons | 8.9.2 through 8.9.10 (inclusive) | All | Not known to be publicly exploited | 8.9.11 | | Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences | | Verified | Login | Any | Low | High | | Fixed Date | Credit | | 2021-01-27 | Brian Bockleman | | |
| Access Required: | Login |
| An attacker must only be able to authenticate (as any user) to a condor\_schedd process. IDTOKENS is enabled by default; this exploit could be performed by any user who is able to login to the SchedD machine. Any type of authentication can be used including the default methods such as "FS" (on Linux) or NTSSPI (on Windows) | |
| Effort Required: | Low |
| Any user who can authenticate to a condor\_schedd can use command line tools supplied with HTCondor to obtain a valid IDTOKEN. With low effort they could then create a custom tool to connect to the condor\_schedd to impersonate another user or the "condor" service. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | High |
| This allows a user to impersonate any other or the "condor" service. This would allow the user to submit a job as another user on the system, which could potentially run processes as that user and read/write files belonging to that user. By impersonating the "condor" service, the attacker could turn off or potentially reconfigure the HTCondor daemons. | |
| Workaround: |
| If you do not need to use IDTOKENS, you can disable that authentication method by specifying a list of authentication mechanisms that does not include it. On Linux, you would want to set, e.g., (removing any other methods you did not want to use): ``` SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = FS,PASSWORD,SSL,GSI,KERBEROS,MUNGE ```  On Windows, you would want to set, e.g., (removing any other methods you did not want to use): ``` SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = NTSSPI,PASSWORD,SSL,KERBEROS ```  You should also check your configuration for other places you may have explicitly set the list of methods: ``` condor_config_val -dump AUTHENTICATION_METHODS ```  After making any changes, you will need to run ``` condor_reconfig ``` | |
| Full Details: | Embargoed until future notice. |
