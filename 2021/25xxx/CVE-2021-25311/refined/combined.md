HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS) provides an array of services for automating
and managing batch workloads and computing resources.

# HTCONDOR-2021-0002 [CVE-2021-25311](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25311)

---

| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| A running condor\_credd daemon can be instructed to create or write certain files as root that are outside of the directory specified by the parameter "SEC\_CREDENTIAL\_DIRECTORY\_OAUTH". If you have not added the CREDD to your DAEMON\_LIST, you are not vulnerable to this issue. (Keep in mind the CREDD is automatically added to the DAEMON\_LIST if you have added "use feature:OAUTH") | |
| | Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | CredD | 8.9.7 through 8.9.10 (inclusive) | All | Not known to be publicly exploited | 8.9.11 | | Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences | | Verified | Login | Any | Low | High | | Fixed Date | Credit | | 2021-01-27 | Dave DykstraZach Miller | | |
| Access Required: | Login |
| An attacker must only be able to authenticate (as any user) to the condor\_credd process. By default, this can be done by any user who is able to login to the CredD machine. Any type of authentication can be used including the default methods such as "FS" (on Linux) or "NTSSPI" (on Windows) | |
| Effort Required: | Low |
| Any user can use command line tools supplied with HTCondor to convince the CredD to create or overwrite a file owned as root with contents specified by the attacker. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | High |
| The file created by the attacker can be anywhere on the filesystem. The contents of the file can also be supplied by the attacker. The filename of the file created CANNOT be completely specified by the attacker. However, the file could be created in any number of places in /etc such the contents will be executed as root at some point. | |
| Workaround: |
| Do not enable the condor\_credd if you are not depending on it. | |
| Full Details: | Embargoed until future notice. |
