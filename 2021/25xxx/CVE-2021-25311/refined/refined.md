- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `condor_credd` daemon can be instructed to create or write files as root outside of the designated `SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY_OAUTH` directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper file creation/writing permissions and path validation within the `condor_credd` daemon. The daemon allows any authenticated user to write arbitrary content to a file as root. The attacker cannot fully specify the filename, however they can control the path and content of the file which can be created in sensitive locations such as `/etc`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create or overwrite files with attacker-controlled content as root, leading to potential privilege escalation and system compromise by placing files in locations such as `/etc` that can be executed by root.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker needs to authenticate to the `condor_credd` process as any user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any user who can log in to the CredD machine can authenticate to the `condor_credd` process, using methods such as FS on Linux or NTSSPI on Windows. The attacker needs to be able to use HTCondor command line tools.
