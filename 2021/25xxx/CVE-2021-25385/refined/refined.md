**SVE-2021-20184 (CVE-2021-25385): Arbitrary code execution on mediaextractor process**
   - **Severity**: Moderate
   - **Affected versions**: O(8.1), P(9.x), Q(10.0), R(11.0)
   - **Reported on**: January 5, 2021
   - **Disclosure status**: Privately disclosed.
   - **Root cause**: An improper input validation vulnerability in `sdfffd_parse_chunk_PROP()` in `libsdffextractor` library prior to SMR MAY-2021 Release 1
   - **Weakness**: Improper input validation leading to a buffer overflow
   - **Impact**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the mediaextractor process.
   - **Attack vector**: Exploiting a vulnerability in the parsing of a crafted file within the mediaextractor process. This is done by providing a specially crafted file to be processed by the `libsdffextractor` library.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file that is processed by the mediaextractor service. This could be done via various means of file access, such as tricking a user into opening a malicious file or through an already established exploit chain that leads to the execution of the mediaextractor with attacker controlled data.
