{
  "CVE-2021-25410": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `CallBGProvider` provider is declared with the permission `com.samsung.android.callbgprovider.PERMISSION`, which is not properly protected. If `android:protectionLevel` is not specifically set by the developer, it gets defined as `normal` by default. Also the provider is vulnerable to path traversal due to the use of `Uri.getLastPathSegment()` which automatically decodes the value.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure permission setting on `com.samsung.android.callbgprovider.PERMISSION`",
      "Path traversal vulnerability in `CallBGProvider` due to the use of `Uri.getLastPathSegment()`"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files as system (UID 1001) user, allowing access to sensitive information such as the database containing SMS/MMS messages.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious application can access the content provider because the protection level is set to normal.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the device."
