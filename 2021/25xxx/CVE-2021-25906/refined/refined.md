- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from a lack of panic safety when temporarily duplicating objects using `ptr::read()`. If a user-provided function `conversion` panics, the copied objects are dropped twice.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double drop of objects leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory corruption, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a user-provided function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input that triggers the vulnerable code path that copies objects using `ptr::read()` and panics in the conversion function. The attacker doesn't require any privileges or user interaction.
