### Description

Affected versions of this crate did not guard against double drop while temporarily duplicating objects' ownership using `ptr::read()`. Upon panic in a user-provided function `conversion`, objects that are copied by `ptr::read()` are dropped twice, leading to memory corruption.

The flaw was corrected in v0.9.2 by using `ManuallyDrop<T>` to enclose objects that are to be temporarily duplicated.
