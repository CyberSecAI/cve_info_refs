The provided document contains a detailed list of security vulnerabilities addressed in Samsung's monthly security maintenance releases (SMRs) for their mobile devices. While the document does not explicitly describe CVE-2021-25386, it includes a reference to the vulnerability with its corresponding SVE identifier:

**SVE-2021-20185 (CVE-2021-25386): Arbitrary code execution on mediaextractor process**

Based on the provided information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An improper input validation vulnerability exists in the `sdfffd_parse_chunk_FVER()` function within the `libsdffextractor` library.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code within the mediaextractor process.
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the processing of a crafted or malicious media file that triggers the vulnerable code path in the `libsdffextractor` library. This suggests the attack vector involves a malicious media file processed by the media extractor.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to have a malicious media file processed by the affected system. This could be achieved through various methods, including tricking the user into opening the file, using a malicious app, or other attack vectors related to media handling.
