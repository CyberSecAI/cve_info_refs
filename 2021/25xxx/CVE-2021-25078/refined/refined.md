### Root cause of vulnerability
The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the IP address logged by the click tracking feature. Specifically, it was using the raw `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']` and `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` without sanitization.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the plugin logs the IP address from the request headers (`X-Forwarded-For` or `REMOTE_ADDR`) without sanitizing the input before storing it in the database. When an administrator views the click tracking logs, this unsanitized IP is output on the page, allowing for XSS attacks.

### Impact of exploitation
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the IP address field.
- When an administrator views the click tracking page, the malicious JavaScript will execute in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the administrator.

### Attack vectors
- The primary attack vector is through the `X-Forwarded-For` header or `REMOTE_ADDR` field of an HTTP request.
- An unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability by making a request to the website with a crafted `X-Forwarded-For` header containing malicious JavaScript.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the affected website.
- No authentication is required, meaning an attacker can be completely unauthenticated.
