Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of error log content within the WP Photo Album Plus plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input before writing it into the error log.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Because user-controlled input is not sanitized before being written to the error log, a malicious user can inject JavaScript code into the log. This code is then executed when an administrator views the log within the admin panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the administrator's browser session.
- **Full Control of Site:** Depending on the administrator's permissions, the attacker could potentially gain full control of the website, modify content, steal sensitive information, install malicious plugins, redirect users, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated User:** An unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the server, specifically by injecting a malicious payload into the `search-submit` parameter.
- **Error Log Viewing:** An administrator must then view the error log within the plugin's settings page for the injected script to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious payload.
- **No authentication required for initial injection**: No prior authentication is needed to inject the XSS payload into the error log.
- **Admin Interaction:** The attacker needs to rely on an administrator viewing the error log to trigger the XSS, which makes this a stored XSS attack requiring some admin action.

**Additional Details**

- **Affected Plugin:** WP Photo Album Plus versions prior to 8.0.10 are vulnerable.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject the payload using the `search-submit` parameter.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 8.0.10 of the plugin.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as Medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.8.
- **Researcher:** The vulnerability was discovered by Krzysztof ZajÄ…c.
