## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Photo Album Plus < 8.0.10 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin was vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Error log content was handled improperly, therefore any user, even unauthenticated, could cause arbitrary javascript to be executed in the admin panel.

### Proof of Concept

http://127.0.0.1:8001/?search-submit={img%20src%20onerror=alert(1)}
Then the admin neds to browse http://127.0.0.1:8001/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wppa\_options&wppa-tab=miscadv and show the content of error log in the "logging" section.
