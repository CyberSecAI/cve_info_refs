## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# OMGF < 4.5.12 - Admin+ Arbitrary Folder Deletion via Path Traversal

### Description

The plugin does not validate the cache directory setting, allowing high privilege users to use a path traversal vector and delete arbitrary folders when uninstalling the plugin

### Proof of Concept

As admin, put the following payload in the "Fonts Cache Directory" setting of the plugin: ../wp-includes, tick the "Remove settings at Uninstall" setting and uninstall the plugin to delete the wp-includes folder
