- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate the cache directory setting. This allows a high privilege user to inject a path traversal vector into the setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal, Improper Input Validation, Arbitrary folder deletion
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary folders on the server can be deleted when uninstalling the plugin, leading to potential data loss and system instability.
- **Attack vectors**: By modifying the "Fonts Cache Directory" setting with a path traversal payload (e.g., `../wp-includes`) and enabling the "Remove settings at Uninstall" option, then uninstalling the plugin, the attacker triggers the arbitrary folder deletion
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges within the WordPress installation to modify the plugin settings.
