# Booster for WooCommerce < 5.4.9 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in Product XML Feeds Module

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the wcj\_create\_products\_xml\_result parameter before outputting back in the admin dashboard when the Product XML Feeds module is enabled, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue

### Proof of Concept

The "Product XML Feeds" module needs to be enabled in "Woocommerce -> Booster Settings".
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=jetpack&wcj-cat=products&section=products\_xml&wcj\_create\_products\_xml\_result=1<script>alert(%2FXSS%2F)<%2Fscript>
