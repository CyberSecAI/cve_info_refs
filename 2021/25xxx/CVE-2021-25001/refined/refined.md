- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `wcj_create_products_xml_result` parameter before outputting it in the admin dashboard. This occurs when the "Product XML Feeds" module is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin dashboard, potentially leading to actions being performed on behalf of the admin user. The attacker can redirect users to malicious sites, steal cookies, or deface the website
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `wcj_create_products_xml_result` parameter is sent to an admin user, typically through social engineering.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an administrator of the vulnerable WordPress site into clicking on the malicious link. The Product XML Feeds module of the Booster for WooCommerce plugin must also be enabled.
