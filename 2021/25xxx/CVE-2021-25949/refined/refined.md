{
  "guidelines_version": "3",
  "cve_id": "CVE-2021-25949",
  "response": {
    "relevant": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is due to the `setGetter()` function in the 'set-getter' NPM module not validating the object type before assigning the value to a property, leading to prototype pollution. An attacker could inject a `__proto__` property to cause a denial of service or potentially remote code execution.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `setGetter()` function lacks validation on the type of object before assigning a value to a property, allowing an attacker to manipulate the object's prototype.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Prototype Pollution",
          "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes",
          "Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service or potentially achieve remote code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious value to the 'prop' argument of the `setGetter()` function, specifically by including a `__proto__` property within the prop value."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control the input passed to the vulnerable function. The exploit does not require any privilege or user interaction. "
