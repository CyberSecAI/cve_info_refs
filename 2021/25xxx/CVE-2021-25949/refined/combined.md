Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.

History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

Collection: [ArchiveBot: The Archive Team Crowdsourced Crawler](https://archive.org/details/archivebot)

ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).

To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <http://www.archivebot.com>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot>.

# CVE-2021-25949

#### Date: June 10, 2021

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘set-getter’ version 0.1.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module `set-getter` can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function `setGetter()` does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or be able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.
#### PoC Details

The `setGetter()` function accepts `obj, prop, getter` as arguments. Due to the absence of validation on the values passed into the `prop` argument, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the value to include the `\_\_proto\_\_` property. Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `polluted` will be directly assigned to the new object thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `polluted` the value would be substituted as "Yes! It's Polluted" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
var setGetter = require("set-getter")

var obj = {} console.log("Before : " + {}.polluted);

setGetter(obj,'__proto__.polluted', function (polluted) { return 'Yes! Its Polluted' });

console.log("After : " + {}.polluted);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.1.0
#### Prevention

Upgrade to version 0.1.1

#### Language: JS

## An approach to AppSec that helps developer **AND** security teams

Developer and security teams have the same AppSec destination—but they use different routes to get there. And when each team has fundamentally different needs, one tool will not fit all. That’s why we offer different—but complementary—solutions for each team.

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WTW-Slider-Logo2-1-1.png)

Andrei Ungureanu,
Security Architect

[Read case study](https://www.mend.io/customer-success-stories/wtw-uses-mend-to-reduce-mttr/)

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Frame-1707480008.png)

Chris Wallace,
Senior Security Architect

[Read case study](https://www.mend.io/customer-success-stories/vonage/)

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

# set-getter [NPM version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/set-getter) [NPM downloads](https://npmjs.org/package/set-getter) [Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doowb/set-getter)

> Create nested getter properties and any intermediary dot notation (`'a.b.c'`) paths

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
$ npm install set-getter --save
```

## Usage

```
var getter = require('set-getter');
```

set-getter works like [set-value](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/set-value) by adding a property to an object or an object hierarchy using dot notation. The main difference is that the property is added using `Object.defineProperty` and is expected to be a getter function that returns a value.

**Example**

```
var obj = {};

// root level property
getter(obj, 'foo', function() {
  return 'bar';
});
console.log(obj.foo);
//=> 'bar'

// property dot notation
getter(obj, 'bar.baz', function() {
  return 'qux';
});
console.log(obj.bar.baz);
//=> 'qux'

// property array notation
getter(obj, ['beep', 'boop'], function() {
  return 'bop';
});
console.log(obj.beep.boop);
//=> 'bop'
```

## API

### [setGetter](/doowb/set-getter/blob/5bc2750fe1c3db9651d936131be187744111378d/index.js#L27)

Defines a getter function on an object using property path notation.

**Params**

* `obj` **{Object}**: Object to add property to.
* `prop` **{String|Array}**: Property string or array to add.
* `getter` **{Function}**: Getter function to add as a property.

**Example**

```
var obj = {};
getter(obj, 'foo', function() {
  return 'bar';
});
```

> Create nested getter properties and any intermediary dot notation (`'a.b.c'`) paths

Please consider following this project's author, [Brian Woodward](https://github.com/doowb), and consider starring the project to show your ❤️ and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
$ npm install --save set-getter
```

## Usage

```
var getter = require('set-getter');
```

set-getter works like [set-value](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/set-value) by adding a property to an object or an object hierarchy using dot notation. The main difference is that the property is added using `Object.defineProperty` and is expected to be a getter function that returns a value.

**Example**

```
var obj = {};

// root level property
getter(obj, 'foo', function() {
  return 'bar';
});
console.log(obj.foo);
//=> 'bar'

// property dot notation
getter(obj, 'bar.baz', function() {
  return 'qux';
});
console.log(obj.bar.baz);
//=> 'qux'

// property array notation
getter(obj, ['beep', 'boop'], function() {
  return 'bop';
});
console.log(obj.beep.boop);
//=> 'bop'
```

## API

### [setGetter](/doowb/set-getter/blob/master/index.js#L31)

Defines a getter function on an object using property path notation.

**Params**

* `obj` **{Object}**: Object to add property to.
* `prop` **{String|Array}**: Property string or array to add.
* `getter` **{Function}**: Getter function to add as a property.

**Example**

```
var obj = {};
getter(obj, 'foo', function() {
  return 'bar';
});
```

## About

**Contributing**

## Transform your program with proactive **application security**

### Automated dependency updates

Open source code has nearly always been updated by the time a vulnerability has been published, so automated dependency updates are one of the most effective methods available for eradicating vulnerabilities.

**83%**

Vulnerability reduction for teams that consistently update new versions within 48 hours of publication.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/platform-dependency-updates-1.svg)

### Complete visibility and control

A unified view that prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities and gives teams crucial information, control, and oversight to make smart decisions and deploy security policies at scale.

**85%**

Increase in real-time application visibility

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Complete-visibility-and-control.svg)

### Spotlight experience

To rapidly identify and mitigate high-risk vulnerabilities, developers must quickly narrow down what matters most—which means developers need an embedded experience that highlights what’s critical.

**3X**

Risk reduction; time to remediation is cut by 75 percent.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Spotlight-experience-platform-img.svg)

### Incredible scalability

Cutting through the complex sprawl of existing tools to centralize and scale deployment is crucial for consistent developer adoption and policy implementation.

**71 Days**

Of Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR) – critical and high vulnerabilities

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/platform-scalability.svg)

MTTR
Fast, secure, compliant
Rapid results

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WTW-Slider-Logo2-1.png)

Security Architect

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/VONAGE-black.png)

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.

History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

# CVE-2021-25949

#### Date: June 10, 2021

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘set-getter’ version 0.1.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module `set-getter` can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function `setGetter()` does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or be able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.
#### PoC Details

The `setGetter()` function accepts `obj, prop, getter` as arguments. Due to the absence of validation on the values passed into the `prop` argument, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the value to include the `\_\_proto\_\_` property. Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `polluted` will be directly assigned to the new object thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `polluted` the value would be substituted as "Yes! It's Polluted" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
var setGetter = require("set-getter")

var obj = {} console.log("Before : " + {}.polluted);

setGetter(obj,'__proto__.polluted', function (polluted) { return 'Yes! Its Polluted' });

console.log("After : " + {}.polluted);
```

#### Affected Environments

# CVE-2021-25949

#### Date: June 10, 2021

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘set-getter’ version 0.1.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module `set-getter` can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function `setGetter()` does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or be able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.
#### PoC Details

The `setGetter()` function accepts `obj, prop, getter` as arguments. Due to the absence of validation on the values passed into the `prop` argument, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the value to include the `\_\_proto\_\_` property. Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `polluted` will be directly assigned to the new object thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `polluted` the value would be substituted as "Yes! It's Polluted" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
var setGetter = require("set-getter")
var obj = {}
console.log("Before : " + {}.polluted);
setGetter(obj,'__proto__.polluted',function (polluted)
{
return 'Yes! Its Polluted'
});
console.log("After : " + {}.polluted);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.1.0
#### Prevention

There are a couple of ways to mitigate prototype pollution vulnerabilities, for example: Most of the cases can be solved by freezing an object which doesn’t allow to add, remove, or change its properties. Validating the JSON input with shcema validation, this guarantees that the JSON input contains only predefined attributes. We can change the objects so they won’t have any prototype association by using “Object.create”.

#### Language: JS

Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `polluted` will be directly assigned to the new object thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `polluted` the value would be substituted as "Yes! It's Polluted" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
var setGetter = require("set-getter")

var obj = {} console.log("Before : " + {}.polluted);

setGetter(obj,'__proto__.polluted', function (polluted) { return 'Yes! Its Polluted' });

console.log("After : " + {}.polluted);
```

# CVE-2021-25949

#### Date: June 10, 2021

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘set-getter’ version 0.1.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module `set-getter` can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function `setGetter()` does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or be able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.
#### PoC Details

The `setGetter()` function accepts `obj, prop, getter` as arguments. Due to the absence of validation on the values passed into the `prop` argument, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the value to include the `\_\_proto\_\_` property. Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `polluted` will be directly assigned to the new object thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `polluted` the value would be substituted as "Yes! It's Polluted" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
var setGetter = require("set-getter") var obj = {} console.log("Before : " + {}.polluted); setGetter(obj,'__proto__.polluted',function (polluted) { return 'Yes! Its Polluted' }); console.log("After : " + {}.polluted);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.1.0
#### Prevention

Upgrade to version 0.1.1

#### Language: JS

#### Good to know:

# CVE-2021-25949

#### Date: June 10, 2021

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘set-getter’ version 0.1.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module `set-getter` can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function `setGetter()` does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or be able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.
#### PoC Details

The `setGetter()` function accepts `obj, prop, getter` as arguments. Due to the absence of validation on the values passed into the `prop` argument, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the value to include the `\_\_proto\_\_` property. Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `polluted` will be directly assigned to the new object thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `polluted` the value would be substituted as "Yes! It's Polluted" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
var setGetter = require("set-getter") var obj = {} console.log("Before : " + {}.polluted); setGetter(obj,'__proto__.polluted',function (polluted) { return 'Yes! Its Polluted' }); console.log("After : " + {}.polluted);
```

#### Affected Environments

# CVE-2021-25949

#### Date: June 10, 2021

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘set-getter’ version 0.1.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module `set-getter` can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function `setGetter()` does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or be able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.
#### PoC Details

The `setGetter()` function accepts `obj, prop, getter` as arguments. Due to the absence of validation on the values passed into the `prop` argument, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the value to include the `\_\_proto\_\_` property. Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `polluted` will be directly assigned to the new object thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `polluted` the value would be substituted as "Yes! It's Polluted" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
var setGetter = require("set-getter")
var obj = {}
console.log("Before : " + {}.polluted);
setGetter(obj,'__proto__.polluted',function (polluted)
{
return 'Yes! Its Polluted'
});
console.log("After : " + {}.polluted);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.1.0
#### Prevention

There are a couple of ways to mitigate prototype pollution vulnerabilities, for example: Most of the cases can be solved by freezing an object which doesn’t allow to add, remove, or change its properties. Validating the JSON input with shcema validation, this guarantees that the JSON input contains only predefined attributes. We can change the objects so they won’t have any prototype association by using “Object.create”.

#### Language: JS

## Cut security risks up to 70% with full-scale automated dependency updates

### Automated dependency updates

Streamline the process of keeping your software projects up-to-date and improve development efficiency.

Mend Renovate Enterprise automatically identifies outdated dependencies and creates pull requests (PRs) that suggest updates for both open source and private packages, ensuring your dependencies are always current.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Automated-dependency-updates.svg)

### Full-scale automation & support

Mend Renovate Enterprise scales to scan all of your repositories without slowing down, no matter how large your organization or applications become.

Plus, dedicated support from our team of experts ensures you get the most out of Mend Renovate Enterprise.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Full-scale-automation-support-1.svg)

### Technical debt reduction

Avoid development roadblocks caused by an accumulation of technical debt from outdated dependencies.

Mend Renovate Enterprise’s scalable automation for dependency updates minimizes technical debt by ensuring dependencies are current across all repositories.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Technical-debt-reduction-5.svg)

### Merge Confidence ratings & workflows

Mend Renovate Enterprise lets you know the impact each dependency update will have on your application.

Merge Confidence ratings and workflows prevent updates from creating extra work, by providing the likelihood an update will pass without breaking your application and grouping these updates together.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Merge-Confidence-ratings-workflows-1.svg)

### Integrates with your repos

Mend Renovate Enterprise integrates directly into your repositories to support – not overwhelm – your devs as they work on dependency updates.

[See integrations](/integrations/)

MTTR
Fast, secure, compliant
Rapid results

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WTW-Slider-Logo2-1-1.png)

Andrei Ungureanu,
Security Architect

[Read case study](https://www.mend.io/customer-success-stories/wtw-uses-mend-to-reduce-mttr/)

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Frame-1707480008.png)

Chris Wallace,
Senior Security Architect

[Read case study](https://www.mend.io/customer-success-stories/vonage/)

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”
