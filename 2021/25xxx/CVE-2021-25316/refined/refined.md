Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25316:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `detach_disks.sh` script in `s390-tools` uses predictable temporary file names in the `/tmp` directory. The script generates a cookie using `mcookie` which is a 32 character hash but it creates the temporary files sequentially and not atomically, which allows an attacker to predict the names of subsequent files by monitoring the creation of the first file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Predictable Temporary File Names:** The script creates temporary files using a predictable pattern, making them susceptible to manipulation by a local attacker. The pattern used is `/tmp/<filename>.${COOKIE}`.
- **Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:** Due to the non-atomic creation of the temporary files, an attacker can observe the first file creation and predict the rest of the file names. This allows for a race condition, where the attacker can create a symbolic link to another file before the `detach_disks.sh` script has created the temporary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If `fs.protected_symlinks` is enabled (which is the default on SUSE Linux Enterprise), an unprivileged local attacker can create symbolic links to the temporary files, preventing the `detach_disks.sh` script from creating the necessary temporary files and thus disrupting the live migration process, leading to a DoS condition.
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** If `fs.protected_symlinks` is disabled, an unprivileged local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files by creating symbolic links to files they wish to overwrite.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the `detach_disks.sh` script is executed.
- **Monitoring `/tmp` Directory:** The attacker uses a tool like `inotifywait` to monitor the `/tmp` directory for new file creation and extract the cookie from the first created file.
- **Symbolic Link Creation:**  The attacker creates symlinks with the predictable paths before the script can create the temporary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unprivileged User:** The attacker needs to be a local unprivileged user.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to run scripts and execute commands on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `detach_disks.sh` script used in the `s390-tools` package.
- The fix involves using `mktemp` to create temporary directories or individual temporary files with unpredictable names and/or by generating a unique cookie value before creating any temporary files. The fix was implemented by replacing the usage of `COOKIE=$(mcookie)` with `$(mktemp /tmp/<filename>.XXXXXX)`
- The vulnerability was addressed in openSUSE Factory, SLE-12-SP5, SLE-15-SP2, and SLE-15-SP3 via updated packages.
- The bug was assigned the Bugzilla ID 1182777.
