| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1182777#c0)  Wolfgang Frisch   2021-02-25 18:03:40 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1180877](show_bug.cgi?id=1180877 "RESOLVED FIXED") +++  In openSUSE:Factory/s390-tools/detach_disks.sh, predictable /tmp files are used.  ``` COOKIE=$(mcookie) DASDFILE=/tmp/dasd.list.${COOKIE} DETFILE=/tmp/detach.disks.${COOKIE} KEEPFILE=/tmp/keep.disks.${COOKIE} NICFILE=/tmp/nic.list.${COOKIE} FAILFILE=/tmp/error.${COOKIE} ```  The cookie is an unpredictable 32 character hash. However, since the script does not create all temp files at once, we can watch /tmp with inotify, get the cookie from the first created file, and predict the remaining paths.  Example run of detach_disks.sh, logged with `inotifywait -m -e create /tmp/`: ``` /tmp/ CREATE dasd.list.ce4955d2133c9c6e425791e39af56340 /tmp/ CREATE detach.disks.ce4955d2133c9c6e425791e39af56340 /tmp/ CREATE keep.disks.ce4955d2133c9c6e425791e39af56340 /tmp/ CREATE nic.list.ce4955d2133c9c6e425791e39af56340 ```  Steps to reproduce: As root: - configure ZVM_DISKS_TO_DETACH in /etc/sysconfig/virtsetup   e.g. ZVM_DISKS_TO_DETACH="1" - mkdir /test - touch /test/shadow  As an unprivileged user: - Run the attached `PoC-detach_disks.py`  As root: - /usr/lib/systemd/scripts/detach_disks.sh  Consequences: - If fs.protected_symlinks = 1 (default on SLE),   the unprivileged user can deny the service of detach_disks.sh. - If fs.protected_symlinks = 0,   the unprivileged user can overwrite arbitrary files. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1182777#c1)  Wolfgang Frisch   2021-02-25 18:04:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 846546](attachment.cgi?id=846546) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=846546&action=edit) PoC-detach_disks.py ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1182777#c2)  Wolfgang Frisch   2021-02-25 18:10:59 UTC  ``` One solution would be to confine all the temp files in a securely created temporary directory, e.g. with tmpdir=$(mktemp -d /tmp/detach_disks.XXXXXX). ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1182777#c4)  Mark Post   2021-02-26 20:37:23 UTC  ``` I am considering making the following change. It should eliminate any possibility of "guessing" the filenames that are being created.

This is OK in principal but there's a typo in the suggested changes: It should be $(mcookie) instead of ${mcookie}, which refers to a non-existent variable.  The standard `mktemp` utility would be an acceptable alternative, e.g.: DASDFILE=$(/tmp/dasd.list.XXXXXX) ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1182777#c7)  Wolfgang Frisch   2021-02-28 21:33:13 UTC  ``` DASDFILE=$(mktemp /tmp/dasd.list.XXXXXX) ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1182777#c8)  Mark Post   2021-02-28 23:22:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wolfgang Frisch from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1182777#c6)) -snip- > This is OK in principal but there's a typo in the suggested changes: It > should be $(mcookie) instead of ${mcookie}, which refers to a non-existent > variable.

([Show diff](/request/show/876032?diff_to_superseded=875842))

##### Overview

### Request 875842 superseded

- Updated detach\_disks.sh to not use predictable temporary file

 names. (bsc#1182777)

- Made for the following changes for bsc#1182816:

 \* Updated s390-tools-sles15sp3-Format-devices-in-parallel.patch to

 change all instances of the progress bar from printing "#" to

 printing the process number of the DASD volume being formatted.

 \* Updated s390-tools-sles15sp3-Implement-Y-yast\_mode.patch to print

 out the numbder of cylinders in a device, as was done in the

 prior versions of this patch, but was missed when modifying it

 for SLES15 SP3.

 \* Added s390-tools-sles15sp3-check-return-code-from-util\_file\_read\_l.patch

 because otherwise a warning message from dasdfmt is being generated

 that could interfere with YaST properly processing the progress

 of the formatting process.

1. Request 876032

This request is superseded by
[request 877835](/request/show/877835)
([Show diff](/request/show/877835?diff_to_superseded=876032))

##### Overview

### Request 876032 superseded

- Updated detach\_disks.sh to not use predictable temporary file

 names. (bsc#1182777, CVE-2021-25316)

- Made for the following changes for bsc#1182816:

 \* Updated s390-tools-sles15sp3-Format-devices-in-parallel.patch to

 change all instances of the progress bar from printing "#" to

 printing the process number of the DASD volume being formatted.

 \* Updated s390-tools-sles15sp3-Implement-Y-yast\_mode.patch to print

 out the numbder of cylinders in a device, as was done in the

 prior versions of this patch, but was missed when modifying it

 for SLES15 SP3.

 \* Added s390-tools-sles15sp3-check-return-code-from-util\_file\_read\_l.patch

 because otherwise a warning message from dasdfmt is being generated

 that could interfere with YaST properly processing the progress

 of the formatting process.

This request supersedes:
[request 876032](/request/show/876032)
([Show diff](/request/show/877835?diff_to_superseded=876032))

##### Overview

### Request 877835 accepted

- Added s390-tools-sles15sp3-zipl-fix-4k-scsi-ipl.patch (bsc#1183039)

 IPL is not working when bootloader is installed on a SCSI disk

 with 4k physical blocksize without using a devicemapper target.

- Added s390-tools-sles15sp3-remove-no-pie-link-arguments.patch so

 that we can build on systems with binutils 2.36 and higher. Without

 this, the build fails because that version of the ld command

 doesn't recognize "-no-pie" an acceptable argument.

- Updated the mkdump.pl script to make the name of the temporary

 configuration file in /tmp/ unpredictable. (bsc#1182876)

- Updated detach\_disks.sh to not use predictable temporary file

 names. (bsc#1182777, CVE-2021-25316)

- Made for the following changes for bsc#1182816:

 \* Updated s390-tools-sles15sp3-Format-devices-in-parallel.patch to
