## Transform your program with proactive **application security**

### Automated dependency updates

Open source code has nearly always been updated by the time a vulnerability has been published, so automated dependency updates are one of the most effective methods available for eradicating vulnerabilities.

**83%**

Vulnerability reduction for teams that consistently update new versions within 48 hours of publication.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/platform-dependency-updates-1.svg)

### Complete visibility and control

A unified view that prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities and gives teams crucial information, control, and oversight to make smart decisions and deploy security policies at scale.

**85%**

Increase in real-time application visibility

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Complete-visibility-and-control.svg)

### Spotlight experience

To rapidly identify and mitigate high-risk vulnerabilities, developers must quickly narrow down what matters most—which means developers need an embedded experience that highlights what’s critical.

**3X**

Risk reduction; time to remediation is cut by 75 percent.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Spotlight-experience-platform-img.svg)

### Incredible scalability

Cutting through the complex sprawl of existing tools to centralize and scale deployment is crucial for consistent developer adoption and policy implementation.

**71 Days**

Of Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR) – critical and high vulnerabilities

MTTR
Fast, secure, compliant
Rapid results

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WTW-Slider-Logo2-1.png)

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

# CVE-2021-25981

#### Date: January 3, 2022

#### Overview

In Talkyard, regular versions v0.2021.20 through v0.2021.33 and dev versions v0.2021.20 through v0.2021.34, are vulnerable to Insufficient Session Expiration. This may allow an attacker to reuse the admin’s still-valid session token even when logged-out, to gain admin privileges, given the attacker is able to obtain that token (via other, hypothetical attacks)
#### Details

Sessions in Talkyard are not terminated from the server-side once the user initiates a logout, which makes it possible for an attacker to reuse the admin cookies via other hypothetical attacks.
#### PoC Details

As the victim admin, login with your credentials. Export save the cookie values for later. Then proceed by logging out of the application.

Now, as an attacker, import the admin’s cookie values to the browser. Now refresh the page and you will notice that you are signed as the admin
#### Affected Environments

v0.2021.20 through v0.2021.34
#### Prevention

Upgrade to version v0.2021.35

#### Language: TYPE\_SCRIPT

#### Good to know:

## Cut security risks up to 70% with full-scale automated dependency updates

### Automated dependency updates

Streamline the process of keeping your software projects up-to-date and improve development efficiency.

Mend Renovate Enterprise automatically identifies outdated dependencies and creates pull requests (PRs) that suggest updates for both open source and private packages, ensuring your dependencies are always current.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Automated-dependency-updates.svg)

### Full-scale automation & support

Mend Renovate Enterprise scales to scan all of your repositories without slowing down, no matter how large your organization or applications become.

Plus, dedicated support from our team of experts ensures you get the most out of Mend Renovate Enterprise.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Full-scale-automation-support-1.svg)

### Technical debt reduction

Avoid development roadblocks caused by an accumulation of technical debt from outdated dependencies.

Mend Renovate Enterprise’s scalable automation for dependency updates minimizes technical debt by ensuring dependencies are current across all repositories.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Technical-debt-reduction-5.svg)

### Merge Confidence ratings & workflows

Mend Renovate Enterprise lets you know the impact each dependency update will have on your application.

Merge Confidence ratings and workflows prevent updates from creating extra work, by providing the likelihood an update will pass without breaking your application and grouping these updates together.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Merge-Confidence-ratings-workflows-1.svg)

### Integrates with your repos

Mend Renovate Enterprise integrates directly into your repositories to support – not overwhelm – your devs as they work on dependency updates.

[See integrations](/integrations/)

MTTR
Fast, secure, compliant
Rapid results

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WTW-Slider-Logo2-1-1.png)

Andrei Ungureanu,
Security Architect

[Read case study](https://www.mend.io/customer-success-stories/wtw-uses-mend-to-reduce-mttr/)

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Frame-1707480008.png)

Chris Wallace,
Senior Security Architect

[Read case study](https://www.mend.io/customer-success-stories/vonage/)

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

# CVE-2021-25981

#### Date: January 3, 2022

#### Overview

In Talkyard, regular versions v0.2021.20 through v0.2021.33 and dev versions v0.2021.20 through v0.2021.34, are vulnerable to Insufficient Session Expiration. This may allow an attacker to reuse the admin’s still-valid session token even when logged-out, to gain admin privileges, given the attacker is able to obtain that token (via other, hypothetical attacks)
#### Details

Sessions in Talkyard are not terminated from the server-side once the user initiates a logout, which makes it possible for an attacker to reuse the admin cookies via other hypothetical attacks.
#### PoC Details

As the victim admin, login with your credentials. Export save the cookie values for later. Then proceed by logging out of the application.

Now, as an attacker, import the admin’s cookie values to the browser. Now refresh the page and you will notice that you are signed as the admin
#### Affected Environments

v0.2021.20 through v0.2021.34
#### Prevention

Upgrade to version v0.2021.35

#### Language: TYPE\_SCRIPT

#### Good to know:
