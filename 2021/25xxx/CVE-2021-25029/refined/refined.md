- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize or escape the Course's module input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges (Admin+) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website. This code can then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected content, potentially leading to actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with admin access can add a course through the learning management page and inject the malicious payload into the "Insert Module" field. When the saved module is displayed to another user, the XSS payload gets executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the WordPress site to create a new course and insert the malicious payload.
