Emby Server 4.6 is currently rolling out. Here are the highlights.

Rewritten Music Scanning

This 4.6 release will rescan your music library. We apologize if this causes any inconvenience. This solves a lot of our previous music-related shortcomings,Â specifically:

* Any folder structure now accepted, no matter how clean or dirty
* Albums are now fully tag driven and are no longer tied to folders
* Local metadata for albums will still be supported, and local metadata for artists will be back as well. This will be the only feature of a music library that will require a predictable folder structure. If you enable these options you'll need to have an artist\album\track folder structure, otherwise you'll likely end up seeing nfo files and images in unexpected places. You'll need to use your music library options to indicate your music folder structure if you'd like to use local artwork.
* Preserve original order of tagged genres, artists, album artists, tags, etc.
* Support multiple musicbrainz id's tagged on songs and albums
* Support for composers
* Library metadata options for artists now working again (and still working for albums)
* The Folders tab is now an actual folder view and will work properly as such

Music Composer Support

This was mentioned above, but if your audio files are tagged with composer values, then you'll now see a new Composers tab in your music library:

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.666a49cf68069ba6db9bb4a1e0cd4cbb.png)

Improved Database and User Interface Performance

All Emby apps should feel snappier than ever thanks to a plethora of new improvements in your Emby server database.

Reworked Collection Storage Model

Collections have now been reworked to be based on the set tag in your nfo files (if you use nfo). The popular AutoBoxSets plugin is now a built-in feature:

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.b833e35e386e18fba83eeb26820c4edd.png)

HDR Tone Mapping When Transcoding

Check out the new options in the server transcoding menu!

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.4b9e87b79ad50fe96df96141c86a4271.png)

If you have a server machine powerful enough, you can now enjoy tone mapping when transcoding. No more washed out colors !

Combined Next Up and Continue Watching

Hopefully this is not a controversial one, but our out of box behavior is now a Netflix-style Continue Watching list, with everything together:

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.91d8b0da6380f98c3f79e75a5a4ac507.png)

If you prefer the old Next Up section, you can use your Emby user home screen settings to add it back as a configuration section.

New Live TV Channel Management Screen

This is a new WMC-inspired channel management screen that will allow you to quickly disable channels you don't want, drag and drop re-order, edit channel names, channel numbers, and map channels to guide data.

![1533281946_image.thumb.png.c454a90c8ff7edd35c4b49c40444bceb1.png.2e2eea585368e1c0c812a7a53f2e44ac.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/1533281946_image.thumb.png.c454a90c8ff7edd35c4b49c40444bceb1.png.2e2eea585368e1c0c812a7a53f2e44ac.png.b83cc2a3c736730eee7d271e53edde72.png)

Just click on a channel to edit the options:

![1533281946_image.thumb.png.c454a90c8ff7edd35c4b49c40444bceb1.png.2e2eea585368e1c0c812a7a53f2e44ac.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/1533281946_image.thumb.png.c454a90c8ff7edd35c4b49c40444bceb1.png.2e2eea585368e1c0c812a7a53f2e44ac.png.7b60a1a62f9579036f38db8c754a2012.png)

Support for Live TV Channel Groups (via Tags)

Use the above editor to add tags to channels, and now you'll see a new Tags tab in your Live TV section.

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.31abb652c883e113af3ee2adca5d59e6.png)

Automatic importing of groups in m3u tuners is also supported.

You can even group your channel display into Tags if desired:

[![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.thumb.png.19876ef42d0a59f7f8290265e2a66881.png)](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.e86a0833ea554994bad80b719616d6a6.png)

Improved Performance of Live TV Guide Refresh

The live tv guide refresh process for all live tv should be slightly improved (5-10% faster). But if you're using xmltv guide data, you can expect major, dramatic improvements in the neighborhood of about 70% faster. To give you an example of the improvement, on a guide with 4000 channels, the guide data refresh has gone from roughly 2.5 hours to 45 minutes.

Multiple Channel Logo Support

Using Emby Guide Data, the server now downloads multiple logos per channel in different colors. This way our apps can choose the most appropriate logo based on your chosen color scheme in the user interface.

If you don't use Emby Guide Data, you can still configure these logos manually using the image editor.

![1533281946_image.thumb.png.c454a90c8ff7edd35c4b49c40444bceb1.png.2e2eea585368e1c0c812a7a53f2e44ac.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/1533281946_image.thumb.png.c454a90c8ff7edd35c4b49c40444bceb1.png.2e2eea585368e1c0c812a7a53f2e44ac.png.14e1db869c7acb8e8b1d43dde9c3d164.png)

![1533281946_image.thumb.png.c454a90c8ff7edd35c4b49c40444bceb1.png.2e2eea585368e1c0c812a7a53f2e44ac.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/1533281946_image.thumb.png.c454a90c8ff7edd35c4b49c40444bceb1.png.2e2eea585368e1c0c812a7a53f2e44ac.png.fc3d0f09b27c512aff6794ec65621684.png)

Multi-Select List Items

Lists now have the same multi-select management features that you've already grown accustomed to in poster views.

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.917ec0233f5d5c143d06ed1f87c4ed95.png)

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.d77280673bba2adaabc8c3ffbedfd31f.png)

Multi-Select Filtering

When you filter by genres, tags, studios and other criteria, you can now select multiple.

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.20df776c1246bb9e16b0706ba67f207a.png)

New User Profile Options to Control Remembering Track Selections

For both audio and subtitles, you can now control whether or not track selections are remembered, as well as clear your remembered tracks anytime you wish.

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.b68be322cdf660561204e408c310a03b.png)

New Field Display Options

The 3-dot menu above lists has been enhanced to allow new fields to be displayed:

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.e74d84e219119152de7a5402dd17370f.png)

This allows you to see ratings in lists if desired.

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.0982141fa1f23a8e0864c1992e451fec.png)

New and Improved Image Editor

It comes with the following improvements:

* Dedicated options to set an image from a url
* All image slots visible in the editor to allow you to easily see what can be customized
* Easy drag and drop backdrop reordering

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.914ebeb412a5ef7c34a3085559928f69.png)

New Live Button in Live TV Guide

As you scroll ahead in time, now you can easily jump back to the live time with the press of a button.

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.237d3b67e5b9155913010e6bc557346d.png)

Live TV Programs Grouped in Suggestions and Search

You'll now see Shows and Movies grouped as one single entry, rather than separate entries for every single airing.

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.9dc3b2ccf907e510c913e38e61131fb5.png)

When you click on a show, you'll then see all of the showing for it:

![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.a5b5b061ad7b18796547cd06cb75ecf1.png)

This will make it easier to find shows and movies that you'd like to watch and record.

Improved Single Channel Screen Display

The single channel listings not only perform better, but now also display much more information than before.

[![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.thumb.png.abeab95316066c728a79c88824141c1e.png)](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.20d7ededaabeae216100c8e7968984fd.png)

Remove from Continue Watching

Would you like to get something out of continue watching, but without having to lose your watch progress? Now you can:

[![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.thumb.png.901316a220556de60b4a1f7a5109dc8b.png)](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.b2c46c8494dff32dc4dab87e52398b11.png)

This will remove it from the Continue Watching menu, and it will reappear if you start watching again.

Context Menu Improvements

The addition of the title and poster should help make the menus a little more fun to use.

[![Untitled.png](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.thumb.png.697f729c2a3f0d1a078cf80121edea4d.png)](https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2021_05/Untitled.png.773793338e84f073db16a3a3c8c56d1b.png)

# Incorrect Access Control - Don't require a password on the local network (CVE-2021-25827)Â #3784

## Description

![@Xitro01](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19844787?u=12432f4bf49cad915ef0fcf53d96188c0c67b3cc&v=4&size=48)[Xitro01](https://github.com/Xitro01)opened [on Jun 22, 2023](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/3784#issue-1770190831)

Two years ago I reported an issue regarding the "Don't require a password on the local network" function in Emby Media Server.

This function was susceptible to a login bypass attack by setting the X-Forwarded-For header to a local IP-address:

`By using the X-Forwarded-For header and set this to a local IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.1/127.0.0.1) it is possible to bypass the IP whitelist feature, but not only that, it's possible to bypass authentication completely in some cases where the feature "Don't require a password on the local network" is used.`

This issue has been resolved in version [4.7.12.0](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Releases/releases/tag/4.7.12.0)

"Don't allow local network addresses to be specified in x-forwarded-for and x-real-ip"

I tested this and I confirm that this issue has been resolved.

This vulnerability is known as [CVE-2021-25827](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m4q9-68f2-5wc6 "CVE-2021-25827").

# Emby Server Proxy Header Spoofing Vulnerability

Critical

[softworkz](/softworkz)
published
GHSA-fffj-6fr6-3fgf
May 25, 2023

## Package

Emby Server
(Emby)

## Affected versions

<= 4.7.11

## Patched versions

4.7.12

Emby Server Beta
(Emby)

<= 4.8.0.30

4.8.0.31

## Description

### Context

Emby Server is a user-installable home media server that organizes user's media files making them available on the local network as well as optionally remotely featuring a broad range of client devices.

### Impact

This vulnerability may allow administrative access to an Emby Server system, depending on certain user account settings. Emby server employs a determination of "Local Network" vs. "Non-Local Network" depending on connection parameters of a remote request. This determination in turn, may affect the behavior of certain features and also the requirements regarding account logins.

By spoofing certain headers which are intended for interoperation with reverse proxy servers, it may be possible to affect the local/non-local network determination to allow logging in without password or to view a list of user accounts which may have no password configured.

Impacted are all Emby Server system which are publicly accessible and where the administrator hasn't tightened the account login configuration for administrative users.

### Patches

Emby Server Beta 4.8.0.31, 26 April 2023 or later.

Emby Server Stable Release 4.7.0.12 or later.

### Workarounds

The recommended mitigation for pre-patch versions is to simply configure:

All administrative accounts (preferable all accounts) to have a password assigned.

All administrative accounts (preferable all accounts) have Local network sign in mode set to "Require a password on the local network".

Note: Both of these settings are found on the password tab of each user.
