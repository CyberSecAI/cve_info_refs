## Package

k8s.io/ingress-nginx
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.2.1

## Patched versions

1.2.1

## Description

A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where a user that can create or update ingress objects can use a newline character to bypass the sanitization of the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field of an Ingress object (in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group) to obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@cjcullen](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7154008?u=538844ae5710b6df2f64d59b2010d2265d81fa65&v=4&size=48)[cjcullen](https://github.com/cjcullen)opened [on Jun 10, 2022](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/126814#issue-2475632907)
### Issue Details

A security issue was discovered in [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) where a user that can create or update ingress objects can use a newline character to bypass the sanitization of the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field of an Ingress object (in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group) to obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.

This issue has been rated High ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)), and assigned [CVE-2021-25748](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-863x-868h-968x "CVE-2021-25748").

### Affected Components and Configurations

This bug affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running `kubectl get po -n ingress-nginx`.

If you are running the “chrooted” ingress-nginx controller introduced in v1.2.0 (gcr.io/k8s-staging-ingress-nginx/controller-chroot), you are not affected.

Multitenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Ingress objects are most affected by this issue.

#### Affected Versions

<v1.2.1

#### Fixed Versions

v1.2.1

### Mitigation

If you are unable to roll out the fix, this vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing an admission policy that restricts the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field on the networking.k8s.io/Ingress resource to known safe characters (see the newly added [rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blame/main/internal/ingress/inspector/rules.go), or the suggested value for [annotation-value-word-blocklist](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#annotation-value-word-blocklist)).

### Detection

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io

### Additional Details

See ingress-nginx Issue [#8686](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/126814) for more details.

### Acknowledgements

This vulnerability was reported by Gafnit Amiga.

Thank You,

CJ Cullen on behalf of the Kubernetes Security Response Committee

# [Security Advisory] CVE-2021-25748: Ingress-nginx `path` sanitization can be bypassed with newline character

### Issue Details

A security issue was discovered in [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) where a user that can create or update ingress objects can use a newline character to bypass the sanitization of the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field of an Ingress object (in the `[networking.k8s.io](http://networking.k8s.io)` or `extensions` API group) to obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.

This issue has been rated High ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)), and assigned CVE-2021-25748.

### Affected Components and Configurations

This bug affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running `kubectl get po -n ingress-nginx`.

If you are running the “chrooted” ingress-nginx controller introduced in v1.2.0 ([gcr.io/k8s-staging-ingress-nginx/controller-chroot](http://gcr.io/k8s-staging-ingress-nginx/controller-chroot)), you are not affected.

Multitenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Ingress objects are most affected by this issue.

### Affected Versions

* <v1.2.1

### Fixed Versions

* v1.2.1

### Mitigation

If you are unable to roll out the fix, this vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing an admission policy that restricts the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` field on the [networking.k8s.io/Ingress](http://networking.k8s.io/Ingress) resource to known safe characters (see the newly added [rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blame/main/internal/ingress/inspector/rules.go), or the suggested value for [annotation-value-word-blocklist](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#annotation-value-word-blocklist)).

### Detection

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact secu...@kubernetes.io

### Additional Details

See ingress-nginx Issue [#8686](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/8686) for more details.

### Acknowledgements

This vulnerability was reported by Gafnit Amiga.

Thank You,

CJ Cullen on behalf of the Kubernetes Security Response Committee
