- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a webpage that will be executed by the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirecting users to phishing sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting specific URLs that contain malicious JavaScript code within the `form_id` and `title` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it, which can be done through social engineering or other means. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
