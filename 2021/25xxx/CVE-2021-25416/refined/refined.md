Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25416:

**CVE-2021-25416: Possible creating executable kernel page via abusing dynamic load functions**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an improper address validation within the RKP (Real-time Kernel Protection) module. Specifically, the dynamic load functions are abused.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Address Validation:** The core issue is that the RKP fails to properly validate addresses when using dynamic load functions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Executable Kernel Page Creation:** An attacker who has already compromised the EL1 (Exception Level 1) can exploit this vulnerability to create an executable kernel page outside the designated code area. This could lead to further exploitation, including the execution of arbitrary code within the kernel, allowing complete control over the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromised EL1:** The attacker needs to have already gained access to EL1. This suggests the vulnerability is not directly exploitable from an unprivileged context. It requires some level of system compromise first to access EL1.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **EL1 Access:** The attacker must have already compromised EL1 to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary**
This vulnerability allows an attacker with EL1 access to create an executable kernel page outside the designated code area by abusing dynamic load functions due to an improper address validation. This could lead to arbitrary code execution in the kernel and complete device compromise. The patch adds proper address validation in RKP to prevent creation of executable kernel pages.
