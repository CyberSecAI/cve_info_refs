# AutoStart VirtualBox VMs on System Boot on Linux

[koromicha](https://kifarunix.com/author/ak_mibey/)|Last Updated: March 12, 2024|[Virtualization](https://kifarunix.com/virtualization/), [HowTos](https://kifarunix.com/howtos/), [VirtualBox](https://kifarunix.com/virtualization/virtualbox/)|[14 Comments](https://kifarunix.com/autostart-virtualbox-vms-on-system-boot-on-linux/#comments)

In this guide, we are going to learn how to [autostart VirtualBox VMs on system boot](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#autostart) on Linux. On a Linux system with VirtualBox installed, you can start VMs automatically during system boot.

## Automatically Start VirtualBox VMs on System Boot on Linux

There are multiple ways in which you can configure your VirtualBox vms to automatically start on system boot.

A few of these ways that we will discuss in this guide include;

1. [Using VirtualBox Autostart Service](#vbox-autostart-service)- [Using Systemd service unit](#using-systemd-service)- [Using system cronjobs](#using-cronjob)

### Using VirtualBox Autostart Service

VirtualBox comes with a service called **vboxautostart-service** that makes it easy to automatically start virtual machines during system reboot.

In order to configure a VirtualBox VM to start on system boot on Linux, you need to activate the autostart service. The autostart service can be activated by setting two variables in **/etc/default/virtualbox**;

* **VBOXAUTOSTART\_DB** – which defines the absolute path to the autostart database directory, usually the **/etc/vbox**.* **VBOXAUTOSTART\_CONFIG** – defines the path to the virtual machine autostart configuration.

These variables can be defined as;
```
VBOXAUTOSTART_DB=/etc/vbox
VBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG=/etc/vbox/autostartvm.cfg
```

To place these variables in the **/etc/default/virtualbox**, run the command below;
```
echo -e "VBOXAUTOSTART_DB=/etc/vbox\nVBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG=/etc/vbox/autostartvm.cfg" | sudo tee /etc/default/virtualbox
```

Define the virtual machine autostart configuration settings. The autostart configuration file contains options that controls how the virtual machine is auto started.

```
sudo vim /etc/vbox/autostartvm.cfg
```
```

default_policy = deny

kifarunix = {
    allow = true
    startup_delay = 10
}

```

* **default\_policy** – defines whether to allow or deny the virtual machine autostart by default. In our example above, we denied any one from auto-starting the VM and explicitly allow one user, amos.* **username** (kifarunix) – with the default deny policy, you can define the specific users that are allowed to autostart the virtual machine (**allow = trues**). You can also define how long to delay the VM startup. 10 seconds is used in this demo.

#### Set Ownership of Database directory

The database directory, **/etc/vbox**, should be writable by the user to be used to start VMs automatically. To make it easy, you can simply add your user to **vboxusers** group and set the group ownership of the database directory to vboxusers group. After that, set the write permissions for the group. In this case, amos user is to be used to automatically start the virtual machine.
```
sudo usermod -aG vboxusers kifarunix
```
```
sudo chgrp vboxusers /etc/vbox
```

Assign the group write permissions on the autostart database directory.
```
sudo chmod g+w /etc/vbox
```

To shield the directory from being modified or deleted by other users except the owner or the root user, set sticky bit.
```
sudo chmod +t /etc/vbox
```
#### Enable Virtual Machine Autostart

As a user, you can enable autostart for individual machines. This requires that you define the path to the database directory first.

```
VBoxManage setproperty autostartdbpath /etc/vbox/
```

Once that is done, you can now setup the virtual machine to automatically start on system boot.
```
vboxmanage modifyvm fedora30 --autostart-enabled on
```

Where **fedora30** is the name of your virtual machine. You can also use UUID instead.

You can get the names/UUIDs of the vms by running the command below;

```
vboxmanage list vms
```
#### Restart  vboxautostart-service

The configuration is now done. To effect the settings, you need to restart the  **vboxautostart-service**.
```
sudo systemctl restart vboxautostart-service
```
#### Testing the Virtual Machine autostart

To test that your virtual machine can actually autostart on system boot, reboot you system and check. When system boots, your VM should now be running.

If you which to disable the virtual machine autostart;
```
vboxmanage modifyvm fedora30 --autostart-enabled off
```
### Using Systemd service unit

Similarly, you can auto-start a VirtualBox by a creating a systemd service that starts the respective VM when system reboots.

To use this approach, just create the systemd unit service as follows (replace the name of the vm accordingly);
```
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/fedora30-vm.service
```
```

[Unit]
Description=Autostart VirtualBox VM
After=network.target vboxdrv.service

[Service]
User=kifarunix
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vboxheadless -s fedora30
ExecStop=/usr/bin/VBoxManage controlvm fedora30 acpipowerbutton

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

Replace the **`User=kifarunix`**, with your correct username.

Reload the systemd daemon to read the new unit file:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the service to start automatically on boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable vmname.service
```

Reboot the system and confirm if all is good.
### Autostart VirtualBox VM using System Cronjob

It is also possible to use cronjob to automatically start a virtualbox machine on system reboot.

Simply, as user with which you want to start the VirtualBox vm as, create a cronjob as follows;

```
crontab -e
```

Enter this line to start your VM. Replace the names accordingly;
```
@reboot sleep 60 && vboxheadless --startvm "fedora30" &
```

The command simply starts the vm 1 minute after the system boots.

That is all! You have learnt how to automatically start VirtualBox VMs on system boot on Linux using the following methods;

1. Using VirtualBox Autostart Service- Using Systemd service unit- Using system cronjobs

   Your directions are great! Thanks! Much, much better than the official VirtualBox documentation (see “9.23.1. Linux: Starting the Autostart Service With init”) which very, very briefly mentions about one tenth of what you mentioned above.

     You have an error in your

     you have autostart.cfg but you name the file autostartvm.cfg

               On ubuntu 20 and having issues getting this working.
               I am able to trigger it to start by manually restarting the service using

               sudo systemctl restart vboxautostart-service

               However, when rebooting it does not start on its own.
               Any advice on where and what to look for logs?
               I do get a notification in syslogs that “Starting VirtualBox VMs configured for autostart.”

                   You can also use other methods like using systemd or cronjob described in the guide.

                   In Chronjob, ‘VBoxHeadless –startvm “vmname” ‘ may be better for troubleshooting.
                   For regular use, ‘VBoxManage startvm “vmname” –type headless’ may be preferred.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-03-02 11:25:13 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1180879](show_bug.cgi?id=1180879 "RESOLVED FIXED")  The security team is currently inspecting scripts and code checked into OBS directly in openSUSE:Factory packages.  As part of this I looked into the virtualbox package which has the following script files checked in:  - fix_usb_rules.sh - update-extpack.sh - vboxautostart.sh - vboxconfig.sh - vboxdrv.sh - vboxweb-service.sh - virtualbox-patch-source.sh - virtualbox-wrapper.sh  Most of these scripts seem to have been extracted from the RPM distributions provided by www.virtualbox.org.  The "autostart" mechanism uses a "database" directory in /etc/vbox. There exist instructions on the Internet to set this directory up as a sticky bit directory owned by root:vboxusers mode 1775, for example in [1].  [1]: <https://kifarunix.com/autostart-virtualbox-vms-on-system-boot-on-linux>  The script vboxautostart.sh, vboxdrv.sh and vboxweb-service.sh all run as root and source /etc/vbox/vbox.cfg.  In our openSUSE packaging bad permissions are used for /etc/vbox at least since OBS sr#662944, which, ironically, says "proper permissions for /etc/vbox/*.cfg". However the following lines in the %files section of the spec file cause trouble:  ``` %dir %{_sysconfdir}/vbox %attr(1775,root,vboxusers) %{_sysconfdir}/vbox ```  The follow-up `%attr` line is not effective, causing the sticky bit to be missing during installation. The directory is stilled group-writable by the vboxusers group though.  This means that any member of the vboxusers group can replace the /etc/vbox/vbox.cfg file by a manipulated once, allowing for full code execution in the context of the root user once e.g. the vboxautostart systemd service runs.  Reproducer:  ``` root# su -g vboxusers nobody nobody$ cd /etc/vbox nobody$ cp vbox.cfg vbox.cfg.new nobody$ rm -f vbox.cfg nobody$ mv vbox.cfg.new vbox.cfg nobody$ echo "touch /root/evil" >>vbox.cfg  nobody$ exit root# systemctl start vboxautostart.service root# ls -lh /root/evil -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0  2. Mär 12:14 /root/evil ```  I have been looking into other distributions like Arch Linux, Fedora and also some of the RPMs distributed on www.virtualbox.org. It seems they all package /etc/vbox as root:root mode 755.  This local root exploit therefore seems to be openSUSE specific and we will need to assign a SUSE CVE for this issue. We can handle fixing and publication of this issue ourselves.  virtualbox is not in any enterprise versions of SUSE it seems. But all of openSUSE:Leap:15.{1,2,3} is also affected and needs to be fixed.  If you are aware of any other distribution that has the packaging error then please tell us so we can give them a heads up. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-03-02 11:46:02 UTC  ``` I also want to bring to your attention that the "correct" setup of /etc/vbox with sticky bit set i.e. mode 1775 and ownership root:vboxusers is still not robust, security wise.  When looking at the script vboxautostart.sh we find the following logic for autostarting VM  ```     IFS=$'\n'     [...]     if [ -r $VBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG ]; then         [...]         # find all the files of type username.start         var=$(ls $VBOXAUTOSTART_DB | grep start | grep -v auto)         # process each file of that type         for i in $var; do             # Extract the user name - the first word on the line             user=$(echo $i | head -n1 | cut -d "." -f1)             # autostart the VMs for that user             begin_msg "Starting VMs for user $user" console             su - $user -c "/usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxAutostart --start --config $VBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG"             succ_msg "VMs for user $user started"         done     fi     IFS=$OLD_IFS ```  VBOXAUTOSTART_DB is set to /etc/vbox in /etc/default/virtualbox.  Even with the sticky bit set on /etc/vbox, any member of the vboxusers group can create arbitrary new files in this directory. This means due to the line      user=$(echo $i | head -n1 | cut -d "." -f1)  any member of the vboxusers group can manipulate the value of this user variable. This user variable is then passed to `su` as second argument:      su - $user -c "/usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxAutostart --start --config $VBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG"  Example reproducer:  ``` root# su -g vboxusers nobody nobody$ cd /etc/vbox nobody$ touch -- '-s myshell.start' nobody$ exit root# /usr/lib/virtualbox/vboxautostart.sh start vboxautostart.sh: Starting VirtualBox VMs configured for autostart. vboxautostart.sh: Starting VMs for user -s myshell. su: failed to execute  myshell: No such file or directory ```  Luckily this is not a full local root exploit. Two aspects are reponsible for this:  - filenames cannot contain slash '/' characters, therefore we cannot specify   any valid executable beyond the CWD of the autosart.sh script. - the $user argument is passed before the `-c   /usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxAutostart` parameter. And the command line parsing   logic of su lets the final `-c` parameter "win", i.e. the attacker cannot   influence the command that is run.  Still a local attacker can specify arbitrary other parameters to `su` this way e.g. the `--group=mygroup` parameter. It could be a successful attack vector when combined with other security issues.  Beyond this any member of the vboxusers group can influence the autostart setting of other users, as long as the victim user is allowed to autostart via /etc/vbox/autostart.cfg.  On a more generic level the design of /etc/vbox with sticky bit set allows any member of the vboxusers group to trigger a run of /usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxAutostart as any local user (by influencing the $user value) or as root with any local group (by setting $user to --group=mygroup).  Given all this I don't recommend granting write access to /etc/vbox to the vboxusers group. Please package it as root:root mode 755.  This robustness issue with the sticky bit involved might be something that we need to report to Oracle upstream or whoever is responsible for this whole idea of a /etc/vbox sticky bit directory writeable by the vboxusers group. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c5)  Larry Finger   2021-04-02 20:09:10 UTC  ``` I changed the ownership of /etc/vbox to root:root with mode 755. After that, VBoxManage was unable to set autostart on. It failed with an access violation.  I then installed the latest test version of VirtualBox from Oracle. It has the same problem.  Only when I set the ownership to root:vboxusers with mode 775 can I set autostart on. At present, there does not appear to be a workaround.  I looked into modifying VBoxManage to see what modifications I might make, but I am not a C++ programmer, and I quickly get lost in the code that manages autostart.  I can get it to work if I change the autostartdb from /etc/vbox to /etc/vbox/autostart.d/, ownership of /etc/vbox to root:root, and the mode to 755. The ownership of autostart.d is root:vboxusers with mode 1755.  I'm not sure that this helps the security. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c6)  Larry Finger   2021-04-03 04:39:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 847970](attachment.cgi?id=847970&action=diff "Patches for autostart") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=847970&action=edit "Patches for autostart") Patches for autostart  Attached is a set of patches that should make autostart as secure as possible within the current structure. These have the following effects:  1. VBOXAUTOSTART_DB is changed from /etc/vbox to /etc/vbox/autostart.d 2. /etc/vbox is now owned by root:root with mode 0755 3. /etc/vbox/autostart.d is owned by root:vboxusers with mode 1775  This setup makes it so that /etc/vbox/autostart.cfg can only be changed by root, but files /etc/vbox/autostart.d/<username>.start can be created or deleted by any user. Although users can create other files in autostart.d, nothing will ever reference files other than *.start.  Does this satisfy  the BUG? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c8)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-04-07 09:42:22 UTC  ``` The patch in [attachment 847970](attachment.cgi?id=847970&action=diff "Patches for autostart") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=847970&action=edit "Patches for autostart") should fix the full local root exploit as described in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c0). It still will be susceptible to the problems described in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c2), though.  Since the Factory package is currently broken as it seems you can try to go with the current patch to fix the situation and then lets go on from there. Please let me have a look at the package before you submit it to Factory.  To fix the aspect described in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c2) we might need to patch the vboxautostart.sh script, too. I can help you with that if you like. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c10)  Larry Finger   2021-04-07 16:44:00 UTC  ``` The updated coode is at: [https://build.opensuse.org/package/rdiff/home:lwfinger:branches:Virtualization/virtualbox?linkrev=base&rev=2](https://build.opensuse.org/package/rdiff/home%3Alwfinger%3Abranches%3AVirtualization/virtualbox?linkrev=base&rev=2)  Changes are as follows: /etx/vbox now owned by root:root mode 755 VBOXAUTOSTART_DB is now set to /etc/vbox/autostart.d. That directory is owned by root:vboxusers mode 1770. I see no reason for that directory to be executable, but it fails unless those permissions are used.  I gave it a minimal change description as I was not sure how much to disclose about the vulnerability. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c12)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-04-08 12:35:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 848123](attachment.cgi?id=848123 "hardening for vboxautostart.sh") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=848123&action=edit "hardening for vboxautostart.sh") hardening for vboxautostart.sh ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c13)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-04-08 12:36:49 UTC  ``` To fix the issue described in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c2) please integrate my suggested patch in [attachment 848123](attachment.cgi?id=848123 "hardening for vboxautostart.sh") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=848123&action=edit "hardening for vboxautostart.sh"). ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c14)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-04-08 13:23:10 UTC  ``` Regarding the patch and [comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1182918#c13), please wait with publishing this fix, I will involved Oracle security, because this is an issue in their code.

Our package maintainer(s) have setup the directory /etc/vbox with permissions of  drwxrwxr-x 2 root vboxusers 4096  8. Apr 14:33 /etc/vbox  This somehow resulted from the desire to enable the autostart feature for members of the "vboxusers" group. Members of this group should be able to create files like /etc/vbox/<username>.start to have their VMs started automatically during boot.  The way this directory was packaged in openSUSE allowed for a local root exploit, however, because members of the vboxusers group have been able to remove and create arbitrary files in /etc/vbox, including recreating /etc/vbox/vbox.cfg, which is sourced by scripts running as the root user.  A reproducer works like this:      # emulate a malicious user that is member of the vboxusers group     root# su -g vboxusers nobody     nobody$ cd /etc/vbox     # replace the original file by one that is writable by us     nobody$ cp vbox.cfg vbox.cfg.new     nobody$ rm -f vbox.cfg     nobody$ mv vbox.cfg.new vbox.cfg     # add malicious code to the configuration file     nobody$ echo "touch /root/evil" >>vbox.cfg     nobody$ exit      # start the vboxautostart service to have the malicous code executed     root# systemctl start vboxautostart.service     root# ls -lh /root/evil     -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0  2. Mär 12:14 /root/evil  The vboxautostart related files have been extracted by our maintainer(s) from the virtualbox.org distribution tarballs.  I consider this issue to be openSUSE specific, because the sticky bit was missing from the directory permissions, contrary to what the VirtualBox manual says in doc/manual/en_US/user_AdvancedTopics.xml:  ``` The directory should have write access for every user who should be able to start virtual machines automatically. Furthermore the directory should have the sticky bit set. ```  With the sticky bit set a member of the group will not be able to remove the existing "vbox.cfg" file and will not be able to modify its contents. I checked a couple of other Linux distributions and could not find this error reproduced elsewhere.

## Welcome to openSUSE Build Service

The openSUSE Build Service is the public instance of the
[Open Build Service (OBS)](https://openbuildservice.org)
used for development of the openSUSE distribution and to offer packages from same source for Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE Linux Enterprise and other distributions.

Please find further details of this service on our [wiki pages](https://wiki.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3ABuild_Service).

Users can find a special [package search interface here](https://software.opensuse.org/search). Users of any distribution can
search there for built packages for their distribution.
For developers it is an efficient place to build up groups and work together through its project model.

This instance receives weekly deployments during the openSUSE Maintenance Downtime (Thursday 08:00 - 10:00 CET) and smaller deployments on request at any time.

Message-ID: <YIbC/ejOYMYVFOPM@f195.suse.de>

Subject: virtualbox: CVE-2021-25319: missing sticky bit in openSUSE packaging
 for /etc/box allows local root exploit for members of vboxusers group

Hi,

somewhat related to CVE-2021-2264 I noticed an openSUSE specific
security issue in the openSUSE packaging for virtualbox [1]. To enable
the autostart feature in virtualbox as outlined in the upstream manual
[2] our packagers introduced a group 'vboxusers' that is granted write
access to the directory /etc/vbox as the "autostart DB". Contrary to
what the manual says the directory was not packaged with the sticky bit
set, however.

The file /etc/vbox/vbox.cfg is a configuration file for virtualbox. This
file is sourced by other virtualbox bash scripts running as root like
'vboxautostart.sh', 'vboxdrv.sh' and 'vboxweb-service.sh'. Due to the
missing sticky bit any member of the vboxusers group can replace the
/etc/vbox/vbox.cfg file by a manipulated one, allowing for full code
execution in the context of the root user once e.g. the vboxautostart
systemd service runs.

Reproducer:

    root# su -g vboxusers nobody
    nobody$ cd /etc/vbox
    nobody$ cp vbox.cfg vbox.cfg.new
    nobody$ rm -f vbox.cfg
    nobody$ mv vbox.cfg.new vbox.cfg
    nobody$ echo "touch /root/evil" >>vbox.cfg

    nobody$ exit
    root# systemctl start vboxautostart.service
    root# ls -lh /root/evil
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0  2. Mär 12:14 /root/evil

I have been looking into other distributions like Arch Linux, Fedora and
also some of the RPMs distributed on www.virtualbox.org. They all
package /etc/vbox as root:root mode 755 and are therefore not affected.

Updates for the openSUSE virtualbox packages are underway [3] that will
fix the packaging error and also move the "autostart DB" directory from
/etc/vbox to /etc/vbox/autostart.d to avoid mixing the autostart related
files with the virtualbox system configuration file in the same
directory.

Cheers

Matthias
