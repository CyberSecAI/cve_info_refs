- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sending specially crafted ARP packets to an affected device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling. This indicates that the device does not properly manage the allocation of resources when processing ARP packets, leading to resource exhaustion when crafted packets are received.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A partial denial-of-service, preventing the device to operate normally. A restart is needed to restore normal operations.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted ARP packets to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same Layer 2 network domain as the affected device. No special privileges are required.
