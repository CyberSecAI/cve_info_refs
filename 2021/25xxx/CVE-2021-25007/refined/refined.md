- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a POST parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability (SQLI).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this case, the provided proof of concept shows that a sleep function can be injected, allowing an attacker to confirm the presence of the vulnerability, which could be leveraged for more impactful attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `post.php` or `admin-post.php` endpoints with a malicious `post` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to edit posts.
