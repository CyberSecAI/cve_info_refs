Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content relates to CVE-2021-25033. The official description indicates an Open Redirect vulnerability. The wpscan.com content identifies an open redirect issue due to lack of validation of the "to" parameter, which aligns with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    - The root cause is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the `to` parameter in the `email_click` functionality. This allows an attacker to control the redirect URL.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - Open Redirect: The application redirects users to an attacker-controlled URL based on the unvalidated `to` parameter.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - An attacker can craft a malicious URL using the vulnerable parameter. When a user clicks on the link, they are redirected to a malicious site, which can be a phishing site or a site hosting malware. This allows the attacker to trick users into giving out sensitive information or installing malicious software.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the vulnerable 'to' parameter. 
    - Specifically the URL parameter `noptin_ns=email_click` is targeted

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker does not need any special capabilities or position other than being able to craft a URL and send it to a target user.

**Additional Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerable code resides within the plugin's processing of the `email_click` action.
   - The fix implemented in version 1.6.5 involves adding a key verification before redirecting using the newsletter links and also switching to using the standard WordPress post editing page, instead of a custom form editor.
    - Additionally the URL now also contains  `link_key` parameter which must match a hashed value
   - The vulnerable code is triggered when a user clicks a link in a newsletter email, with a `noptin_ns=email_click` URL parameter present.

**Summary of Extracted Information**
The CVE-2021-25033 in the Newsletter Optin Box plugin is caused by insufficient validation of the "to" parameter in the email click functionality. This leads to an open redirect vulnerability that can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware delivery. The attacker does not require any special privileges or positions to exploit this, and the vulnerability is resolved in plugin version 1.6.5. The fix involves adding a key verification before redirecting using the newsletter links and switching to the standard post editing page.
