# MNDT-2022-0037

## Description

Avaya IP Office for Windows contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability which affected version 11.1 FP2 SP1 and earlier.

## Impact

High - Exploiting the vulnerability will give a local unprivileged attacker SYSTEM level privileges.

## Exploitability

Medium - Any authenticated local user can exploit the vulnerability and an exploit is trivial to produce.

## CVE Reference

CVE-2021-25657

## Common Weakness Enumeration

CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System

Base Score: 7.8 - Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Technical Details

The installation of the agent uses the Windows Installer framework and an MSI file is cached in c:\windows\installer. An unprivileged user can trigger a repair operation, either by using the Windows Installer API or by running "msiexec.exe /fa c:\windows\installer\[XXXXX].msi".

Running a repair operation will trigger a number of file operations in the %TEMP% folder of the user triggering the repair. Some of these operations will be performed from a SYSTEM context (started via the Windows Installer service), including the execution of temporary files.

## Resolution

The issue was fixed with the 11.1 Feature Pack 2 Service Pack 2 or later July 2022 Critical Patch Update. Update to address the vulnerability.

Avaya IP Office Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2021-25657)

Original Release Date: August 25, 2022

Last Revised: August 25, 2022

Number: ASA-2022-114

Overall Severity Classification: High

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

IP Office™ Platform provides a single, stackable, scalable small business communications system that grows with your business easily and cost-effectively

A vulnerability was discovered in Avaya IP Office Admin Lite and USB Creator that could potentially allow a local user to escalate privileges. This issue has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (cve.mitre.org) identifier [CVE-2021-25657](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25657).

Avaya would like to thank Ronnie Salomonsen of Mandiant for reporting this issue.

## 2. Avaya Products affected:

For assessment and severity classification details refer to Section 3 of [Avaya's Product Vulnerability Response Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100045520).
The "Resolution" column will be updated as fixes are made available. Please reference the "Information" column for any additional information regarding the affected product.

| Product: | Version(s): | Resolution: | Information: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya IP Office | 11.1 FP2 SP1 and earlier | Upgrade to 11.1 Feature Pack 2 Service Pack 2 or later. | [IP Office 11.1.x software](https://support.avaya.com/downloads/downloads-landing.action?product_id=P0160&product_name=ip-office-platform&release_number=11.1.x&contentType=Solutions) |

**Recommended Actions for Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends following networking and
security best practices by implementing firewalls, ACLs,
physical security or other appropriate access restrictions.
Though Avaya believes such restrictions should always be in
place, risk to Avaya products and the surrounding network
from this potential vulnerability may be mitigated by
ensuring these practices are implemented until such time as
an Avaya provided product update or the recommended Avaya
action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but the System Product operating system or
application should not be modified unless the change is
approved by Avaya. Making changes that are not approved may
void the Avaya product service contract.

### CVSS Scoring and Metrics:

Avaya uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) base score and metrics as reported by the vendor for the affected component(s) or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the National Vulnerability Database. In some cases, such as where CVSS information is not available from the vendor or NIST, Avaya will calculate the CVSS base score and metrics. Customers are encouraged to calculate the Temporal and Environmental CVSS scores to determine how the vulnerability could affect their specific implementation or environment. For more information on CVSS and how the score is calculated, see
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System: Specification Document](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).

| Vulnerability | CVSSv3 Base Score | CVSSv3 Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2021-25657](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25657) | 7.8 (High) | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
