SUMMARY

A vulnerability was identiﬁed in the Automation License Manager software that could be triggered by
sending specially crafted packets to port 4410/tcp of an affected system. This could cause a denial-of-
service preventing legitimate users from using the system.

Siemens has released an update for the Automation License Manager 6 and recommends to update to
the latest version. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not,
or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to

• If remote connections are needed, limit remote access to port 4410/tcp to trusted systems only

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Automation License Manager (ALM) centrally manages license keys for various Siemens software
products. Software products requiring license keys automatically report this requirement to the ALM.
When the ALM ﬁnds a valid license key for this software, the software can be used in conformity with the
end user license agreement.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-25659

Sending specially crafted packets to port 4410/tcp of an affected system could lead to extensive
memory being consumed and as such could cause a denial-of-service preventing legitimate users
from using the system.
