# Booster for WooCommerce < 5.4.9 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in General Module

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the wcj\_delete\_role parameter before outputting back in the admin dashboard when the General module is enabled, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue

### Proof of Concept

The "General" module needs to be enabled in "Woocommerce -> Booster Settings -> Booster".
