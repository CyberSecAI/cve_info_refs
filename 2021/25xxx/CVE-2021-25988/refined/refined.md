    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') [CWE-79]"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the notifications section, which would then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the notifications. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is triggered by sending an ally request to an admin user. The attacker injects the XSS payload into the name field of their profile. When the admin views the ally request notification, the malicious script is executed.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a registered user of the application and have the ability to send an ally request to the admin user. The attacker needs to be able to change the name field of their profile with the XSS payload."

    "fixes": [
        "The vulnerability is fixed by sanitizing the user input to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. Specifically, the `name_or_email` helper function was added to sanitize the user parameter before rendering.",
