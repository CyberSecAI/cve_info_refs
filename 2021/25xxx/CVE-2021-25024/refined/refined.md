- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user input before outputting it into HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser when they interact with the vulnerable page. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ecwd_event_popup_ajax` with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.
    - Accessing the URL `wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=ecwd_event&page=ecwd_general_settings&tab=%22+accesskey%3Dx+onclick%3Dalert%281%29+p`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into either submitting a crafted form or clicking on a crafted link. No special privileges are needed.
