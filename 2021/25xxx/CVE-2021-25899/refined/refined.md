Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection present in the `AurallRECMonitor` application. User-controlled input parameters `param1` and `param2` were directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `param1` (username) parameter is used in the WHERE clause of a SELECT query, allowing injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application doesn't directly reveal the output of the injected SQL queries, making it a 'blind' vulnerability. Attackers can only infer the results based on the server's response time.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user inputs, allowing malicious SQL code to be passed to the database.
- **Insecure Coding Practices:** The code does not use prepared statements or other measures to prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can use the blind SQL injection to infer database structure and content by injecting time-based payloads and observe the application response time.
- **Database Compromise:** The attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database. Although in this case, arbitrary commands could not be executed, the full database content was exfiltrated using time based queries.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** With database access, attackers can potentially escalate attacks to other parts of the application.
- **Compromise of Multiple Instances:** The attacker was able to find multiple instances of the vulnerable application due to a predictable subdomain naming scheme used by the vendor, leading to multiple database compromises.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to the login page of the `AurallRECMonitor` application.
- **Manipulated User Input:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `param1` parameter (username field).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the login panel of the vulnerable `AurallRECMonitor` application, which in this case was exposed on the internet.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques, particularly time-based blind SQL injection.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests, including the ability to manipulate the URL parameters.
- **Optional Source Code Access:** Having access to the source code made the discovery and exploitation easier, but it was not mandatory to carry out the attack.

**Additional Details (beyond official CVE description):**

The blog post provides more context and details than a typical CVE description including:
- **Discovery Context**: The vulnerability was discovered during an infrastructure penetration test.
- **Attack Chain**: The post explains how the attacker gained access to the source code of the application which allowed for easier discovery of the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Exploitation Details**: The post describes the nature of the blind SQL injection and how it was exploited through time based payloads.
- **Impact on Multiple Instances:** It is highlighted that the same vulnerable application was running on multiple hosts belonging to different customers of the same vendor, indicating a possible supply chain attack vector.
- **Vendor Response:** The post mentions the vendor was contacted multiple times, but did not respond to the disclosure.
- **Related CVEs**: The post mentions that another CVE (CVE-2021-25898) was assigned for the hardcoded credentials in the same application.
