Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin uses the `feed_id` POST parameter without proper sanitization in a SQL statement.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89).
*  **Impact:** An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database or execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameter. This can lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, and denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `gcpf_cart_product` action.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `Exportfeed for Woocommerce Google Product Feed` plugin.
The vulnerable parameter `feed_id` is sent to  `admin-ajax.php` with `action=gcpf_cart_product`. An example of a malicious request is provided in the Proof of Concept:
`https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?security=a5e2dfc8ec&action=gcpf_cart_product&feedpath=core/ajax/wp/fetch_product_ajax.php&keywords=snake&category=&brand=&sku=&merchat_type=Google&service_name=Google&limit=0,10&q=showT&feed_id=1 AND (SELECT 2347 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Otih)`

The attacker injects `1 AND (SELECT 2347 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Otih)` in the `feed_id` parameter, which executes a `SLEEP` function to confirm the SQL injection.

The CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating Network attack vector, low complexity, High privileges required, no user interaction, changed scope, High confidentiality impact, no integrity impact, and no availability impact.

The affected plugin is `exportfeed-for-woocommerce-google-product-feed` version 1.2.4 and below.
