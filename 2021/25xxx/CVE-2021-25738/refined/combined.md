### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.

Java client for the [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) API.

## To start using Kubernetes Java Client

See the wiki page and documentation [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki).

* [Installation](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/1.-Installation)
* [Client Versioning and Compatibility](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/2.-Versioning-and-Compatibility)
* [Code Examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/3.-Code-Examples)

## Release

Starting from `20.0.0` (Kubernetes 1.28), `client-java-api` was introduced non-backward-compatible changes. Optional
parameters are now consolidated into a single object, and Java8 support has been removed. For Java8 users or those
preferring the old SDK interface, a legacy SDK module version is available with a "-legacy" suffix, like `20.0.0-legacy`.

We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:

* Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
* Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
* Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps

You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like [Chrome Incognito](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9845881?hl=en_US) mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.

To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for [key terms](privacy/key-terms?hl=en_US#key-terms). And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can [contact us](https://support.google.com/policies?p=privpol_privts&hl=en_US).

# Information Google collects

## We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services

We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which [ads you’ll find most useful](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-useful-ads), [the people who matter most to you online](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-people-online), or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.

When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with [unique identifiers](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-unique-id) tied to the browser, application, or [device](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-device) you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.

When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as [personal information](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-personal-info).

## Things you create or provide to us

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/d1b68e2cd423aba52d74f02573df2d2d.svg)

When you create a Google Account, you provide us with [personal information](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-personal-info) that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a [phone number](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-phone-number) or [payment information](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-payment-info) to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.

We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.

## Information we collect as you use our services

### Your apps, browsers & devices

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/e79ea0ed464fc8952d5b5582f9f9ae53.svg)

We collect information about the apps, browsers, and [devices](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-devices) you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.

The information we collect includes [unique identifiers](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-unique-id), browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including [IP address](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-ip), crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and [referrer URL](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-referrer-url) of your request.

We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an [Android device with Google apps](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-android-device), your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your [device type and carrier name](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9021432?hl=en_US), crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, [other information about how you’re using your Android device](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6078260?hl=en_US).

### Your activity

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/39b031d352a2e1586cf50ac7f2bbc18b.svg)

We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:

* Terms you search for
* Videos you watch
* [Views and interactions with content and ads](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-content-views)
* [Voice and audio information](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-voice-audio-information)
* Purchase activity
* People with whom you communicate or share content
* [Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-activity-on-third-party)
* Chrome browsing history you’ve [synced with your Google Account](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-chrome-sync)

If you use our [services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-calls-messages), we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.

[Go to Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/?utm_source=pp&hl=en_US)

### Your location information

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/4c5ee41d52605ff6f43538d46a1c0d35.svg)

We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.

Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:

* GPS and other [sensor data from your device](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-sensor-data)
* [IP address](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-ip)
* [Activity on Google services](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-activity-on-services), such as from your searches or [places you label like home or work](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-places-you-label)
* [Information about things near your device](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-near-device), such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices

The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can [turn your Android device’s location on or off](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_location&hl=en_US) using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on [Location History](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_lochistory&hl=en_US) if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about [how we use location information](technologies/location-data?hl=en_US).

---

In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from [publicly accessible sources](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-sources). For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to [protect against abuse](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-against-abuse). We also receive information from partners to provide [advertising and research services on their behalf](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-ad-services).

We use various technologies to collect and store information, including [cookies](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-cookies), [pixel tags](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-pixel), local storage, such as [browser web storage](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-browser-storage) or [application data caches](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-application-data-cache), databases, and [server logs](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-server-logs).

# Why Google collects data

## We use data to build better services

We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:

### Provide our services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/b18d13e9ea8a362642b7d25bce665039.svg)

We use your information to [deliver our services](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-deliver-services), like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
### Maintain & improve our services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/4165cd3aa643abb80fe1953668f67551.svg)

We also use your information to [ensure our services are working as intended](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-ensure-working), such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to [make improvements](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-make-improvements) to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
### Develop new services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/546f2b674b407304a2570e71a216e509.svg)

We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.

### Provide personalized services, including content and ads

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/51cd09d6239edc9652bc05ad1d149a5c.svg)

We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and [customized search results](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-customized-search). For example, [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?utm_source=pp&hl=en_US) provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.

Depending on your settings, we may also show you [personalized ads](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-personalized-ads) based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in [My Ad Center](https://myadcenter.google.com?hl=en_US).

* We don’t show you personalized ads based on [sensitive categories](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-sensitive-categories), such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
* We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.
* We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

[Go to My Ad Center](https://myadcenter.google.com?hl=en_US)

### Measure performance

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/a8e78fa7fa279aa946fe1a9d6a0508f2.svg)

We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to [link information](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-link-info) about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.

### Communicate with you

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/acad335ad7ba163209d8c3e671b2c445.svg)

We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.

### Protect Google, our users, and the public

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/02f8664b95445de6f27ba682f3c5f9ab.svg)

We use information to help improve the [safety and reliability](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-safety-reliability) of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or [the public](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-the-public).

---

We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us [detect abuse](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-detect-abuse) such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use [algorithms](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-algorithm) to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.

We may [use the information we collect](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-combine-info) across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, [your activity on other sites and apps](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-other-sites) may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.

If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.

We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.

# Your privacy controls

## You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used

This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the [Privacy Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup?utm_source=pp&utm_medium=Promo-in-product&utm_campaign=pp_body&hl=en_US), which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our [Product Privacy Guide](technologies/product-privacy?hl=en_US).

## Managing, reviewing, and updating your information

When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.

We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US) includes:

### Privacy controls

![](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/3394102be0315326fd760e503b31c7b6.svg)
### Activity Controls

Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether [information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/54068?hl=en_US#zippy=%2Cinfo-about-your-browsing-and-other-activity-on-sites-apps-and-devices-that-use-google-services), such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.

# Sharing your information

## When you share your information

Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.

When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in [ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_endorse&hl=en_US).

## When Google shares your information

We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:

### With your consent

We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you [use Google Home to make a reservation](https://support.google.com/googlehome?p=privpol_homedata&hl=en_US) through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to [review and manage third party apps and sites](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?hl=en_US) you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any [sensitive personal information](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-sensitive-info).

### With domain administrators

If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your [domain administrator](https://support.google.com/a?p=privpol_admin&hl=en_US) and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:

* Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
* View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
* Change your account password
* Suspend or terminate your account access
* Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
* Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings

### For external processing

We provide personal information to our [affiliates](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-affiliates) and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.

### For legal reasons

We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

* Respond to any applicable law, regulation,[legal process, or enforceable governmental request](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-legal). We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our [Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en_US).
* Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
* Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
* Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our [users](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-our-users), or the public.

We may share [non-personally identifiable information](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-info) publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to [show trends](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-trends) about the general use of our services. We also allow [specific partners](privacy?hl=en_US#footnote-specific-partners) to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.

If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

# Keeping your information secure

## We build security into our services to protect your information

All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:

* We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
* We offer a range of security features, like [Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/?utm_source=pp&hl=en_US), Security Checkup, and [2 Step Verification](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/?utm_source=pp&hl=en_US) to help you protect your account
* We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
* We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.

We’ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.
* Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as [advertising data](technologies/ads?hl=en_US) in server logs.
* We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.
* And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.

When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.

## Key terms

### Affiliates

An affiliate is an entity that belongs to the Google group of companies, including the following companies that provide consumer services in the EU: Google Ireland Limited, Google Commerce Ltd, Google Payment Corp, and Google Dialer Inc. Learn more about the [companies providing business services in the EU](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/affiliates?hl=en_US).

### Algorithm

A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.

### Application data cache

An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.

### Browser web storage

Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about [how Google uses cookies](technologies/cookies?hl=en_US) and how Google uses data, including cookies, [when you use our partners' sites or apps](technologies/partner-sites?hl=en_US).

### Device

A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.

### Google Account

You may access some of our services by signing up for a [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US) and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.

### IP address

Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about [how we use location information.](technologies/location-data?hl=en_US)

### Non-personally identifiable information

This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.

### Personal information

This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.

### Pixel tag

A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.

### Referrer URL

A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.

### Sensitive personal information

This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.

### Server logs

Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:

```
123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -
740674ce2123e969
```

* `123.45.67.89` is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
* `25/Mar/2003 10:15:32` is the date and time of the query.
* `http://www.google.com/search?q=cars` is the requested URL, including the search query.
* `Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7` is the browser and operating system being used.
* `740674ce2123a969` is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).

### Unique identifiers

A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.

Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about [how Google uses cookies](technologies/cookies?hl=en_US).

On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be [managed](technologies/ads?hl=en_US) in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.

## Additional Context

### Activity on Google Services

If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.

In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.

You can view and control your Web & App Activity at [My Activity](https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols?hl=en_US).

### activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services

Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.

This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them.

You can [learn more](technologies/partner-sites?hl=en_US) about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services.

### ads you’ll find most useful

For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more [about Google ads](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&hl=en_US) and [why you may see particular ads](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&hl=en_US).

### advertising and research services on their behalf

For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.

### Android device with Google apps

Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about [Google Play Services](https://support.google.com/android/answer/10546414?hl=en_US).

### appropriate safeguards

For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you. [Learn more](technologies/anonymization?hl=en_US)

### benefits the public

For example, we process information about [requests to remove content](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?hl=en_US) from our services to educate the public, facilitate research, and provide transparency about these requests.

### customized search results

For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can [learn more here](https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_searchactivity&hl=en_US). You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can [search and browse privately](https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_incognito&hl=en_US) or turn off [signed-out search personalization](https://www.google.com/history/optout?utm_source=pp&hl=en_US).

### Customizing our services

For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.

### data controller responsible for processing your information

This means the Google affiliate that is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.

### deliver our services

Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:

* We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
* We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
* Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, collages, and other creations that you can share. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/photos?p=privpol_manage&hl=en_US)
* A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
* When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.

### detect abuse

When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including [child sexual abuse and exploitation material](https://protectingchildren.google/?hl=en_US)), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.

### devices

For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.

### ensure and improve

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.

### ensure our services are working as intended

For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.

### Information about things near your device

If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_androidloc&hl=en_US)

### legal process, or enforceable governmental request

Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our [Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en_US).

### make improvements

For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.

### may link information

Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/analytics?p=privpol_data&hl=en_US)

### our users

For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/12158374?hl=en_US).

### partner with Google

There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_controlads&hl=en_US)

### payment information

For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.

We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_agereq&hl=en_US)

### personalized ads

You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&hl=en_US)

### phone number

If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_phone&hl=en_US)

### Places you label like home and work

You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads.

You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your [Google Account.](https://myaccount.google.com/personal-info?hl=en_US)

### protect against abuse

For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).

### publicly accessible sources

For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.

### rely on cookies to function properly

For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. [Learn more](technologies/cookies?hl=en_US#types-of-cookies)

### remove

For example, as described above, you can [request to remove content](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?visit_id=637939486089565735-343938859&hl=en_US), including content that may contain your information, from specific Google services, based on applicable law (including data protection law) and our policies.

### safety and reliability

Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:

* Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
* The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/mail?p=privpol_signinactivity&hl=en_US)

### sensitive categories

When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we [require the same from advertisers](https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy?p=privpol_p13nad&hl=en_US) that use our services.

### Sensor data from your device

Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about [how we use location information.](technologies/location-data?hl=en_US)

### servers around the world

For example, we operate data centers located [around the world](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations?hl=en_US) to help keep our products continuously available for users.

### services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages

Examples of these services include:

* Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
* Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
* Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
* Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
* Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
* Google Fi, for a phone plan

### show trends

When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/trends?p=privpol_about&hl=en_US)

### similar information related to your physical or mental health

If you use fitness products and apps we offer, such as Fitbit, Pixel Watch, Nest or Google Fit, we collect data you provide, like your height and weight. We also collect information from these apps and devices, such as your sleep patterns, heart rate, skin temperature, calories burned, and steps taken.
### specific Google services

For example, you can delete [your blog](https://support.google.com/blogger?p=privpol_blog&hl=en_US) from Blogger or [a Google Site you own](https://support.google.com/sites?p=privpol_delete&hl=en_US) from Google Sites. You can also delete [reviews](https://support.google.com/googleplay?p=privpol_review&hl=en_US) you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.

### specific partners

For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. [Learn more](privacy/google-partners?hl=en_US) about these partners and how they use your information.

### synced with your Google Account

Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/chrome?p=privpol_chrsync&hl=en_US)

### the people who matter most to you online

For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you [contact most frequently](https://contacts.google.com?hl=en_US).

### the public

For example, we process information about [requests to remove content](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?visit_id=637939486089565735-343938859&hl=en_US) from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.

### third parties

For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.

### use the information we collect across our services

Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include:

* When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_privresults&hl=en_US)
* If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=autocontacts&hl=en_US)
* The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.
* If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/googlehome?p=privpol_actions&hl=en_US)
* If you’re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.

### Views and interactions with content and ads

For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.

### Voice and audio information

For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6030020?hl=en_US#zippy=%2Chow-audio-recordings-are-saved)

### your activity on other sites and apps

This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your [account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US) and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

[Learn more](technologies/partner-sites?hl=en_US) about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Java client for the [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) API.

## To start using Kubernetes Java Client

See the wiki page and documentation [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki).

* [Installation](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/1.-Installation)
* [Client Versioning and Compatibility](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/2.-Versioning-and-Compatibility)
* [Code Examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/3.-Code-Examples)

## Release

Starting from `20.0.0` (Kubernetes 1.28), `client-java-api` was introduced non-backward-compatible changes. Optional
parameters are now consolidated into a single object, and Java8 support has been removed. For Java8 users or those
preferring the old SDK interface, a legacy SDK module version is available with a "-legacy" suffix, like `20.0.0-legacy`.

Java client for the [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) API.

## To start using Kubernetes Java Client

See the wiki page and documentation [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki).

* [Installation](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/1.-Installation)
* [Client Versioning and Compatibility](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/2.-Versioning-and-Compatibility)
* [Code Examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/3.-Code-Examples)

## Release

Starting from `20.0.0` (Kubernetes 1.28), `client-java-api` was introduced non-backward-compatible changes. Optional
parameters are now consolidated into a single object, and Java8 support has been removed. For Java8 users or those
preferring the old SDK interface, a legacy SDK module version is available with a "-legacy" suffix, like `20.0.0-legacy`.

Java client for the [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) API.

## To start using Kubernetes Java Client

See the wiki page and documentation [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki).

* [Installation](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/1.-Installation)
* [Client Versioning and Compatibility](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/2.-Versioning-and-Compatibility)
* [Code Examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/wiki/3.-Code-Examples)

## Release

Starting from `20.0.0` (Kubernetes 1.28), `client-java-api` was introduced non-backward-compatible changes. Optional
parameters are now consolidated into a single object, and Java8 support has been removed. For Java8 users or those
preferring the old SDK interface, a legacy SDK module version is available with a "-legacy" suffix, like `20.0.0-legacy`.

SECURITY-2796 / CVE-2022-38663
Git Plugin 4.11.4 and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with
asterisks) credentials in the build log provided by the Git Username and
Password (`gitUsernamePassword`) credentials binding. Usernames are masked
instead of passwords in cases when usernames are not set to be treated as
secret.

SECURITY-2765 / CVE-2022-38664
Job Configuration History Plugin 1165.v8cc9fd1f4597 and earlier does not
escape the job name on the System Configuration History page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to configure job names.

SECURITY-2157 / CVE-2022-38665
CollabNet Plugins Plugin 2.0.8 and earlier stores a RabbitMQ password
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`hudson.plugins.collabnet.share.TeamForgeShare.xml` on the Jenkins
controller as part of its configuration.

This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller
file system.

SECURITY-2448 / CVE-2021-25738
Kubernetes Continuous Deploy Plugin 2.3.1 and earlier bundles a version of
Kubernetes Java Client library with the vulnerability CVE-2021-25738 that
does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of
arbitrary types.

This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by
users able to provide YAML input files to Kubernetes Continuous Deploy
Plugin's build step.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

this is a public method, should we mark it as deprecated and keep this for 1~2 releases for backward-compatibility?

# Google Terms of Service

Effective May 22, 2024 | [Archived versions](terms/archive?hl=en_US) | [Download PDF](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20240522/ks8shls0/google_terms_of_service_en_eu.pdf)

[Country version:](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-country-version) Ireland

## What’s covered in these terms

### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_IE/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=en_US). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

* [What you can expect from us](terms?hl=en_US#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
* [What we expect from you](terms?hl=en_US#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
* [Content in Google services](terms?hl=en_US#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
* [In case of problems or disagreements](terms?hl=en_US#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms. We encourage you to download these terms for future reference. We make these terms, and all previous versions, available at all times [here](terms/archive?hl=en_US).

Besides these terms, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US). Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US).

# Terms

## Service provider

In the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

Google Ireland Limited
incorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland
(Registration Number: 368047 / VAT Number: IE6388047V)

Gordon House, Barrow Street
Dublin 4
Ireland

## Age requirements

If you’re under the [age required to manage your own Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en_US), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their [service-specific additional terms and policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US).

## Contents

[Introduction](terms?hl=en_US#toc-intro)[Your relationship with Google](terms?hl=en_US#toc-relationship)[Using Google services](terms?hl=en_US#toc-using)[Content in Google services](terms?hl=en_US#toc-content)[Software in Google services](terms?hl=en_US#toc-software)[In case of problems or disagreements](terms?hl=en_US#toc-problems)[About these terms](terms?hl=en_US#toc-about)[EEA instructions on withdrawal](terms?hl=en_US#toc-withdrawal-form)![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/your_relationship_illustration.svg)
# Your relationship with Google

These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google Ireland Limited and its [affiliates](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-affiliates). Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_IE/how-our-business-works).

## What you can expect from us

### Provide a broad range of useful services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/provide_services_illustration.svg)We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

* apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
* platforms (like Google Shopping)
* integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
* devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)

Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.

### Develop, improve, and update Google services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/improve_services_illustration.svg)

While we use a broad definition of “services” throughout these terms as described above, applicable law draws distinctions between “digital content”, “services”, and “goods” in certain situations. That’s why we use the more specific terms in this section and the [Legal guarantee](terms?hl=en_US#toc-legal-guarantee) section.

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware.

As part of the continual evolution of our digital content, services, and goods, we make modifications such as adding or removing features and functionalities, increasing or decreasing usage limits, and offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also change our digital content or services for these other reasons:

* to adapt to new technologies
* to reflect increases or decreases in the number of people who use a particular service
* to respond to key changes in the licenses and partnerships we have with others
* to prevent abuse or harm
* to address legal, regulatory, safety, or security issues

In particular, we sometimes make legally-required updates, which are modifications that keep digital content, services, or goods in conformity with the law. We make these updates to our digital content, services, and goods for safety or security reasons, and to make sure they meet the quality standards that you expect, such as those described in the [Legal guarantee](terms?hl=en_US#toc-legal-guarantee) section. We may automatically install updates that address significant safety or security risks. For other updates, you can choose whether you want them installed.

We maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons.

If a modification negatively affects your ability to access or use our digital content or services, or if we stop offering a service all together, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice by email — including a description of the changes, when they’ll take place, and your right to end your contract with us if our modifications create more than a minor negative impact — except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse or harm, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) from your Google Account using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?hl=en_US), subject to applicable law and policies.

## What we expect from you

### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/ssat_illustration.svg)The permission we give you to access and use our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) continues as long as you comply with:

* **these terms**
* **[service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US)**, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US), [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877?hl=en_US), [Safety Center](https://safety.google?hl=en_US), [Transparency Center](https://transparency.google/?hl=en_US), and other pages accessible from our [policies site](/?hl=en_US). Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we have in the services.

### Respect others

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/respect_others_illustration.svg)We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

* comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
* respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
* don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others

Our [service-specific additional terms and policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), such as our [Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy](terms/generative-ai/use-policy?hl=en_US), provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/81275?hl=en_US). If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the *[Taking action in case of problems](terms?hl=en_US#taking-action)* section.

### Don’t abuse our services

Most people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:

You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:

* introducing malware
* spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures
* jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our [safety and bug testing programs](https://bughunters.google.com/?hl=en_US)
* accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:

+ phishing
+ creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews
+ misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human
+ providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us

* providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not
* using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights
* reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law
* using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)
* using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology
* hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms
* providing services that encourage others to violate these terms

### Permission to use your content

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/permission_to_use_illustration.svg)

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content). You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

## License

[Your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that you retain any [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

* This license doesn’t affect your data protection rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
* This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
  + publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
  + feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the *[Service-related communications](terms?hl=en_US#toc-service-related-comm)* section below.

### Scope

This license is:

* worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
* non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
* royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
### Rights

This license allows Google to:

* host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
* publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
* modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it
* sublicense these rights to:
  + other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
  + our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the *[Purpose](terms?hl=en_US#toc-purpose)* section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

* **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
  + for spam, malware, and illegal content
  + to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
  + to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com?ref=ps-terms&hl=en_US))This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
* **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
* **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

### Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

* If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
* If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

# Using Google services

## Your Google Account

[If you meet these age requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en_US) you can [create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en_US) for your convenience. Some [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?hl=en_US).

## Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business

Many [organizations](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services). To use our services on behalf of an organization:

* an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
* your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.
If you’re based in the European Union, then these terms don’t affect the rights you may have as a [business user](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-business-user) of online intermediation services — including online platforms such as Google Play — under the [EU Platform-to-Business Regulation](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-eu-platform-to-business).
## Service-related communications

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US).

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/content_in_services_illustration.svg)
# Content in Google services

## Your content

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

* See the *[Permission to use your content](terms?hl=en_US#toc-permission)* section for more about your rights in [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
* See the *[Removing your content](terms?hl=en_US#toc-removing)* section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?hl=en_US) and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877?hl=en_US).

## Google content

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions?hl=en_US) page.

## Other content

Finally, some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) give you access to content that belongs to other people or [organizations](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/software_in_services_illustration.svg)
# Software in Google services

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

The license we give you is:

* worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
* non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
* royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
* personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
* non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/disagreements_illustration.svg)
# In case of problems or disagreements

Both the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. If you’re a [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), then you enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law, as well as any additional rights provided under these terms or [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US).

## Legal guarantee

If you’re an EEA-based [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), and you’ve agreed to our Terms of Service, then EEA consumer laws provide you with a [legal guarantee](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-legal-guarantee) covering the digital content, services, or goods that we provide you. Under this guarantee, we’re [liable](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) for any [lack of conformity](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-lack-conformity) that you discover:

* within two years of the delivery of goods (such as a phone) or the one-time supply of digital content or services (such as purchasing a movie)
* at any time during the “continuous” supply of digital content or services (such as Maps or Gmail)

Your national laws may provide an even longer guarantee. Your rights under these legal guarantees aren’t limited by any other [commercial guarantees](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-commercial-guarantee) that we provide. If you want to make a guarantee claim, please [contact us](https://about.google/contact-google/?hl=en_US).

## Liabilities

### For all users

These terms don’t limit [liability](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) for:

* fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation
* death or personal injury caused by negligence
* gross negligence
* willful misconduct

Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), subject to applicable law.

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-business-user) or [organization](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization):

* To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll [indemnify](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.
* If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
* Google won’t be responsible for the following [liabilities](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability):
  + loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
  + indirect or consequential loss
  + punitive damages
* Except as stated in the *[For all users](terms?hl=en_US#for-all)* section above, Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) €500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.

## Taking action in case of problems

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

* cause harm or [liability](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
* violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
* compromise an investigation
* compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Without limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

* you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US)
* we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
* we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this [Help Center page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en_US). If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en_US).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you’re an EEA-based [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), you can also [withdraw from these terms](terms?hl=en_US#toc-withdrawal-form) within 14 days of accepting them. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback/intl/en/?hl=en_US) so that we can continue improving our services.

## Handling requests for your data

Respect for the privacy and security of your data underpins our approach to responding to data disclosure requests. When we receive data disclosure requests, our team reviews them to make sure they satisfy legal requirements and Google’s [data disclosure policies](terms/information-requests?hl=en_US). Google Ireland Limited accesses and discloses data, including communications, in accordance with the laws of Ireland, and EU law applicable in Ireland. For more information about the data disclosure requests that Google receives worldwide, and how we respond to such requests, see our [Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com?hl=en_US) and [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US).

## Settling disputes, governing law, and courts

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact?hl=en_US).

If you’re a resident of, or an [organization](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization) based in, the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, these terms and your relationship with Google under these terms and [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), are governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you can file legal disputes in your local courts. If you’re an EEA-based [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), please [contact us](https://google.com/contact?hl=en_US) to resolve issues directly. The European Commission also offers an [Online Dispute Resolution platform](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr), but Google isn’t legally required to use this or other alternative dispute resolution platforms.

# About these terms

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

### Right of withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.

The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.

To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail).

If you use this option, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a withdrawal on a durable medium (e.g. by e-mail) without delay.

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

### Effects of withdrawal

If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.
