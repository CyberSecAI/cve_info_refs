{
  "CVE-2021-25738": {
    "Description": "The Kubernetes Java client library is vulnerable to code execution via specially crafted YAML input, due to insecure YAML parsing. This can be exploited by an attacker providing malicious YAML input.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the Kubernetes Java client library's YAML parser not being configured to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This allows an attacker to construct a malicious YAML document that, when parsed, could trigger arbitrary code execution.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure deserialization via YAML parsing"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on a vulnerable system by providing malicious YAML input, allowing them to potentially take control of the affected application or server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation occurs through the processing of untrusted YAML input by the Kubernetes Java client library."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply malicious YAML content to be processed by the vulnerable client library.  This can occur when the application loads Kubernetes configuration files or resource definitions directly without sanitizing the input.",
     "Affected versions": [
      "Kubernetes Java Client == v11.0.0",
      "Kubernetes Java Client <= v10.0.1",
      "Kubernetes Java Client <= v9.0.2"
    ],
     "Patched versions": [
       "Kubernetes Java Client >= v12.0.0",
        "Kubernetes Java Client >= v11.0.1"
    ],
      "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is resolved by updating the `CustomConstructor` class in SnakeYAML library to prevent instantiation of arbitrary types. There is also a code referencing feature to assist users in finding relevant open-source licenses when using code suggestions from AI tools."
