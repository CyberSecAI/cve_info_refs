## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# AGIL <= 1.0 - Admin+ Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin accepts all zip files and automatically extracts the zip file without validating the extracted file type. Allowing high privilege users such as admin to upload an arbitrary file like PHP, leading to RCE

### Proof of Concept

As an admin, set a base folder name(for example, test), upload a zipped PHP file via the Grid Image Listing page of the plugin (https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=automatic\_grid\_image\_listing).
The file will be located at https://example.com/wp-content/test/<filename.php>
