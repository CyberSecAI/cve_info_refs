Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25966:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `www.mend.io_07f1b46f_20250115_225612.html` and `www.whitesourcesoftware.com_479dada3_20250115_225610.html` directly references CVE-2021-25966 and provides vulnerability details, hence this content is relevant. Other files are not related to the CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper session termination after a password change in "Orchard Core CMS". The application does not invalidate existing user sessions when a user's password is changed.

*   **Weakness:** Insufficient session expiration (CWE-613).

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A user whose password has been changed (either by themselves or an admin) remains logged in with the old credentials, allowing them to continue accessing the application with the old password and permissions.

*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based.

*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the password change, as this can be done by an admin user or by the user themselves.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of an active valid session, and of a user that will have their password changed.
    *   The attacker has access to the application over the network.
    *   The attacker needs to wait for the password to be changed by an admin or the user themselves to trigger this issue.
   *   User interaction is required for successful exploitation.

*   **Vulnerable Versions**: Orchard Core CMS versions 1.0.0-beta1-3383 to 1.0.0.

*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC involves two users: Alice (a regular user) and Admin (an administrator).
    1.  Alice logs into the application.
    2.  Admin logs into the application in a separate browser and changes Alice's password.
    3.  Alice, still logged in the previous browser session with the old credentials, can continue to access the application as normal.

*   **Remediation:** Invalidate user sessions upon password change. The maintainer did not provide a fix.

*   **CVSS Score:**
    *   **CVSS v3.1:** 8.8 (High)
        *   AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:R, S:U, C:H, I:H, A:H
    *   **CVSS v2:** 6.5 (Medium)
        *   AV:N, AC:L, AU:S, C:P, I:P, A:P
*   **Language:** C#

* **Additional notes:** The information from Mend.io notes that no fix was provided by the maintainer.
