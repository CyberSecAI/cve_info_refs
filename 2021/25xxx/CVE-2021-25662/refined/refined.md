Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-25662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of exceptional conditions in the SmartVNC client. Specifically, the client fails to handle an exception properly if the program execution process is modified after receiving a packet from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper exception handling in the SmartVNC client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious packet from the server to the client.
- The attack vector is network-based, as it involves communication between the SmartVNC server and client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send packets to the affected SmartVNC client.
- The attacker needs to have a position from which they can interact with the server and/or client (depending on the specific attack path).
- The attack complexity is considered high due to the need to modify the program execution process after sending a packet.
- It is also mentioned that the attacker needs to have low privileges.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability is specific to the client side of the SmartVNC implementation.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple Siemens SIMATIC HMI and WinCC products.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.9.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions).
