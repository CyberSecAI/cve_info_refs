{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks in the `ive_save_general_settings` AJAX action.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing authorization and CSRF checks, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Any authenticated user, including subscribers, can modify the plugin's settings by exploiting the missing authorization. This allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code, which is then executed in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to various attacks like session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through an AJAX request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` using the `ive_save_general_settings` action with a malicious JavaScript payload in `ive_custom_js` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber privileges."
