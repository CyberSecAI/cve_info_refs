The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository. It shows changes to two files: `modules/@apostrophecms/i18n/index.js` and `modules/@apostrophecms/task/index.js`.

The changes are related to how the `req.session` object is handled within these modules. Specifically, the commit addresses an issue where the `req.session` object might not always exist, especially within the context of tasks. The changes add checks to ensure that `req.session` exists before attempting to access its properties and ensures the session object exists in task requests.

Here's a breakdown:

**modules/@apostrophecms/i18n/index.js:**

*   **Root Cause:** The code was directly accessing `req.session.aposCrossDomainClipboard` without checking if `req.session` exists. This could lead to errors if the session was not available.
*   **Vulnerability:** Potential for a crash or error if the session object was undefined.
*   **Impact:** The application could fail or behave unexpectedly when dealing with cross-domain clipboard operations.
*   **Attack Vector:** Not a direct exploit but a coding error.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Not applicable.

**modules/@apostrophecms/task/index.js:**

*   **Root Cause:** Task requests were not guaranteed to have a session object.
*   **Vulnerability:** Task requests could fail if they relied on a session object that didn't exist.
*   **Impact:** Tasks could break, leading to incomplete operations or errors.
*   **Attack Vector:** Not a direct exploit but a coding error.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Not applicable.

**Summary of changes:**

*   In `modules/@apostrophecms/i18n/index.js`, the code is changed from `req.session.aposCrossDomainClipboard` to `req.session && req.session.aposCrossDomainClipboard` to handle cases where `req.session` is not defined. This adds a check before accessing the property.
*   In `modules/@apostrophecms/task/index.js`, a `session: {}` is added to ensure that task requests have a session object.

**Relevance to CVE-2021-25979:**

Based on the provided content, there is no direct mention of a specific vulnerability or exploit related to CVE-2021-25979. However, the changes being made in the commit are related to handling session objects which could potentially be related to security in other aspects. The fix ensures that operations are handled more robustly, especially in situations where the session may not exist. This is a preventative measure to avoid crashes and incorrect behavior related to missing session properties.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify CVE-2021-25979, the code fix addresses potential issues that *could* lead to vulnerabilities if unaddressed. However, without further context linking the changes directly to the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-25979, this is not sufficient to assume it is the correct fix.

**Conclusion:**

The content provides a code fix for an issue where the `req.session` object might be undefined. This addresses a potential crash and general instability and appears to be a bug fix. However, there is no direct information to suggest this change is related to CVE-2021-25979.

**Final Answer:** NOINFO
