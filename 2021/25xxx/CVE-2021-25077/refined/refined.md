Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The plugin failed to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input from the `tab` parameter in the URL. This parameter is used to dynamically include template files, which, combined with missing sanitization, leads to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting flaw. The plugin takes the `tab` parameter from the URL and outputs it unsanitized within an error message.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin uses the `$_GET['tab']` parameter directly without sanitizing it before using it in a `sprintf` function and to load template files, which leads to the injection point. The vulnerable code also uses `$_GET['paged']` and `$_GET['action']`, and `$_POST['action']` without proper sanitization, as well as other occurrences of `~~` casting to int that have been removed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable page, which is then executed in the victim's browser.
*   This could lead to a variety of malicious actions such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious sites
    *   Stealing sensitive data
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted URL.
*   The attacker needs to lure a user, typically an administrator, to click a malicious URL. The URL includes the malicious payload in the `tab` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload in the `tab` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing this crafted URL.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided PoC: `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=woo_st&tab=%3Cimg+src+onerror%3Dalert%281%29%3E`  demonstrates how to inject JavaScript using the `tab` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) issue.
*   The CVSS score is **7.5 (High)**.
*   The fix for the vulnerability involved sanitizing the `tab` parameter using `sanitize_text_field()` and `esc_attr()` functions to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
