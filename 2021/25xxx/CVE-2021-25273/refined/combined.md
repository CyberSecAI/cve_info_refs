3 May 2021

[Note: this post was updated on 15 July 2021 to correct the omission of two resolved issues, on 20 July to advise of potential hardware compatibility issues, and again on 29 July to update a CVE reference]

| **Email protection features in this release depend on CPU features introduced by Intel and AMD 10-15 years ago.**  **SG-series appliances and many older end-of-life Sophos appliance models are not affected. Devices running on KVM/QEMU or on hardware with older CPUs may experience issues - consult [this article](https://support.sophos.com/support/s/article/KB-000042345?language=en_US) before upgrading.** |
| --- |

Today we've released UTM 9.706. The release will be rolled out in phases.

* In phase 1 you can download the update package from our [download server](https://download.astaro.com/UTM/v9/up2date/).
* In phase 2 we will make it available via our Up2Date servers in several stages.
* In phase 3 we will make it available via our Up2Date servers to all remaining installations.

## Up2Date Information

### News

* Maintenance Release
* Strict TCP Session Handling enabled by default

  New installations of UTM 9.706 have strict TCP session handling enabled by default.
  When updating to 9.706 and strict TCP session handling is not enabled, admins can enable it under Network Protection > Firewall > Advanced.
* Secure Up2Date

  Up2Date updates will be downloaded via HTTPS connections. In cases where UTM 9 is being used with an upstream proxy or behind a different firewall, it may be necessary to change the configuration on these devices to allow UTM 9 to retrieve Up2Date information via HTTPS.
* Email Protection anti-spam engine changed to Sophos Anti-Spam Interface (SASI)

  Starting with this release, E-Mail Protection will use the Sophos Anti-Spam Interface (SASI) for anti-spam scanning. SASI is already being used as part of Sophos Email and will replace the currently used anti-spam engine in UTM 9.
  In case of false positive or false negative detections, please follow the instructions in [this support article](https://support.sophos.com/support/s/article/KB-000033422) on how to submit a sample.

### Remarks

* System will be rebooted
* Configuration will be upgraded
* Connected REDs will perform firmware upgrade
* Connected Wifi APs will perform firmware upgrade

  Over the last 8 hours, 9.705009 was automatically uploaded to many of my clients, but 9.706009 was not.

  Cheers - Bob

  Are there some more information about the SASI-Enginge and possible implications available? Are there any known changes in user experience?

  BTW: currently running several machines exim patch 9.705-7 with no problems till now. Thanks

  With the new firmware version UTM 9.706-9 the Exim engine is upgraded to a newer version.
  After applying this u2d package and then rebooting, the mail attachments were transferred cleanly again.
  This solved the problem for us.

  Have upgraded two appliances to UTM 9.706-8 and am now having issues with partially corrupted mail attachments in incoming as well as outgoing mail. I don't know if this is specific to us, but have opened a support ticket as a precaution.

  I just saw that UTM 9.706-9 has been released. I will update to it and see if the problem persists.

usd-2021-0032 | SUSE CVE Database (suse.com)

============================================

Advisory ID: usd-2021-0032

Affected Product: SUSE CVE database

Vulnerability Type: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page
Generation (,Cross-site Scripting')

Security Risk: High

Vendor URL:  <<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/>>
<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/>

Vendor Status: Fixed

Suse's CVE database embedded third-party contents without sufficient
filtering and/or encoding. Multiple incidents have been identified where
Suse embedded untrusted <script> tags, resulting in stored
Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS).

Proof of Concept (PoC)

======================

In order to exploit the vulnerability, a new CVE record must be published
officially. This CVE record can contain arbitrary text as a "description".
Here, JavaScript code can injected. The SUSE CVE database imports this data
automatically and displays the information on a website. The injected code
will be executed automatically.

An example CVE containing an HTML <script> tag is CVE-2021-32718 (
<<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32718.html>>
<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32718.html>). Here, the HTML tag
was interpreted and potentially malicious JavaScript code which could follow
here would have been executed.

The following screenshots illustrate that the <script> tag was embedded
without any encoding or filtering and interpreted as markup by the browser
accordingly:

usd-2021-0006 | ChronoEngine ChronoForms v7

===========================================

Advisory ID: usd20210006

Affected Product: ChronoEngine ChronoForms v7

Affected Version: v7.0.7

Vulnerability Type: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a
Restricted Directory (,Path Traversal')

Security Risk: Medium

Vendor URL:  <<https://www.chronoengine.com/chronoforms>>
<https://www.chronoengine.com/chronoforms>

Vendor Status: Unknown

The ChronoForms function to download form input logs is vulnerable through
path traversal attacks. This allows an attacker with administration
permissions to download arbitrary files from web servers filesystem.

The parameter `fname` passed to the log script in the Joomla administration
interface is not filtered for path traversal. This allows an attacker with
administration permissions to download arbitrary files from the web servers
filesystem, like for instance Joomla's configuration file containing secret
credentials.

Proof of Concept (PoC)

======================

Open the vulnerable file in a Webbrowser:
<<https://%3cJoomlaInstallation%3e/administrator/index.php?option=com_chronof>
orms7&cont=logs&act=file&fname=%3clocal_file>
https://<JoomlaInstallation>/administrator/index.php?option=com_chronoforms7
&cont=logs&act=file&fname=<local_file>

usd-2021-0007 | ChronoEngine ChronoForums

=========================================

Advisory ID: usd20210007

Affected Product: ChronoEngine ChronoForums

Affected Version: v2.0.11

Vulnerability Type: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a
Restricted Directory (,Path Traversal')

Security Risk: High

Vendor URL:  <<https://www.chronoengine.com/chronoforums>>
<https://www.chronoengine.com/chronoforums>

Vendor Status: Unknown

The ChronoForums avatar function is vulnerable through unauthenticated path
traversal attacks. This enables unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary
files, like for instance Joomla's configuration file containing secret
credentials.

The ChronoForums avatar function is vulnerable through path traversal
attacks. An attacker can pass arbitrary local file paths as 'av' parameter.
The content of the file is returned. Unauthenticated attackers could use
this vulnerability to read arbitrary files, like for instance Joomla's
configuration file containing secret credentials.

Proof of Concept (PoC)

======================

Open the vulnerable file in a webbrowser:
<<https://%3cJoomlaInstallation%3e/index.php/component/chronoforums2/profiles>
/avatar/u1?tvout=file&av=%3clocal_file>
https://<JoomlaInstallation>/index.php/component/chronoforums2/profiles/avat

usd-2020-0106 (CVE-2021-25273) | Sophos UTM

===========================================

Advisory ID: usd-2020-0106

CWE ID: CVE-2021-25273

Affected Product: Sophos UTM

Affected Version: < UTM 9.706

Vulnerability Type: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page
Generation (,Cross-site Scripting')

Security Risk: Medium

Vendor URL:  <<https://sophos.com>> <https://sophos.com>

Vendor Status: Fixed

Sophos UTM offers a web interface to manage quarantined mails. The web-based
interface did not filter user controlled inputs sufficiently, resulting in
multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Sophos UTM is a
firewall solution by Sophos. It implements a web interface that allows
authenticated users to manage quarantined mails. Additionally, users can
inspect the contents of mails.

Sophos UTM failed to sanitize the following contents of mails before
reflecting them within the web interface:

* subject

* filename(s) of attached file(s)

* sender's name

* mail body (actual contents)

Proof of Concept (PoC)

======================

1. Send an e-mail that purposely is sent to quarantine by Sophos UTM. This
can be for instance achieved by including the "Generic Test for Unsolicited
Bulk Email" (GTUBE) test string. Additionally, include the following markup:

```

<iframe src="asd">

<img src="x:gif" onerror="alert('asd')"></img>

```

2. Access the SMTP quarantine interface and display the detail view of the
previously sent e-mail.

3. Observe that the XSS payload is executed within Sophos UTM's origin.
