  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by unsanitized parameters in the password reset functionality of OpenCRX.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary javascript code on any user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a javascript payload in the `id` parameter of the password reset link.",
       "The malicious link needs to be presented to the victim who needs to click on it."
   ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and persuade the target user to click the link. The user needs to be logged in to the application or can be forced to do so."
