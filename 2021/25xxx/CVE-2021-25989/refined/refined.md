RELATED: CVE-2021-25989

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the markdown editor.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a victim, specifically a leader of a group, views the group's edit page. This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the victim to a malicious site, or perform other actions within the context of the victim's session.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is through the group edit page, which uses a markdown editor that does not properly sanitize input.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to be able to create a group or have access to edit a group and add the victim as a leader to exploit this vulnerability. They must also be able to inject malicious code into the markdown editor. The attacker must have an account and be authenticated to the application.
