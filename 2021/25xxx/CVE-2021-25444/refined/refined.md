Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25444:

**Verification:**

The content directly references `SVE-2021-21948 (CVE-2021-25444)` as "IV reuse in Keymaster TA", confirming that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an IV (Initialization Vector) reuse issue within the Keymaster Trusted Application (TA).
*   **Weakness:** The Keymaster TA allows the decryption of a custom keyblob, a piece of encrypted data that stores cryptographic keys, if the same IV is used.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with a compromised privileged process could exploit this IV reuse to decrypt the custom keyblob. This can lead to compromising the device's stored cryptographic keys and thus data.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack requires a compromised privileged process within the device.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to gain a foothold on the device and compromise a privileged process to initiate the decryption using reused IVs.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects devices running Android O(8.1), P(9.0), and Q(10.0).
*   **Mitigation:** The patch prevents reusing IVs by blocking the addition of custom IVs.

| **Root Cause**           | IV reuse vulnerability in Keymaster TA.                                                                                                                |
| **Weakness**            | Allows decryption of a custom keyblob if the same IV is reused.                                                                                            |
| **Impact**              | Compromise of stored cryptographic keys by decrypting keyblobs.                                                                                       |
| **Attack Vectors**       | Requires a compromised privileged process.                                                                                                                |
| **Attacker Capabilities** | Must be able to compromise a privileged process on the device, and be able to trigger the keyblob decryption.                                                 |
| **Affected Versions**    | Android O(8.1), P(9.0), and Q(10.0).                                                                                                                       |
| **Mitigation**          | The patch blocks the addition of custom IVs, preventing reuse.                                                                                                                                        |
