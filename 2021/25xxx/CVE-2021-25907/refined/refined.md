- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A double drop of an object occurs when a user-provided function `f` panics within the `util::{mutate, mutate2}` functions. This happens because the affected versions of the crate did not properly handle panics while temporarily duplicating an object's ownership using `ptr::read()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is a lack of panic safety in the `mutate` and `mutate2` functions. Specifically, when a user-provided function `f` panics, the code can attempt to drop the same object multiple times because of the way ownership is temporarily handled using `ptr::read()`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Dropping the same object twice can lead to memory corruption. This can potentially cause a crash, denial of service, or potentially other security issues depending on the nature of the corrupted memory.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a user-provided function that causes a panic during execution of `util::{mutate, mutate2}`. The attack vector is network as indicated in the CVSS score.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, they simply need to trigger the execution of code where a user-provided function passed to `util::{mutate, mutate2}` panics.
