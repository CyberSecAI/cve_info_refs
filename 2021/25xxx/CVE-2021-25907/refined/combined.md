Patched

* `>=0.9.11`

### Description

Upon panic in a user-provided function `f`, `fn mutate()` & `fn mutate2` drops twice a same object.

Affected versions of this crate did not guard against double drop while temporarily duplicating an object's ownership with `ptr::read()`.

Dropping a same object can result in memory corruption.

The flaw was corrected in version "0.9.11" by fixing the code to abort upon panic.
