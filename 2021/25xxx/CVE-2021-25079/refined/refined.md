{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape various parameters before outputting them back in the admin page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-controlled input parameters such as 'form_id', 'status', 'end_date', 'order', 'orderby', and 'search' when rendering the admin page.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin page which can be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP GET requests to the admin page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=vxcf_leads`). The vulnerable parameters are appended to the URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick an administrator into accessing the link. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, but the malicious script will only execute in the context of an administrator session."
