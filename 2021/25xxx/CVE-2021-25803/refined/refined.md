Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow during size calculation within the AVI demuxer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Integer Overflow:** An integer overflow occurs during the calculation of the buffer size required for processing an AVI file. This leads to an incorrect size value.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The incorrect size calculation results in a buffer overflow, as a smaller buffer is allocated than is needed to hold the data.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A buffer overflow can lead to:
*   **Crash:** The application may crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In more severe cases, an attacker could potentially overwrite memory with malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious AVI File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted AVI file.
*   **User Interaction:** A user would need to open or play the malicious AVI file using a vulnerable version of the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Crafting a Malicious File:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious AVI file that exploits the integer overflow vulnerability.
*   **Victim Lures:** The attacker needs to lure a victim into opening the crafted AVI file with a vulnerable version of the software.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided information indicates that this vulnerability was reported by Zhen Zhou from NSFOCUS Security Team.
*   The vulnerability is located within the `avi` demuxer component of the software.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in commit `a4b1de184faf86617b4432954c1984e0027fb246`, and the commit `56cbe9c4` is a cherry-pick of that fix.
