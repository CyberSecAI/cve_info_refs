- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unquoted service path vulnerability exists in the HitmanPro.Alert (HMPA) component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unquoted service path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with administrator privileges could prevent the HMPA service from starting, despite tamper protection.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required, and the attacker must have administrator privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local attacker with administrator privileges.
