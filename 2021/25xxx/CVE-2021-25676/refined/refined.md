Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper restriction on excessive authentication attempts via SSH.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The devices fail to adequately handle a large number of failed SSH authentication attempts. Specifically, multiple failed attempts trigger a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. The device reboots automatically, causing service interruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network via SSH. The attack has low complexity and does not require any privileges or user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send SSH authentication requests to the affected device. They do not need any existing credentials or access.
