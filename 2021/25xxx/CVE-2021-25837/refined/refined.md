{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When executing an EVM transaction with multiple messages, if one message fails after a previous message has succeeded, the storage data in CommitStateDB and the code are not properly rolled back. This can lead to 'bad data points' from the failed transaction being reused in subsequent transactions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The CommitStateDB does not correctly handle rollbacks when multiple messages within a transaction do not all succeed. This leads to data inconsistencies and potentially incorrect transaction execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Subsequent transactions may use incorrect data from a partially failed previous transaction, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, incorrect application state and possibly exploitation.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft transactions with multiple messages designed to exploit this rollback issue, causing data corruption and potentially influencing later transactions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create and submit transactions containing multiple messages. They do not need any special access or privileged position."
