- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape the `course_id` parameter before outputting it in the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by an administrator. This can lead to various malicious actions including session hijacking, defacement or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a script in the `course_id` parameter and tricking an admin user into clicking it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the malicious payload. No authentication is required to inject the payload, however an administrator needs to be tricked into executing the payload.
