- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CELL files, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could trigger a crash and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution or data extraction by exploiting the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application reads a malicious CELL file. The user needs to be tricked into opening a malicious file with the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious CELL file and convince a user to open it with the vulnerable application. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the system.
