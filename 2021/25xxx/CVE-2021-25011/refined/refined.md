### Root cause of vulnerability
The WP Google Map plugin, prior to version 1.8.1, lacked proper authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for its AJAX actions.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Missing authorization:**  The plugin did not verify if the user performing AJAX actions had the necessary privileges to perform those actions. This allowed any authenticated user, including subscribers with minimal permissions, to execute administrative actions.
- **Missing CSRF protection:** The plugin did not implement CSRF protection, which makes it possible for an attacker to trick a logged-in user into unknowingly making malicious requests.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Arbitrary post deletion:** A low-privileged attacker (e.g., a subscriber) could delete any post on the WordPress site.
- **Plugin settings update:**  A low-privileged attacker could modify the plugin settings, potentially leading to further malicious activity, such as injecting malicious API keys or modifying the plugin's behavior to their advantage.

### Attack vectors
- **AJAX actions:** The vulnerabilities are present in AJAX actions, which are accessed through the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **POST requests:** The vulnerable actions are triggered by sending POST requests to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with specific `action` parameters, and other parameters for specific actions such as post id for delete or configuration values.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site, even a low-privileged one like a subscriber.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- No other special capabilities or positioning are required.

The provided content also includes the changeset that introduced the fix, which adds `current_user_can('administrator')` checks before executing the vulnerable functions. This ensures that only administrators can perform the actions.
