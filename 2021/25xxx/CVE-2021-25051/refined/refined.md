Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `Modal Window` plugin's improper handling of user-supplied input on the admin menu page, specifically within the `wow-company` admin page. It allows the inclusion of arbitrary files using the `include()` function. The plugin accepts an external URL as a parameter to load a file via the `tab` parameter, enabling a malicious actor to load and execute remote PHP code if the PHP setting `allow_url_include` is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include and execute remote files, or even files via `data://` protocol, due to the lack of sanitization of the URL provided in the `tab` parameter.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The vulnerability can be exploited through a CSRF attack, as an attacker could trick an administrator into visiting a malicious URL, which then triggers the vulnerable code.
*  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input it receives via the `tab` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site.
*   **Full Site Takeover:** An attacker can use the RCE to potentially gain complete control of the WordPress website, including access to databases, files, and other sensitive data.
*   **Malware Injection/Defacement:** The attacker can inject malicious scripts, deface the website, or use the site as a platform for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerable code is triggered via an HTTP GET request to the WordPress admin page (`/wp-admin/admin.php`).
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:**  The attacker manipulates the `tab` parameter in the URL to point to their malicious PHP file.
* **CSRF:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when visited by an authenticated admin user, will execute the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Target Must Have Vulnerable Plugin Installed:** The attacker needs the `Modal Window` plugin (versions prior to 5.2.2) to be installed on the target WordPress site.
*   **Admin Access:** Although the vulnerability can be triggered by a CSRF attack, the target user has to be an administrator of the WordPress site, since the vulnerable code is inside the admin section.
*   **`allow_url_include` must be enabled**:  The server hosting the WordPress site must have the PHP setting `allow_url_include` set to "On" to allow remote file inclusion.

**Additional Information:**

* The provided links show the fix for the vulnerability in version 5.2.2, which involves sanitizing the input and preventing the inclusion of remote URLs.
* The researcher who identified the vulnerability is Krzysztof ZajÄ…c.
* The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.4 (High).
