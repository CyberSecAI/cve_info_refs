- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `ccpw_setpage` parameter before outputting it on pages where the `[ccpw_currencies_with_price]` shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to various malicious actions like stealing user cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:**  By crafting a URL that includes the `ccpw_setpage` parameter with malicious JavaScript code, and then tricking a user into clicking the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and get a user to visit that URL. No authentication is needed.
