    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The Dolibarr application fails to validate the uniqueness of login names when an administrator modifies user details. Specifically, when renaming a user's login, the application does not check if the new login name already exists, leading to a collision.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper Authentication (CWE-287)",
        "Improper Access Control (CWE-284)"
      ],
      "impact": "Complete account takeover of the victim user. The password of the victim user is overwritten, allowing the attacker to gain access to the victim's account.",
      "attack_vector": "Network",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have administrative privileges within the Dolibarr application.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because when an admin changes a user's 'Login' name, the system does not validate whether that login name already exists. The system overwrites the password if an existing login name is used, leading to account takeover. A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using three users (admin, test, and ron). By changing the 'Login' field of the 'test' user to 'ron', the 'ron' user's password will be overwritten."
