- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate, sanitize, and escape the `redirect_to` parameter before using it to redirect the user. This occurs when the "Rename Login Page" feature is active. The redirection can happen through a Location header or a meta url attribute.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary Redirect and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect users to a malicious site (Arbitrary Redirect) or execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser (Reflected XSS).

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `redirect_to` parameter in the URL, specifically on the renamed login page.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the renamed login page URL, and the user must be logged in. The login page URL is intended to be hard to guess, which mitigates the risk.
