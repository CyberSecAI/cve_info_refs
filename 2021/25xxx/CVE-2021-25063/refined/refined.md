  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `tab` parameter before outputting it back in an admin page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin page, potentially leading to actions performed on behalf of the administrator (such as data theft, session hijacking, or defacement).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with the `tab` parameter containing the malicious payload. The user needs to click this crafted link.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince an authenticated administrator to click on a malicious URL."
