Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-25636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper certificate validation process in LibreOffice when handling digital signatures in ODF documents and macros.
- The issue occurs when the `KeyInfo` tag in the `documentsignatures.xml` or `macrosignatures.xml` stream contains both `X509Data` and `KeyValue` children.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Certificate Validation:** LibreOffice incorrectly prioritizes `KeyValue` for verification while reporting the unrelated `X509Data` value. This creates an inconsistency in validation, potentially misleading the user about the actual certificate used for signing.
- **Ambiguous KeyInfo children:** The presence of both `X509Data` and `KeyValue` within the `KeyInfo` tag is not correctly handled, leading to the validation flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could create a malicious, digitally signed ODF document.
- When a user opens this document, LibreOffice would falsely report the signature as valid, based on the manipulated `X509Data`, while actually verifying with `KeyValue` which could be arbitrary.
- This could mislead users into believing a document is safe and unaltered, when it is not.
- Could lead to the execution of malicious macros.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can create specially crafted ODF documents, where they manipulate the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream.
- This crafted document would contain both "X509Data" and "KeyValue" children under the "KeyInfo" tag.
- The user opens the malicious document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need the ability to create or modify ODF documents.
- They need to be able to manipulate the `documentsignatures.xml` or `macrosignatures.xml` stream within ODF files.
- They need to be able to include both `X509Data` and `KeyValue` elements within the `KeyInfo` tag in the aforementioned XML streams.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix implemented in LibreOffice versions 7.2.5 and 7.3.0 addresses the vulnerability by configuring certificate validation to only consider `X509Data` children. This limits validation to only X509 certificates.
- The vulnerability allowed an attacker to spoof the certificate that a signature was made with, without breaking the signature itself, thus allowing a malicious macro to appear to be signed by a trusted party.
- This vulnerability was discovered and reported by NDS of Ruhr University Bochum.
