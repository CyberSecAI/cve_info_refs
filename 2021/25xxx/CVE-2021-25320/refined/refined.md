  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Cloud credentials were not being properly validated through the Rancher API, specifically through a proxy designed to communicate with cloud providers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of cloud credentials",
      "Improper access control"

    "impact": "Any logged-in Rancher user aware of a valid cloud credential ID could use it to call the cloud provider's API through the proxy API, potentially gaining unauthorized access to cloud resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the proxy API with a known cloud credential ID"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
      "Valid Rancher user account",
      "Knowledge of a valid cloud-credential ID for a specific cloud provider"
