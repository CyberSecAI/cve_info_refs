Kube-proxy
 on Windows can unintentionally forward traffic to local processes 
listening on the same port (“spec.ports[*].port”) as a LoadBalancer 
Service when the LoadBalancer controller
 does not set the “status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip” field. Clusters 
where the LoadBalancer controller sets the 
“status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip” field are unaffected.
