- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not verify the CSRF nonce when removing posts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can make a logged-in administrator remove arbitrary posts from the blog, sending them to the trash.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint, which an attacker can induce a logged-in administrator to trigger.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious site or click on a malicious link to trigger the crafted request.
