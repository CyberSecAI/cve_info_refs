The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the Learning Management System version 1.0: an arbitrary file upload vulnerability and an SQL injection vulnerability. While the content is not directly related to a specific CVE, it does contain valuable vulnerability information.

**Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability:**
*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `lms\student_avatar.php` file, which allows arbitrary file uploads.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious scripts (webshell), to the server.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker uploads a malicious file through the vulnerable `student_avatar.php` endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the vulnerable file upload feature, likely as a user or student of the system.

**SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability exists in the `lms\admin\edit_class.php` file due to insufficient input sanitization, which allows SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially access or modify the database through the injection point.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the vulnerable `id` parameter in `edit_class.php`.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the `edit_class.php` endpoint as an administrator.

The content provides a description of the vulnerabilities, the vulnerable file paths, and screenshots. It also indicates the use of SQLMap for exploitation in case of the SQL Injection vulnerability.
