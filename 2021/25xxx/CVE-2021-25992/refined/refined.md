Root cause of vulnerability:
The application does not properly invalidate user sessions upon logout.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613). The application fails to properly invalidate a user's session upon logout, allowing the session to be reused.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can reuse the admin cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the account even after the user has logged out. This could lead to a complete compromise of the account and application.

Attack vectors:
An attacker can gain access to the admin cookies through local or network access, or through other hypothetical attack methods.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to obtain the admin cookies. This could be achieved by gaining local access, monitoring network traffic, or via other means. The attacker does not need to be logged in and can reuse the session after the legitimate user has logged out.
