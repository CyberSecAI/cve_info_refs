{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not have proper authorization, CSRF protection, and sanitization/escaping when creating profiles.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user can create a profile containing malicious JavaScript code which is then executed in the browser of other users when they access the profile download functionality. This allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user creates a malicious profile with XSS payload by sending a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=kc_create_profile`. The XSS payload is triggered when another user visits  `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=kc_download_profile&name=y`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (at least subscriber role)."
