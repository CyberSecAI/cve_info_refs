- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate the submitted rating, allowing submission of long integers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service (DoS) on the post/page. Submitting a large integer as a rating can cause performance issues or crashes when the rating is processed or displayed.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to `wp-comments-post.php` with a large integer in the `rtng_rating[0]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to post comments. This can be achieved by unchecking "Comment must be manually approved" under Settings -> Discussion and setting "Enable Rating for" to "All" in the plugin settings.
