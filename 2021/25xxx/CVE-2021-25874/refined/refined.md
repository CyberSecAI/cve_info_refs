Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-25874:

**1. Verification:**

The content explicitly mentions "Assigned CVE-2021-25874 for SQL Injection", confirming its relevance to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input (`$_GET['catName']`) before using it in SQL queries. The application inadequately filters the input by only removing single quotes, but not other characters that enable SQL injection.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `$_GET['catName']` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without sufficient sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Extraction:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as password hashes.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By using SQL injection, it's possible for unauthenticated users to gain administrative privileges.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `catName` parameter in the HTTP GET request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details and Exploit:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `getVideo()` function of YouPHPTube and AVideo projects.
*   The application only removes simple quotes from user input, which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
*   An attacker can use encoded backslashes (`%5c`) to bypass the simple quote filtering, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
*   The report provides specific examples of how to exploit the vulnerability using `UNION SELECT` statements to extract password hashes.

**Versions Affected:**

*   AVideo, versions 10.0 and below
*   YouPHPTube, version 7.8 and below
