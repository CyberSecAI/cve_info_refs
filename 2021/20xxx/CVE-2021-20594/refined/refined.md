Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-20594:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to obtain legitimate usernames registered in the module via a brute-force attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can acquire legitimate usernames registered in the module.
*   While username acquisition is possible, an attacker would still need the correct password to log in to the system, preventing immediate access after successful username acquisition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote network attack

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected module.
*   The attacker needs to perform a brute-force attack on usernames.

**Additional Details from CISA Advisory:**
* CVSS v4 score is 8.2 (CVSS4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)
* The affected products are:
    *   MELSEC iQ-R series Safety CPUs (R08/16/32/120SFCPU) with firmware versions "26" and prior
    *   MELSEC iQ-R series SIL2 Process CPUs (R08/16/32/120PSFCPU) with firmware versions "11" and prior
*   The advisory also mentions the following vulnerabilities present in the same product range:
    * CVE-2021-20597: Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522). A remote attacker could obtain unprotected credentials by sniffing network traffic.
    * CVE-2021-20598: Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism (CWE-645). A remote attacker could lock out a legitimate user by continually attempting to login with a known username and incorrect passwords.

**Mitigations:**

*   Use a firewall or virtual private network (VPN) to prevent unauthorized access.
*   Use within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks.
*   Use the IP filter function to restrict the accessible IP addresses.
*   Fixed firmware versions are available: "27" or later for the R08/16/32/120SFCPU and "12" or later for the R08/16/32/120PSFCPU.
