- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Business form output plugin for EC-CUBE 3.0 series does not properly sanitize user-provided input, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can inject a specially crafted script into a specific input field of an EC-CUBE website, potentially leading to arbitrary script execution in the administrator's web browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the administrator, steal cookies, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a vulnerable input field on the EC-CUBE website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit input to the vulnerable website, which is publicly accessible or accessible to the administrator.
