Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-20096:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the OpenOversight application. This allows attackers to forge application requests through crafted links or forms, tricking authenticated users into performing actions they did not intend.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** Multiple actions within the application can be performed without a CSRF token.
    *   Normal users can be tricked into submitting bad data related to image classification.
    *   Admin users can be tricked into deleting, enabling, disabling, and approving user accounts, including their own, effectively locking them out of the platform.
    *   Admins and area coordinators can be tricked into deleting incidents, links, notes, and descriptions associated with police officers.
*   **Stored XSS:** An authenticated admin can inject malicious JavaScript code via officer ranks which can then be executed when other admins attempt to delete the rank, leading to potential information disclosure.
*   **Autocomplete enabled on login fields:** This can allow an attacker to use a malicious script to capture user credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate data within the application, such as image classification.
*   **Account Takeover/Denial of Service:** Attackers can disable, delete, or approve user accounts (including admin accounts), potentially locking admins out of the platform.
*   **Data Loss:** Attackers can delete incidents, links, notes, and descriptions associated with police officers.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The stored XSS vulnerability allows attackers to retrieve sensitive information, like admin email addresses and passwords.
*   **Credential Theft:** The autocomplete vulnerability can lead to the theft of user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** Attackers can use crafted links or forms to trick users into submitting requests they didn't intend.
*   **Stored XSS:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code through the officer rank functionality.
*   **Autocomplete:** Attackers use malicious scripts to retrieve credentials when autocomplete is enabled on login fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CSRF:** Attackers need to be able to craft malicious links or forms. They do not need to be authenticated but require a victim to have an active authenticated session.
*  **Stored XSS:** Attackers need administrator privileges in OpenOversight.
*  **Autocomplete:** Attackers need to be able to inject the malicious javascript.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation of both CSRF and Stored XSS vulnerabilities requires the victim to interact with the crafted links, forms, or malicious content.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) for deleting an incident using CSRF.
*   The vulnerability affects OpenOversight versions 0.6.4 and possibly earlier.
*   The recommended solution is to upgrade to OpenOversight version 0.6.5 or later.
