Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-20190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how `FasterXML jackson-databind` handles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing. Specifically, it mishandles polymorphic deserialization when default typing is enabled. This allows an attacker to inject malicious data, leading to various attack scenarios. The vulnerable classes are related to JDK Swing components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is that the library deserializes data without proper validation, leading to the instantiation of arbitrary classes and execution of malicious code.
*   **Polymorphic Typing:** The use of `enableDefaultTyping()` along with `@JsonTypeInfo` using `id.CLASS` or `id.MINIMAL_CLASS` makes the application vulnerable to providing a malicious class name for deserialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by crafting malicious payloads.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The ability to deserialize specific classes, like `javax.swing.JTextPane`, allows an attacker to perform SSRF attacks.
*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** The vulnerability poses a high threat to data confidentiality and integrity, as attackers can read, modify, or delete sensitive information.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to DoS by causing unexpected application behavior or resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network, allowing remote attackers to target vulnerable systems.
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The primary attack vector involves sending malicious JSON payloads to the server that are then deserialized by `jackson-databind`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Crafted JSON Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to send JSON data to the application.
*   **Vulnerable `jackson-databind` Library:** The target application must be using a vulnerable version of the `jackson-databind` library (versions 2.9.x prior to 2.9.10.7 and also prior to 2.6.7.5).
*   **`enableDefaultTyping()` Enabled:** The application must have enabled default typing using  `mapper.enableDefaultTyping()`.
*   **Presence of Vulnerable Class:** The vulnerable class, like `javax.swing.JEditorPane` or  `javax.swing.JTextPane`, must be on the application's classpath.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is related to a class of JDK Swing.
*   The fix is included in versions 2.9.10.7 and 2.6.7.5 of the `jackson-databind` library.
*   Versions of Jackson 2.10.0 and later, are not considered valid CVE for this issue because they have safe default typing as described in the content.
*   Several Red Hat products ship vulnerable versions but are not exploitable due to the default settings and are thus of a lower threat.
*   NetApp has acknowledged that multiple products are affected.
*   Oracle has listed this CVE as being patched in their July 2021 CPU.
*   RedHat has also released a fix for this issue in OpenShift Container Platform 4.6.

In summary, CVE-2021-20190 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in `jackson-databind` that can lead to remote code execution, SSRF, data compromise, and denial of service. Exploitation requires the presence of vulnerable classes, a vulnerable version of the library, and `enableDefaultTyping()` to be enabled, and the ability to send malicious JSON payloads to the application.
