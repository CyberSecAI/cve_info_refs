Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20177:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `bugzilla.redhat.com` and `bugzilla.kernel.org` clearly indicates that the vulnerability described is indeed CVE-2021-20177. The Red Hat bugzilla entry explicitly links to the CVE, and the kernel.org bugzilla entry describes the same issue.

**2. Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of string matching within a packet, specifically when used with `iptables`. The vulnerability occurs in the `skb_seq_read` function, which is used by the `bm_find` function which is a part of the `ts_bm` module for string matching in `iptables`.  This issue is triggered when using a specific string match rule with the "bm" (Boyer-Moore) algorithm and the "--icase" flag.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core weakness lies in how the kernel handles the sequence reading of packet data when performing a string match using the Boyer-Moore algorithm with case-insensitive matching. It appears a linked list traversal using the `skb->next` pointer was not properly handled, leading to a use-after-free when the skb was being processed in the netfilter hook.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Panic/Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a kernel panic, leading to a system crash and denial of service. This can be triggered locally by a user with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability, including those within a container with the same capability.
*  **Potential for Worse (Speculative):** The initial description mentions "possibly worse". This implies a possibility, though not confirmed by the provided content, that the vulnerability could be exploited for more severe impact than just DoS, like possibly gaining code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local, as the attacker needs to be able to insert iptables rules.
*   **`CAP_NET_ADMIN` Capability:** A user with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability can insert malicious iptables rules to trigger the vulnerability. This includes users within containers that have been granted this capability.
*   **`iptables` String Match Rule:** The specific rule needed to trigger the vulnerability is an `iptables` rule using the string match module (`-m string`) with the Boyer-Moore algorithm (`--algo bm`) and case-insensitive matching (`--icase`) and a specific string.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user with the ability to insert `iptables` rules. This could be a root user or a user with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system.

**Technical Details (from the provided data):**

*   **Vulnerable Function:** `skb_seq_read` in `net/core/skbuff.c`.
*   **Triggering Rule (Example):** `iptables -t raw -I PREROUTING -m string --icase --algo bm --string "ancd" -j DROP`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions prior to the fix. The fix was included in kernel 5.5 and backported to 5.4.
*   The bug was initially introduced by commit `d18d22ce8f62839365c984b1df474d3975ed4eb2` (according to `bugzilla.kernel.org`) which was about fixing packet reordering.
*   The fix was committed as `6ec51459df7117dbe9b1fef2174951f80877a850` in the 5.4 stable branch (according to `bugzilla.kernel.org`).

In summary, CVE-2021-20177 is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem that can be exploited by a local privileged user to cause a denial of service through a kernel panic by crafting a malicious iptables rule.
