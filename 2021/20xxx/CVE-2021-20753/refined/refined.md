  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement of the web page
  - Malicious actions performed under the user's context

- The malicious script is executed when a user accesses the scheduler data containing the injected script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to modify scheduler data.
- The user accessing the scheduler must also be logged in for the malicious script to execute in the browser.
