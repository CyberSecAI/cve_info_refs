Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an OS command injection flaw present in certain Elecom router models. Specifically, a lack of proper input sanitization or validation within the affected routers' firmware allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject OS commands, which arises from insufficient input validation.
- **Lack of Authentication:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker within the adjacent network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the affected router. This can lead to a range of malicious activities:
    - Full control over the device
    - Data exfiltration
    - Installation of malware
    - Denial of service
    - Network pivoting
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Adjacent Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable router to exploit this flaw.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Web Management Interface**: According to the Elecom advisory, the attack vector involves accessing the device web management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be located on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
- No prior authentication is needed, making the attack easily accessible.
- Technical proficiency to craft malicious OS commands for injection.

**Affected Products:**
The following Elecom router models are affected by the command injection vulnerability:
    - WRC-300FEBK
    - WRC-F300NF
    - WRC-733FEBK
    - WRH-300RD
    - WRH-300BK
    - WRH-300SV
    - WRH-300WH
    - WRH-H300WH
    - WRH-H300BK
    - WRH-300BK-S
    - WRH-300WH-S

**Mitigation:**
- The vendor recommends discontinuing the use of the affected models and replacing them with alternative products.
- There are no firmware updates available to patch this vulnerability for these devices.
