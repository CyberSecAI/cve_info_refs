| What's the problem (or question)? An issue was discovered in upx 3.96(**devel** branch), There is an illegal memory access in function canPack at p\_lx\_elf.cpp:2571. I also check the newest release version meet the same crash, lies at p\_lx\_elf.cpp:2490. What should have happened? no illegal memory access (crash) Do you have an idea for a solution? check the relocation\_offset and do not access the illegal memory How can we reproduce the issue?  1. Compile the devel branch with sanitize open    `export BUILD_TYPE_SANITIZE=1; make all` 2. Use `upx.out poc` and get crash    download the [poc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A-Xdx6QwEmtKij4IX3KbzNuNBnxbClYw/view?usp=sharing) here.  source ``` 2566                             unsigned rel_off = get_te64(&dynseg[-1+ z_rel].d_val); 2567                             Elf64_Rela *rp = (Elf64_Rela *)&file_image[rel_off]; 2568                             unsigned relsz   = get_te64(&dynseg[-1+ z_rsz].d_val); 2569                             Elf64_Rela *last = (Elf64_Rela *)(relsz + (char *)rp); 2570                             for (; rp < last; ++rp) { 2571                                 unsigned r_va = get_te64(&rp->r_offset); 2572                                 if (r_va == user_init_ava) { // found the Elf64_Rela 2573                                     unsigned r_info = get_te64(&rp->r_info); 2574                                     unsigned r_type = ELF64_R_TYPE(r_info); 2575                                     if (Elf64_Ehdr::EM_AARCH64 == e_machine 2576                                     &&  R_AARCH64_RELATIVE == r_type) { 2577                                         user_init_va = get_te64(&rp->r_addend); 2578                                     } ```  the source code didn't check the **rel\_off** so get an illegal rp debug [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23634386/98940951-cb04b380-2526-11eb-9dd5-6734b7298007.png) bug report ``` ASAN:SIGSEGV ================================================================= ==65507==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x6300004013e8 (pc 0x00000055aff0 bp 0x0c3600003e31 sp 0x7ffc8f9b7378 T0)     #0 0x55afef in get_le64(void const*) /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/bele_policy.h:193     #1 0x55afef in N_BELE_RTP::LEPolicy::get64(void const*) const /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/bele_policy.h:194     #2 0x49dfe2 in Packer::get_te64(void const*) const /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/packer.h:297     #3 0x49dfe2 in PackLinuxElf64::canPack() /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/p_lx_elf.cpp:2571     #4 0x5240a6 in try_pack /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/packmast.cpp:91     #5 0x52518f in PackMaster::visitAllPackers(Packer* (*)(Packer*, void*), InputFile*, options_t const*, void*) /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/packmast.cpp:194     #6 0x526d19 in PackMaster::getPacker(InputFile*) /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/packmast.cpp:240     #7 0x526e3c in PackMaster::pack(OutputFile*) /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/packmast.cpp:260     #8 0x55bede in do_one_file(char const*, char*) /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/work.cpp:158     #9 0x55c3ae in do_files(int, int, char**) /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/work.cpp:271     #10 0x403dbe in main /home/wanghao/upx_dev/src/main.cpp:1538     #11 0x7f702527783f in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x2083f) ``` Please tell us details about your environment.  * UPX version used (both `upx 3.96(devel)` and `upx 3.96 release`): * Host Operating System and version: ubuntu 16.04 * Host CPU architecture: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz * Target Operating System and version: ubuntu 16.04 * Target CPU architecture: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz |
