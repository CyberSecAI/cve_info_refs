- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The A-Stage SCT-40CM01SR and AT-40CM01SR liquid crystal televisions have an authentication bypass vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass (CWE-287).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with adjacent network access can log in via telnet without authentication and execute arbitrary commands. The vendor states that although arbitrary commands can be executed, core product functionalities cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Attack vectors:** Adjacent network access is required. Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited over telnet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
