Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a potential cipher leak within the `TransformSignature` function located in `MagickCore/signature.c`. Specifically, the issue occurs during the calculation of signatures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cipher Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a potential leak of sensitive cipher data. This suggests that during the signature calculation process, some of the cipher's internal state or intermediate values might be exposed.
*   The code uses `memset` to clear the `W` array but this can be optimized away by the compiler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality:** The most significant impact of this vulnerability is a breach of data confidentiality. If an attacker can successfully exploit the cipher leak, they might gain access to sensitive information that is supposed to be protected by the cipher.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Image Files:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted image file to an application using ImageMagick, triggering the vulnerable signature calculation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Submit Crafted Files:** An attacker needs to be able to submit a specially crafted image file to a system that uses a vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This means the attacker needs to be able to interact with software or systems that use ImageMagick to process images.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit log shows changes in `MagickCore/signature.c` where `memset` is replaced with `ResetMagickMemory`.  Additionally, `MagickCore/memory.c` was changed to define `ResetMagickMemory` using a volatile pointer to prevent compiler optimizations.
*   The issue was fixed in ImageMagick version 7.0.11.
*   The Debian LTS advisory confirms that this CVE is related to a potential cipher leak in the `TransformSignature` function.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the cipher leak in `MagickCore/signature.c`.
*  The fix prevents compiler optimizations from removing the buffer clearing
