Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The WordPress plugin "Browser and Operating System Finder" lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially induce unintended operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
If a logged-in administrator views a malicious web page, an attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions. This can potentially lead to changes in the plugin settings or other modifications within the wordpress site. The integrity of the system is at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker would need to craft a malicious web page that, when viewed by a logged-in administrator, would trigger the unintended actions. The user must interact with a malicious page (UI:R) for this to work.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker doesn't require any special privileges (PR:N) on the target system. They need to be able to entice a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious webpage. They do not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability and are able to attack over the network.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin is closed due to the security issue and is not available for download.
- The CVSS v3 score is 4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)
- The CVSS v2 score is 2.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
- The vulnerability was reported by imai shinpei of Cryptography Laboratory, Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Tokyo Denki University.
