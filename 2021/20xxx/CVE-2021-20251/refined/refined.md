  "CVE-2021-20251": {
    "description": "The Samba-Bugzilla entry and associated discussion reveal a race condition vulnerability related to the bad password count not being incremented atomically. This allows multiple simultaneous login attempts, with incorrect passwords, to bypass the lockout mechanism, as each process increments the count independently without synchronization. This affects Samba versions 4.1 and newer, particularly when using the prefork process model.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of atomic increment operation on the bad password count. Each connection to the samba server is handled by a separate process which increments the bad password count independently, resulting in a race condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Non-atomic operations",
	    "Insufficient interprocess synchronization"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of the vulnerability is that an attacker can bypass the bad password lockout mechanism and perform more login attempts than configured, enabling brute force attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network based attacks",
	    "Multiple simultaneous login attempts"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to make network connections to the SMB service",
	    "Ability to initiate multiple concurrent login attempts"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The bugzilla entry provides extensive details including the initial report, test scripts, patch attempts and discussions, which led to the eventual fix. The vulnerability exists in both the SAMR server and AD DC code paths. The Samba team initially addressed the issue by serializing the entire authentication path using a lock file, before moving to a more granular solution using mutexes specific to each user. The bug report also details the fixes made to the AD DC code, and that the KDC is also potentially vulnerable, although it was decided to not address that in the initial fix as it is less likely to be attacked in parallel. It also discusses the difficulties in writing a reliable test for a race condition and notes that the standard mitigation is 'choose good passwords', highlighting the complexity of the issue. The fix involves using transactions and runtime tdb to ensure atomic bad password counts. The NetApp advisory indicates that their products are not affected."
