Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20306:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the BPMN editor in Business Central incorrectly displaying Ruleflow Groups from other projects, even when a user lacks access to those projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information. Specifically, the names of Ruleflow Groups are revealed to unauthorized users.
*   **Authorization Bypass**: The system fails to properly restrict access to Ruleflow Group data based on project membership.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The most significant impact is the potential compromise of confidentiality. Attackers can learn about the existence and names of Ruleflow Groups in projects they are not authorized to access.
*   **Limited Severity:** The vulnerability is classified as having low severity, suggesting that the impact is primarily limited to information disclosure rather than enabling direct manipulation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user on the network or the internet, who has access to the Business Central BPMN editor.
*   **Authentication Required:** An attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the Business Central application in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker must be a valid and authenticated user of the Business Central application.
*   **Access to BPMN Editor:** The attacker needs to have the ability to use the BPMN editor functionality within the Business Central environment.
*   **No Project Access Required:** The attacker does not need to have access to the projects from which the ruleflow groups are being leaked. They can be part of a completely different project and still see the names of the ruleflow groups.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is tracked under the Red Hat Bugzilla ID 1946213.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Paramvir jindal.
*   The vulnerability is also associated with the JIRA ticket JBPM-9662.
