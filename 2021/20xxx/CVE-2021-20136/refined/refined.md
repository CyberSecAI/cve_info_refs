Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper access control in ManageEngine Log360. Specifically, it allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to overwrite the database configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The application fails to properly restrict access to the database configuration settings, allowing modification without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Configuration Overwrite:** Attackers can change the Log360's backend database to one they control.
*   **Forced Restart:**  The attacker can force the Log360 server to restart, causing disruption.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By altering the database and restarting the service, attackers can replace files executed during startup, achieving remote code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:** Legitimate users may be unable to log into Log360.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Login credentials for Log360 are stored in the database, allowing an attacker to gain access with the stolen/modified credentials.
*   **REST API Restriction Bypass:** The attacker can add more REST APIs to the authorized list in the database, potentially opening up new attack vectors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring prior authentication.
*   **Specially Crafted Messages:**  Attackers send a specific message to the Log360 server to change the database configuration and force a restart.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to have network access to the Log360 server (port 8095 in the example).
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to have any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept `curl` command demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability, by changing the database configurations in `<LOG360_DIR>\conf\database_params.conf` and forcing a restart.
*   The vulnerability affects ManageEngine Log360 builds prior to version 5235.
*   The vendor, ManageEngine, released a fix in Log360 version 5235.
