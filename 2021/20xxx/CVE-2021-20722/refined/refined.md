Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The installers for ScanSnap Manager and Software Download Installer have a vulnerability related to the DLL search path. This allows for insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The installers do not properly validate the location of DLLs before loading them, allowing for the loading of malicious DLLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer by placing a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will load it.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a specific folder where the installer will search for it.
- The user needs to execute the vulnerable installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have the ability to write files to a location where the installer looks for DLLs.
- The attacker must be able to trick a user into running the vulnerable installer.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the way the installers load DLLs, making them susceptible to DLL hijacking. An attacker can exploit this by placing a malicious DLL in a specific directory, which the installer will load and execute with the user's privileges, allowing arbitrary code execution.
