- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of Intent. Specifically, the application does not properly validate the source or content of Intents, allowing an attacker to launch arbitrary activities within the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of Intents (CWE-939), which allows an attacker to launch arbitrary activities within the Mercari application through a crafted Intent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By exploiting this vulnerability, a malicious page can launch an arbitrary Activity of the Mercari application. This can potentially lead to the unauthorized acquisition of the Mercari account's access token, which could then be used to further compromise the user's account.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. The attacker must entice the victim to visit a malicious page that will then send a crafted Intent to the vulnerable Mercari application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage that the user visits with the vulnerable application installed and the user must be interacting with the malicious webpage for the attack to succeed.
