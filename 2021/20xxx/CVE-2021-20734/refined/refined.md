Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-20734

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the Welcart e-Commerce WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows malicious JavaScript code to be stored within the application's database/persistent storage. This stored script is then executed when a user views the affected page in the backend admin panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser who is logged into the affected system.
*   If the logged-in user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control over the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a malicious page within the WordPress admin panel that is vulnerable to XSS. The attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code which is stored by the plugin.
*   The injected script will be executed when an admin user with sufficient privilege views the vulnerable page in the backend admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into a field of the Welcart e-Commerce plugin that is not properly sanitized. This likely means the attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input data of the vulnerable component.
* The attacker needs a user with administrative privileges to view the malicious page in order to trigger the vulnerability.
* No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability other than loading the malicious page.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Welcart e-Commerce plugin prior to 2.2.4.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Yu Iwama of Secure Sky Technology Inc. to IPA and coordinated with the vendor by JPCERT/CC.
*   The vendor has released version 2.2.4 which addresses the XSS vulnerability.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 6.1 (Medium) and CVSS v2 is 4.3 (Medium).
