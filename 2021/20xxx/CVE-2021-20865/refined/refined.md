Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-20865:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a missing authorization check within the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The plugin fails to properly verify if a user has the necessary permissions before allowing them to perform certain actions, specifically related to database browsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A lower-privileged user (e.g., Subscriber, Contributor, Author) can potentially bypass access controls and view sensitive database information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible remotely (AV:N) and does not require a complex attack (AC:L).
- An attacker would need to have a low-level account (PR:L) on the affected WordPress site.
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs a user account on the WordPress site, even with low privileges (e.g., Subscriber).
- The attacker can then exploit the missing authorization to view the database information.
