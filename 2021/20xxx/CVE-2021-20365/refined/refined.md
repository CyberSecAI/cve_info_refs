- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the use of `target blank` in HTML anchor tags, which can be exploited to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of user-controlled input in HTML anchor tags. Specifically the use of `target blank` in combination with user provided content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the user's session, potentially allowing for credentials disclosure, or other malicious actions within the trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code through HTML anchor tags.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to insert malicious JavaScript code through the web UI and then trick a user into clicking the crafted links.
