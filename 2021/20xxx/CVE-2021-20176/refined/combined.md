| When `attenuate` was set to zero, `SigmaPoisson` would be zero too. So a crafted file may trigger undefined behavior in the form of division by zero.

| Thanks for the problem report. We can reproduce it and will have a patch to fix it in the GIT master branch @ <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick> later today. The patch will be available in the beta releases of ImageMagick @ <https://www.imagemagick.org/download/beta/> by sometime tomorrow. |

Fixes the following security issue:

CVE-2021-20176: A divide-by-zero flaw was found in ImageMagick 6.9.11-57 and
7.0.10-57 in gem.c.  This flaw allows an attacker who submits a crafted file
that is processed by ImageMagick to trigger undefined behavior through a
division by zero.  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system
availability.

For more details, see the bugtracker:
https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/3077

- bump version to 7.0.10-62
- update license file hash (copyright year update)

Fixes the following security issue:

[CVE-2021-20176](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rjh9-hq94-crmg "CVE-2021-20176"): A divide-by-zero flaw was found in ImageMagick 6.9.11-57 and
7.0.10-57 in gem.c.  This flaw allows an attacker who submits a crafted file
that is processed by ImageMagick to trigger undefined behavior through a
division by zero.  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system
availability.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1916610#c0)  msiddiqu    2021-01-15 09:19:46 UTC  ```  A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/gem.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.10-56.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Description

A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/gem.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.10-56.
