Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error in the `GenerateDifferentialNoise()` function within the `gem.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, when the `SigmaPoisson` variable is zero, a division by `SigmaPoisson` occurs, leading to a crash. This can occur if the `attenuate` parameter is set to zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A divide-by-zero error exists in the `noise=(double) (QuantumRange*i/SigmaPoisson);` line in `MagickCore/gem.c`.
- The code lacks proper input validation or sanitization to prevent `SigmaPoisson` from being zero before performing the division.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most likely impact is a crash of the application due to the division-by-zero error, making the system unavailable.
- **Undefined Behavior:** The division-by-zero results in undefined behavior which may potentially lead to other issues, although this is not specified.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted File:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image file to ImageMagick that causes the `SigmaPoisson` to become zero. The crafted file would need to cause the `attenuate` parameter to be set to zero.
- **Image Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick processes the crafted file by calling the vulnerable `GenerateDifferentialNoise()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Submit a File:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a specially crafted image file to ImageMagick for processing.
- **No Special Privileges:** No specific privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability, as it occurs during normal image processing.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both ImageMagick versions 6 and 7.
- The fix involves using the `PerceptibleReciprocal()` function, which will return a reciprocal of the input while handling the case when the input is zero.
- Two different commits address the issue in version 7 ([fbd9a96](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/fbd9a963db1ae5551c45dc8af57db0abd7695774) and [9c06496](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/9c06496defe3e28e90da780f09baeb40f7d496ae)) and one for version 6 ([90255f0](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick6/commit/90255f0834eead08d59f46b0bda7b1580451cc0f) and [d348259](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick6/commit/d348259b3bffa12d6aeb308fffd6e572c4d62786)).
- The vulnerability is also present in `accelerate-kernels-private.h`, which was addressed in commit [9c06496](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/9c06496defe3e28e90da780f09baeb40f7d496ae) and [d348259](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick6/commit/d348259b3bffa12d6aeb308fffd6e572c4d62786).
- The vulnerability is fixed by using the `PerceptibleReciprocal` function, which returns a reciprocal, but handles the case when input is zero by returning 0.
- A pull request ([#3192](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/pull/3192)) was created to fix the divide-by-zero using `PerceptibleReciprocal()`.
- Red Hat bug report [1916610](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1916610) indicates that the fix was in ImageMagick 6.9.11-57 and 7.0.10-57.
