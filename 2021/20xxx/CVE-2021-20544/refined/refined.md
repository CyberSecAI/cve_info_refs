Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20544:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the ability to induce the IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management application (specifically Jazz Team Server) to perform server-side HTTP and HTTPS requests to arbitrary domains. This is due to the application's capability to interact with external services which, while sometimes intended, can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- External Service Interaction: The core weakness is the application's capability to be manipulated into interacting with arbitrary external services via HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) potential: Although not explicitly stated as SSRF, the description highly suggests the presence of this vulnerability due to the ability to induce arbitrary requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The ability to trigger arbitrary external service interactions can indicate a vulnerability.
- It can potentially lead to unauthorized access to internal resources if the application is used to make requests to internal infrastructure.
- Could be used for information gathering or other malicious activities by redirecting requests to attacker-controlled servers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the application in a way that causes it to make requests to external, attacker-controlled services.
- This could involve providing crafted input that the application interprets as a request to a URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable application in a way that allows them to control the target of outbound HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- The attacker would need knowledge of how to trigger these requests, likely through a vulnerable parameter or configuration.
- They do not need to be on the same network as the server in order to exploit the vulnerability, only need to send crafted requests.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Jazz Team Server versions: 6.0.6, 6.0.6.1, 7.0, 7.0.1, 7.0.2

**Remediation:**
The vulnerability is addressed through specific iFix patches for each affected version of Jazz Team Server, which are referenced in the document.
