Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-20799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the management screen of Cybozu Remote Service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):**  The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input when rendering web pages in the management interface. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within a logged-in user's web browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities:
    - Session hijacking (stealing session cookies)
    - Defacement of the application interface
    - Phishing attacks (redirecting to malicious websites)
    - Data theft or modification
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (AV:N):** The attack is performed over a network connection.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is relatively easy to execute.
- **User Interaction Required (UI:R):**  The attacker needs a logged-in user to interact with the malicious content in their browser (e.g., by visiting a crafted URL, or by triggering the vulnerability within the management screen).
- **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):**  The attacker needs to have at least basic user privileges (i.e. be a logged in user) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to inject malicious script into the management interface. This could be through:
    - Stored XSS (the script is stored in the application database)
    - Reflected XSS (the script is part of the URL/request)
- The attacker does not need any special permissions besides being a user with a valid login.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects versions 3.1.8 and 3.1.9 of Cybozu Remote Service.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.0.0.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as medium (CVSS v3 base score of 5.4).
