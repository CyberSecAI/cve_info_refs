Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-20597:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficiently protected credentials during the process of registering user information or changing passwords in the MELSEC iQ-R series CPU modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** Credentials transmitted over the network are not adequately protected, allowing them to be intercepted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can sniff network traffic to obtain user credentials (usernames and passwords).
- This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the CPU module.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Sniffing:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sniffing network traffic when user information is registered or passwords are changed on the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the user's machine and the MELSEC iQ-R series CPU module.
- The attacker does not need prior access or credentials to begin this attack.
