Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-20093:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a buffer over-read in the CodeMeter CmLAN server when handling unencrypted messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unencrypted Messages:** The CmLAN server processes unencrypted messages from remote clients if the message body starts with `\xA2\x05`.
*  **Heap Buffer Over-read:** When generating a response to a crafted message, the server copies data from a fixed-size (0x100 bytes) heap-based buffer to an output buffer. The amount of data to copy is controlled by the attacker through the crafted message.
*  **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The server fails to validate if the requested copy size exceeds the boundaries of the source heap-based buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can read arbitrary heap memory contents by specifying a copy size larger than the buffer. This could expose sensitive data.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a crash of the CodeMeter Runtime Server (CodeMeter.exe) by triggering a buffer over-read, leading to an access violation due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by sending a specially crafted TCP/IP packet to the CmLAN server (default port 22350).
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have network access to the CodeMeter CmLAN server.
*   The attacker needs to send a crafted message to trigger the vulnerability.
*  No authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `memmove` function call where the copy size parameter is attacker controlled causing an out-of-bounds read from a heap buffer.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided proof of concepts demonstrate how to trigger the heap memory disclosure and denial of service conditions.
*  The vulnerability is present in all versions of CodeMeter Runtime prior to v7.21a.
*   Wibu-Systems recommends updating to CodeMeter 7.21a or later to fix this vulnerability.
*   Mitigation measures include:
    *   Running CodeMeter in client-only mode and using localhost for communication.
    *   Using a host-based firewall to restrict access to the CmLAN port.
