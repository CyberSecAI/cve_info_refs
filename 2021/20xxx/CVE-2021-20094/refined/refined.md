Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the CodeMeter CmWAN server, specifically in how it handles unencrypted messages. The server allows these messages if the message body starts with `\xA2\x05`. When processing such messages, it attempts to call a C++ virtual function via a pointer located at offset 0x28 of the vftable. However, this pointer doesn't point to a valid function, but rather to a read-only data section, which leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The server accepts unencrypted messages based on a specific prefix without proper validation.
*   **Invalid Virtual Function Call:**  The code attempts to call a function at an address that is not a valid code address, leading to an access violation.
*   **Missing Input Validation:** The code does not check if the vtable entry contains a valid pointer to code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the termination of the CodeMeter Runtime Server (CodeMeter.exe). The process crashes due to an access violation exception when attempting to execute invalid memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via network access to the CmWAN port.
*   **Unauthenticated:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability if they can access the CmWAN port directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target's CmWAN server port (default port 22351).
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not require any authentication to trigger the vulnerability if they have direct network access to the CmWAN port.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content gives a detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability including the vulnerable code snippet, the invalid memory address being called, and the resulting access violation.
*   The advisory states that the CmWAN server is disabled by default, reducing the attack surface.
*   It also recommends running the CmWAN server behind a reverse proxy with TLS and user authentication to further mitigate the risk and to use host-based firewalls to restrict access to the CmWAN port.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in CodeMeter version 7.21a.
*   The vulnerability is also referred to as a buffer over-read in some contexts although the root cause is a call to an invalid address in memory.
