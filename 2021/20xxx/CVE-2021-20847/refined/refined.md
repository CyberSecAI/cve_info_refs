Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-20847

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the WebUI of the Wi-Fi STATION SH-52A device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The device's WebUI is susceptible to XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the web browser of a user who is accessing the device's WebUI. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Stealing user session cookies or other sensitive information.
  - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the WebUI.
  - Potentially gaining further access to the user's device or network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **WebUI:** The primary attack vector is through the WebUI of the Wi-Fi STATION SH-52A. An attacker would need to inject malicious code into a field or parameter that is not properly sanitized before being displayed to the user.
- **Adjacent Network:** The CVSS v3 vector suggests the attack can originate from an adjacent network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device, according to CVSS v3.
- **High Privileges (CVSS v3):** The CVSS v3 score indicates "High" privileges are required. This might refer to an administrative user or an authenticated user with high-level access to the WebUI.
- **User Interaction (CVSS v3):** The CVSS v3 score also specifies "User Interaction" is Required. This indicates a user of the WebUI must perform some action (such as clicking a link, viewing a page) to trigger the XSS payload.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects multiple firmware versions of the Wi-Fi STATION SH-52A.
- The vulnerability was reported by Takayuki Sasaki of Yokohama National University.
- The vendor, NTT DOCOMO, INC., has released a fix via a software update.
- Both CVSS v2 and CVSS v3 metrics are provided.
