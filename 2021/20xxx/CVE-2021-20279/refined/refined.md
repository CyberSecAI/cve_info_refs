Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-20279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insufficient sanitization of the "ID number" user profile field in Moodle. This allows users to inject malicious code into this field, which is then stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that the injected malicious script is permanently stored within the application (in this case, Moodle's database) and executed when other users view the affected profile.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of other users who view the profile containing the malicious payload.
*   **Account Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking of other users.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Defacement:**  An attacker could alter the appearance of the page viewed by other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Profile Field:** The attack vector is through the "ID number" user profile field.
*   **User Input:** An attacker injects malicious code as input into this field.
*   **Stored Payload:** The injected code is stored in the Moodle database.
*   **User Browsing:** The malicious script is then executed when a user views the infected user profile.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Moodle Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid Moodle account.
*   **Profile Editing:** The attacker needs the ability to edit their own user profile.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any special administrative privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Moodle versions 3.10 to 3.10.1, 3.9 to 3.9.4, 3.8 to 3.8.7, 3.5 to 3.5.16 and earlier unsupported versions.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Moodle versions 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8 and 3.5.17
*   A workaround is to disable the "ID number" field in "Site admin > Users > User policies > Show user identity" until the patch is applied.
