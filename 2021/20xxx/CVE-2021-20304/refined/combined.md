### @peterhillman **[peterhillman](/peterhillman)** commented [Oct 10, 2020](#issue-718521546)

Address negative shift reported by <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=26229>.

As I understand it, a corrupt EXR file has a declared length of a short Huffman code (`pl.len`) that exceeds the number of bits remaining to represent it (`lc`). This causes the `lc` to go negative, causing a negative left shift, which has undefined behavior.

This is the 'non-fast' path taken when there are less than 128 bits of data. testHuf has been updated to test with small as well as large data sizes to ensure both decoders are covered.

This could potentially lead to an impact on application availability when OpenEXR processes a crafted input file.   ``` |  |
