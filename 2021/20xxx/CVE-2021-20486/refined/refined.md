- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Data assets in a catalog, when not modified within a 7-day period, expire from the policy service cache.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Data protection rules and policies defined in Watson Knowledge Catalog (WKC) are not enforced in Data Virtualization (DV) due to the expiration of cached data assets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Data protection rules defined in WKC may not be enforced on data assets accessed through DV, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is not directly exploitable. It manifests when the system is left running without modifications to data assets over a 7-day period.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need specific capabilities. The vulnerability is a design issue that allows the lack of data modifications within a given period to cause the system to not enforce protection rules.
