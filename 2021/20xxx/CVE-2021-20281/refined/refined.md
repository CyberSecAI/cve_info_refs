Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the way the "online users block" in Moodle handles user information. Specifically, it fails to properly check user permissions before displaying full names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is a lack of proper access control checks. Some users who should not have permission to view other users' full names could access this information through the online users block.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The weakness leads to the disclosure of users' full names to unauthorized individuals.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to privacy violations, as full names are exposed to unauthorized users.
*   **Potential for Social Engineering:** Full names might be leveraged in social engineering or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Online Users Block:** The vulnerability is triggered by interacting with the "online users block" within Moodle. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by simply being a user within the Moodle instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Moodle User Account:** The attacker needs to have an account within the affected Moodle instance to be able to access the "online users block." No special privileges are necessary.
*   **No Special Skills:** The vulnerability is exploited passively by accessing the block and thus does not require special skills on the part of the attacker.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Moodle versions 3.10 to 3.10.1, 3.9 to 3.9.4, 3.8 to 3.8.7, and 3.5 to 3.5.16, as well as earlier unsupported versions.
*  **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Moodle versions 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, and 3.5.17.
*   **Workaround:** A temporary workaround is to hide the "online users block" until a patch is applied.
*   **Severity:** The severity of this vulnerability is considered low.
