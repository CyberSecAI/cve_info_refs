  - Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack is triggered by a user interaction (UI:R), meaning the victim needs to take some action (e.g., clicking on a crafted link).
- The attacker injects malicious code through the role authority setting screen which gets executed in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
