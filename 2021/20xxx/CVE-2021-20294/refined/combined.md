I downloaded source code from ftp server, and I built it with Ubuntu 18.04 with gcc 7.5.0 with ASAN, and the following command to build readelf from the source: CFLAGS="-O1 -fsanitize=address -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE" ./configure; make clean all;  You can reproduce the crash with the following command: ./readelf --dyn-syms <attached file>  The AddressSanitizer message of the crash is: ==90332==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow on address 0x7ffd502affe0 at pc 0x7f8ed10b98f9 bp 0x7ffd502afd00 sp 0x7ffd502af490 WRITE of size 364 at 0x7ffd502affe0 thread T0     #0 0x7f8ed10b98f8 in __interceptor_vsprintf (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.4+0x9e8f8)     #1 0x7f8ed10b9c86 in __interceptor_sprintf (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.4+0x9ec86)     #2 0x55d1d3eaeb01 in print_dynamic_symbol (/home/vul337/rfuzz/psrc/binutils-2.35.1/binutils/readelf+0xd3b01)     #3 0x55d1d3eaf9c9 in process_symbol_table (/home/vul337/rfuzz/psrc/binutils-2.35.1/binutils/readelf+0xd49c9)     #4 0x55d1d3ed59b3 in process_object (/home/vul337/rfuzz/psrc/binutils-2.35.1/binutils/readelf+0xfa9b3)     #5 0x55d1d3ede499 in main (/home/vul337/rfuzz/psrc/binutils-2.35.1/binutils/readelf+0x103499)     #6 0x7f8ed0c4bbf6 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21bf6)     #7 0x55d1d3e83a59 in _start (/home/vul337/rfuzz/psrc/binutils-2.35.1/binutils/readelf+0xa8a59)  Address 0x7ffd502affe0 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 416 in frame     #0 0x55d1d3eadd8d in print_dynamic_symbol (/home/vul337/rfuzz/psrc/binutils-2.35.1/binutils/readelf+0xd2d8d)    This frame has 3 object(s):     [32, 34) 'vna_other'     [96, 100) 'sym_info'     [160, 416) 'buffer' <== Memory access at offset 416 overflows this variable ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=26929#c1)  Sourceware Commits    2020-11-22 05:42:22 UTC  ``` The binutils-2_35-branch branch has been updated by Alan Modra <amodra@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=372dd157272e0674d13372655cc60eaca9c06926>  commit 372dd157272e0674d13372655cc60eaca9c06926 Author: Alan Modra <amodra@gmail.com> Date:   Mon Jul 6 09:00:29 2020 +0930      asan: readelf: stack buffer overflow                  [PR 26929](show_bug.cgi?id=26929 "RESOLVED FIXED - [readelf] crash with ASAN in print_dynamic_symbol")             * readelf.c (print_dynamic_symbol): Don't sprintf to buffer to             find string length.

This should not be considered a security bug.  It's not a DoS for the reason you mentioned and it requires a potential victim to run readelf on an untrusted file (thus not "remote"), but it does have a stack buffer overflow out-of-bounds write of attacker-supplied data. Therefore, Red Hat Product Security has kept it as a security vulnerability and assigned a CVE.   ``` |  |
