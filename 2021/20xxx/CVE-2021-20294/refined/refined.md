Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-20294:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `print_dynamic_symbol` function within the `readelf` utility of the GNU Binutils package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `print_dynamic_symbol` function uses `sprintf` to write data into a stack-allocated buffer. The size of the written data is not properly checked against the buffer's capacity, allowing a crafted ELF file to cause a buffer overflow.
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** This overflow leads to an out-of-bounds write operation on the stack, overwriting adjacent stack memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow causes a crash of the `readelf` utility.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution (Limited):** While not explicitly mentioned, out-of-bounds writes on the stack can potentially be leveraged for more serious impact like arbitrary code execution, but this is mitigated by modern OS protections. Red Hat states "The highest impact of this flaw is to confidentiality, integrity, and availability".

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted ELF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a maliciously crafted ELF file as input to the `readelf` utility.
- **Local User:** An attacker needs a way to make the victim use `readelf` on the malicious file, therefore, the attacker is not remote.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted ELF file.
- The attacker must convince a user to execute `readelf` on the crafted file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during fuzzing experiments.
- The fix involved avoiding `sprintf` to determine string length and was implemented in commit `ddb43bab174`
- Modern OS protections like stack canaries, non-executable stack (NX), and address space layout randomization (ASLR) mitigate the severity of the vulnerability, but do not completely eliminate it.

In summary, CVE-2021-20294 is a stack buffer overflow in the `readelf` tool that can be triggered by a crafted ELF file, potentially leading to a denial of service and, in theory, other exploits, but mitigated by modern OS protections.
