Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-20246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a division-by-zero error in the `ScaleResampleFilter()` function within the `MagickCore/resample.c` file of ImageMagick. This occurs when the `resample_filter->support` variable is set to zero, leading to a zero value for `F`. Subsequently, the code attempts to divide by this zero value, causing the error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation or error handling before performing division operations, specifically the division by the variable 'F', which can become zero.
- **Uncontrolled Input:** The value of `resample_filter->support` which leads to zero for 'F' is derived from the image being processed, meaning a crafted input can control and exploit this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash of the application due to the division-by-zero error. This results in a denial-of-service, making the system unavailable.
- **Potential Undefined Behavior:** The CVE description notes that, while DoS is the primary threat, there might also be other undefined behaviors as a result of the math error, which could lead to unspecified impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Image File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image file to ImageMagick. When ImageMagick processes this malicious image, it triggers the division-by-zero error in the `ScaleResampleFilter()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Input:** The attacker needs the ability to submit image files to a system that uses the vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This could be through a web application, image processing service, or any other system that uses ImageMagick to handle images.
