Following the clamping, \* the square of this distance is \* \* ( ( s \* major\_unit\_x + t \* major\_unit\_y ) / major\_mag )^2 \* + \* ( ( s \* minor\_unit\_x + t \* minor\_unit\_y ) / minor\_mag )^2 \* \* If such distances will be computed for many [s,t]'s, it makes \* sense to actually compute the reciprocal of major\_mag and \* minor\_mag and multiply them by the above unit lengths. \* \* Now, if you want to modify the input pair of tangent vectors so \* that it defines the modified ellipse, all you have to do is set \* \* newdux = major\_mag \* major\_unit\_x \* newdvx = major\_mag \* major\_unit\_y \* newduy = minor\_mag \* minor\_unit\_x = minor\_mag \* -major\_unit\_y \* newdvy = minor\_mag \* minor\_unit\_y = minor\_mag \* major\_unit\_x \* \* and use these tangent vectors as if they were the original ones. \* Usually, this is a drastic change in the tangent vectors even if \* the singular values are not clamped; for example, the minor axis \* vector always points in a direction which is 90 degrees \* counterclockwise from the direction of the major axis vector. \*/ /\* \* Discussion: \* \* GOAL: Fix things so that the pullback, in input space, of a disk \* of radius r in output space is an ellipse which contains, at \* least, a disc of radius r. (Make this hold for any r>0.) \* \* ESSENCE OF THE METHOD: Compute the product of the first two \* factors of an SVD of the linear transformation defining the \* ellipse and make sure that both its columns have norm at least 1. \* Because rotations and reflexions map disks to themselves, it is \* not necessary to compute the third (rightmost) factor of the SVD. \* \* DETAILS: Find the singular values and (unit) left singular \* vectors of Jinv, clampling up the singular values to 1, and \* multiply the unit left singular vectors by the new singular \* values in order to get the minor and major ellipse axis vectors. \* \* Image resampling context: \* \* The Jacobian matrix of the transformation at the output point \* under consideration is defined as follows: \* \* Consider the transformation (x,y) -> (X,Y) from input locations \* to output locations. (Anthony Thyssen, elsewhere in resample.c, \* uses the notation (u,v) -> (x,y).) \* \* The Jacobian matrix of the transformation at (x,y) is equal to \* \* J = [ A, B ] = [ dX/dx, dX/dy ] \* [ C, D ] [ dY/dx, dY/dy ] \* \* that is, the vector [A,C] is the tangent vector corresponding to \* input changes in the horizontal direction, and the vector [B,D] \* is the tangent vector corresponding to input changes in the \* vertical direction. \* \* In the context of resampling, it is natural to use the inverse \* Jacobian matrix Jinv because resampling is generally performed by \* pulling pixel locations in the output image back to locations in \* the input image. Jinv is \* \* Jinv = [ a, b ] = [ dx/dX, dx/dY ] \* [ c, d ] [ dy/dX, dy/dY ] \* \* Note: Jinv can be computed from J with the following matrix \* formula: \* \* Jinv = 1/(A\*D-B\*C) [ D, -B ] \* [ -C, A ] \* \* What we do is modify Jinv so that it generates an ellipse which \* is as close as possible to the original but which contains the \* unit disk. This can be accomplished as follows: \* \* Let \* \* Jinv = U Sigma V^T \* \* be an SVD decomposition of Jinv. (The SVD is not unique, but the \* final ellipse does not depend on the particular SVD.) \* \* We could clamp up the entries of the diagonal matrix Sigma so \* that they are at least 1, and then set \* \* Jinv = U newSigma V^T. \* \* However, we do not need to compute V for the following reason: \* V^T is an orthogonal matrix (that is, it represents a combination \* of rotations and reflexions) so that it maps the unit circle to \* itself. For this reason, the exact value of V does not affect the \* final ellipse, and we can choose V to be the identity \* matrix. This gives \* \* Jinv = U newSigma. \* \* In the end, we return the two diagonal entries of newSigma \* together with the two columns of U. \*/ /\* \* ClampUpAxes was written by Nicolas Robidoux and Chantal Racette \* of Laurentian University with insightful suggestions from Anthony \* Thyssen and funding from the National Science and Engineering \* Research Council of Canada.

## Overview

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 and 9

Red Hat understands the importance of life cycle planning for our customers, partners, ISVs, and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux ecosystem. With the introduction of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8, Red Hat simplified the RHEL product phases from four to three: Full Support, Maintenance Support, and Extended Life Phase. We are also providing information on anticipated release dates and minor releases that will offer extended support.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 and 9 delivers a ten year life cycle in Full Support and Maintenance Support Phases followed by an Extended Life Phase. In addition, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 customers may purchase annual Add-on subscriptions called Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) to extend limited subscription services beyond the Maintenance Support Phase.

#### Life Cycle[viii](#viii):

![](/sites/default/files/images/355_rhel_life_cycle_updates_0723_2.png)

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle phases are designed to reduce the level of change within each major release[i](#i) over time and make release availability and content more predictable.[ii](#ii)

## Details

During the life cycle for each major version, software changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux are delivered via individual updates known as *errata advisories* through the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/home)[iii](#iii) or other authorized Red Hat portals. Errata advisories may be released individually on an as-needed basis or aggregated as a minor release. Errata advisories will contain security fixes (Red Hat Security Advisories or RHSAs), bug fixes (Red Hat Bug Fix Advisories or RHBAs), or feature enhancements (Red Hat Enhancement Advisories or RHEAs). Errata advisories are tested and qualified against the active Red Hat Enterprise Linux major release. (For example, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 RHSA will be applied cumulatively to the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 version and patch set.) Released errata advisories remain accessible to active subscribers for the entire Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle. Within each major release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, any errata advisory (including one released as part of a minor release) will be applied cumulatively to the latest release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, including any patch sets.

During the life cycle of a major Red Hat Enterprise Linux release, Red Hat makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain binary compatibility for the core runtime environment across all minor releases and errata advisories. If necessary, Red Hat may make exceptions to this compatibility goal for Critical impact security or other significant issues. Furthermore, major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux contain a limited set of backward-compatible libraries included in previous major releases to allow for the easy migration of applications. Typically, Red Hat applies changes in such a way as to minimize the amount of change and to maintain binary compatibility. Exceptions may apply for controlled package re-bases under certain circumstances. The binary compatibility goal is extended to Red Hat Enterprise Linux for use in an application container. Additional details can be found in the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8: Application Compatibility Guide](/articles/rhel8-abi-compatibility), or the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9: Application Compatibility Guide](/articles/rhel9-abi-compatibility).

The following table details the subscription services, including support and software maintenance, performed during each phase of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle:

1. Technical Support access depends on the Service Level included in your Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscription.
2. Red Hat may choose, as a temporary measure, to address those catastrophic issues with a significant customer business impact with a Hotfix while the Bug Fix errata advisory (RHBA) is being created.
3. Native hardware enablement is provided by backporting hardware drivers, etc., to the relevant version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Hardware enablement using virtualization is achieved by running an earlier version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a virtual guest on a newer version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. See the [Virtualization](#Virtualization) description below for details. NOTE: Hardware certification (including the associated hardware limits) applies to the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that is being used as the host.
4. Intentionally left blank.
5. Software enhancements are additions of new functionality beyond correcting defects or enabling previously existing functionality on a new hardware generation.
6. Major releases are the primary vehicle for significant software enhancements, although low-impact software enhancement may also be delivered in minor releases.
7. See the [Extended Life Phase](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Phase) description below.
8. Extended Update Support (EUS), Enhanced Extended Update Support (Enhanced EUS), and Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) are available as optional add-ons. See the [EUS](#Extended_Update_Support), [Enhanced EUS,](#Enhanced_Extended_Update_Support) and [ELS](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Support) descriptions below.
9. For existing installations only. See details [below](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Phase) for other limitations.
10. See the [Issue Severity Classification](/site/security/updates/classification/) page for security severity classifications.
11. All errata provided at Red Hat's discretion.

14. Updated installation image provided at first minor release GA date.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Production Phases

### Full Support Phase[iv](#iv):

During the Full Support Phase, [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important Security errata advisories (RHSAs) and Urgent and Selected (at Red Hat discretion) High Priority Bug Fix errata advisories (RHBAs) will be released as they become available. Other errata advisories may be delivered as appropriate.

If available, new or improved hardware enablement and select enhanced software functionality may be provided at the discretion of Red Hat, generally in minor releases. Hardware enablement that does not require substantial software changes may be provided independent from minor releases at Red Hat's discretion.

Minor releases will also include available and qualified errata advisories (RHSAs, RHBAs, and RHEAs). Minor releases are cumulative and include the contents of previously released updates. The focus for minor releases during this phase lies on resolving defects of medium or higher priority.

Updated installation images will be provided for minor releases during the Full Support Phase.

### Maintenance Support Phase :

During the Maintenance Support Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 & 9 [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact Security Advisories (RHSAs) and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs) will be released as they become available. Other errata advisories may be delivered as appropriate.

New functionality and new hardware enablement are not planned for availability in the Maintenance Support Phase.

### Extended Life Phase:

During the Extended Life Phase, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription provides continued access to previously released content on the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/home), as well as other content such as documentation and the Red Hat Knowledgebase. Advice for migrating to currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions may also be provided.

For versions of products in the Extended Life Phase, Red Hat will provide limited ongoing technical support. No bug fixes, security fixes, hardware enablement or root-cause analysis will be available during this phase, and support will be provided on existing installations only.

Red Hat reserves the right to terminate the ongoing support in the Extended Life Phase for a particular version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux at any time.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 Life Cycle Red Hat is providing further predictability for Red Hat Enterprise Linux customers, partners, and ISVs. The below map provides details on when minor releases are planned, and which minor releases will include Extended Update Support and Update Services for SAP Solutions. Minor releases are planned for release every six months through the Full Support phase. RHEL 8 Planning Guide[viii](#viii) RHEL 9 Planning Guide[viii](#viii)

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux Application Streams Life Cycle

The vast majority of packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 8 & 9, including most Application Streams, will be maintained for the full 10 year Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle. Specified life cycle components, however, will be maintained for less than 10 years, with a specified life cycle often matching the upstream life of the component.

Application Streams will adhere to the errata criteria for the Production Phase of the major release. For example, errata released for an Application Stream for RHEL 8 or 9 during the Maintenance Support Phase will be confined to [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact Security Advisories (RHSAs) and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs). Similarly, no new Application Streams will be released during the Maintenance Support Phase and Extended Life Phase since Software Enhancements are not permitted during these phases. However, to achieve the 10 years support criteria for RHEL, one version of each Application Stream will be identified at the start of the Maintenance Support Phase and that version will receive maintenance as described by the support phases.

For example, most databases are supported upstream for 5 years and maintenance of their Application Stream in RHEL 8 or 9 will align with their upstream support. There will be overlapping PostgreSQL Application Streams in RHEL 8, with each stream maintained for 5 years. Customers may select the Application Stream version that best meets their needs. They can install an older version, install a newer version and stay on it for the full 5 years, or update to the latest stream with each release, whatever best fits their use case. Customers never have to update, they can update at their own convenience. If a customer asks for support beyond the specified life of an Application Stream, they may be asked to move to a newer Application Stream to take advantage of bug fixes and CVE advisories.

Please see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Application Streams Life Cycle](/support/policy/updates/rhel-app-streams-life-cycle) page for more information.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extended Maintenance

### Extended Update Support Add-on[vii](#vii)

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 EUS Maintenance Policy; and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 EUS/Enhanced EUS Maintenance Policy

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Extended Update Support maintenance policy; and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Extended Update Support/Enhanced Extended Update Support maintenance policy consist of addressing (a) security related issues for active software packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 & 9, and (b) Urgent bugs for a specified list of packages as detailed below.

#### Security Maintenance

* Red Hat may provide security fixes for [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important CVEs for packages within Red Hat Enterprise Linux as long as the package is not in end of life.
* Packages within RHEL 8 or 9 Application Streams may have a shorter life cycle than a specific RHEL minor release

+ Please refer to the Application Streams life cycle section for more details

* The policy applies ONLY on current active minor releases per the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle policy
* Definition of Critical and Important Impact CVEs is defined by the [Red Hat Security Policy](/security/updates/classification)

#### Bug Fix Maintenance

* The inclusions list below is a minimum set of packages that apply to Urgent bug fixes.

+ bind, bash, chrony, grub2, grubby, glibc, gnutls, httpd, kernel, libgcrypt, libvirt, nss, openssh, openssl, python 3.6 (RHEL 8), python 3.9 (RHEL 9), qemu-kvm, rpm, sudo, systemd, wget, yum / dnf

* Urgent bugs not on the list may be addressed at Red Hat discretion.
* The policy applies ONLY on current active minor releases per the Red Hat Enterprise LInux Life Cycle Policy.

**Note:** Active minor releases refers to the period of time a specific minor release is maintained. For example, RHEL 9.0 with EUS is active for 24 months from general availability.

### Update Services for SAP Solutions Red Hat offers Update Services for SAP Solutions (E4S) on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions subscription for those customers who wish to standardize on a specific minor release for an extended period of time. The Update Services for SAP Solutions allows customers the flexibility to decide when to take advantage of new Red Hat Enterprise Linux features, including new hardware enablement. Under a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, all available RHSAs and RHBAs are provided for the current active minor release until the availability of the next minor release. By contrast, EUS and Update Services for SAP Solutions deliver—for a specific minor release—an independent, extended stream of those [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact RHSAs and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority RHBAs that are available after that specific minor release and in parallel to subsequent minor releases. For EUS and Update Services for SAP Solutions subscribers, Red Hat generally will continue to proactively provide [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact RHSAs independent of customer requests if and when available.

### Extended Life-cycle Support Add-On:

### RHEL 6 Extended Life-cycle Support Add-On:

Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) is an optional Add-On subscription for certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions. The ELS Add-on is available during the Extended Life Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 ELS delivers certain Red Hat defined Critical and Important security fixes and selected (at Red Hat discretion) urgent priority bug fixes and troubleshooting for the [last minor release](#Life_Cycle_Dates).

* [**RHEL 6 ELS Inclusion List**](/articles/4997301).

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the ELS Add-On covers the IBM z Systems and the x86 architecture, both 32-bit and 64-bit variants. Add-Ons are not covered by ELS.

For guidance on how to best modernize your Red Hat infrastructure with a solution that meets your business needs, contact Red Hat Consulting.

**Note:** Only Standard or Premium subscriptions to RHEL Server are eligible for ELS Support. RHEL Desktop or RHEL Workstation subscriptions are not eligible for ELS.

### RHEL 7 Extended Life-cycle Support Add-On:

Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) is an optional Add-On subscription for certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions. The ELS Add-on is available during the Extended Life Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ELS delivers certain Red Hat defined Critical and Important security fixes and selected (at Red Hat discretion) urgent priority bug fixes and troubleshooting for the [last minor release](#Life_Cycle_Dates).

* [**Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support Maintenance Policy.**](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhel7-els-support-maintenance-policy).

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the ELS Add-On covers the IBM z Systems and the x86 architecture (64-bit only). Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support also includes maintenance for Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions, Red Hat Enterprise Linux High Availability add-on, and the Resilient Storage add-on.

Only Standard or Premium subscriptions to RHEL Server are eligible for ELS Support. RHEL Desktop or RHEL Workstation subscriptions are not eligible for ELS.

**Note:** RHEL ELS should be purchased before the start date of the ELS period (June 30, 2024 for RHEL 7 ELS). Otherwise, the ELS Add-on subscription must be back-dated to the RHEL ELS period start date

## Virtualization

Virtualization provides hardware abstraction for guest operating systems. Abstraction allows a guest that is running an older version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that does not support the latest server hardware to be easily deployed on a virtualization host that does. In this way, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 guest can be hosted by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 on a latest-generation processor.

Red Hat intends to support those versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that are still within the Production or Extended Life Phase when run as virtualized guests on later versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The [Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualization support matrix](http://www.redhat.com/resourcelibrary/articles/enterprise-linux-virtualization-support) provides details on the supported combinations of operating systems, versions, and hardware architectures.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1928941#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-02-15 20:26:40 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/resample.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.10-62.  Upstream issue:  <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/3195>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1928941#c1)  Todd Cullum    2021-02-17 20:14:51 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/8d25d94a363b104acd6ff23df7470aeedb806c51>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1928941#c2)  Todd Cullum    2021-02-17 20:25:48 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  If resample_filter->support is set to 0, a divide-by-zero can occur on 2 lines of ScaleResampleFilter() in MagickCore/resample.c. Because the resample_filter is acquired from the image[1], a crafted image could potentially trigger this flaw and cause a crash, affecting application availability.  1. <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/8d25d94a363b104acd6ff23df7470aeedb806c51/MagickCore/resample.c>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1928941#c3)  Todd Cullum    2021-02-17 20:27:59 UTC  ``` Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-8 [[bug 1929886](show_bug.cgi?id=1929886 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-20246 ImageMagick: Division by zero in ScaleResampleFilter in MagickCore/resample.c [epel-8]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1929887](show_bug.cgi?id=1929887 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-20246 ImageMagick: Division by zero in ScaleResampleFilter in MagickCore/resample.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1928941#c4)  Todd Cullum    2021-02-17 20:35:36 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.
