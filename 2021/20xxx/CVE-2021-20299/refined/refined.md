Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a null-dereference read within the `Imf_2_5::Header::operator` of the OpenEXR library when processing a malformed multipart image file. Specifically, this occurs when a multipart input file contains no actual parts/headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access a member of a null pointer, leading to a crash.
- **Missing Sanity Check:** The code lacks a check to ensure that a multipart file contains at least one header before attempting to access it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation results in a crash, leading to a denial of service. The affected application processing the malicious image file will terminate abruptly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image File:** The primary attack vector is a crafted malicious OpenEXR image file with no parts/headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with the crafted malicious OpenEXR file. This could involve:
    - Sending the file as an attachment (e.g., through email or messaging).
    - Serving the file via a website that the application accesses.
    - Exploiting a file upload functionality.
    - Any other scenario where a crafted file can be processed by the vulnerable software.
- No specific attacker privilege is required beyond the ability to provide the crafted file to the target application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the handling of multipart OpenEXR image files, where the code does not properly validate the number of parts present.
- The fix for this issue includes a sanity check to ensure that the multipart file contains at least one header.
- The vulnerability is fixed in OpenEXR version 3.0.0-beta
