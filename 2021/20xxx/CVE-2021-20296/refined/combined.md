Debian Bug     : 986796 990450

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenEXR, a library and
tools for the OpenEXR high dynamic-range (HDR) image format. An
attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) through application
crash and excessive memory consumption.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.0-11+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in OpenEXR, command-line
tools and a library for the OpenEXR image format. Buffer overflows or
out-of-bound reads could lead to a denial of service (application crash) if
a malformed image file is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.1-4.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>
