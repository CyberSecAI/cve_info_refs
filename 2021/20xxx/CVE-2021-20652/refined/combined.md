## Description

### Name Directory: Build your own glossary!

This plugin adds name/term directories (glossaries) to your WordPress installation.

The output on your website is like a glossary/index, including a search function.

This plugin supports **multiple directories** in one WordPress installation.

I recommend you to take a look at the screenshots, they illustrate more than words.

The Name Directory plugin was originally developed for [ParkietenVilla.nl](https://www.parkietenvilla.nl/namenlijst/) to show a directory of names to name your budgies.

#### Create multiple directories and customize them!

You can create multiple directories with this plugin.

Every directory can be embedded with a very simple shortcode which you can just copy-and-paste

in your own pages and posts. Every directory has a few configuration options that customize

the layout and functionality of the directory:

* Show/Hide title
* Show/Hide description
* Enter the subject of the directory (i.e.: movies, birds, countries, names)
* Show/Hide suggestion form
* Show/Hide submitter name
* Show/Hide search function (searches names/titles and description)
* Show/Hide a horizontal rule between the entries
* Show/Hide all entries when the user has not chosen an index-letter yet
* Show/Hide the newest entries (and choose an amount of newest entries to show)
* Choose the amount of columns to display
* Whether to jump to the name directory when a visitor is using the search box (for onepage websites)
* When you embed a directory, you can configure it to start with a letter of your choosing. E.g.: start on letter J.
* You can limit the amount of words in the description (and display a “Read more” link which reveals the rest of the text

The administration view of this plugin has the familiar look and feel of (the rest of) the WordPress Administration panel.

I have done my best to enable some AJAX-features in the administration panel, so you can work efficiently while adding new entries.

Since v1.7 and v1.8, simple import and export functionality is also supported through .csv-files.

This plugin is also tested compatible with:

\* the popular [Members plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/) which makes role permissions easy

\* [Relevanssi plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/), the better search plugin

#### Try the plugin without installing it yourself.

Do you want to try Name Directory instantly? Thanks to TasteWP, you can start with an empty demo-site, just for you!

Also, it’s free.

[Click here to create the instant demo-website with Name Directory installed](https://demo.tastewp.com/name-directory).

#### Embed the directory in the WordPress default search engine

When you go to the General Settings of the plugin, you can enable WordPress search compatibility.

This will include the pages who have a matching entry of Name Directory in the search results

#### Language support

Do you want Name Directory to be available in your language?

Please help us translate!

You can translate directly by going to <https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/name-directory>,

login with your WordPress account and click Select your language and click ‘Contribute Translation’.

## Installation

#### Displaying a directory on your site

1. Go to the Name Directory settings page
2. Hover over the directory you want to add to the page.
3. A few options should show now, like Delete, Manage and Shortcode (see screenshot https://ps.w.org/name-directory/assets/screenshot-2.png).
4. Click ‘Shortcode’, a little textbox will show now.
5. Copy-and-paste the content of the textbox into the page you want the plugin to show up.
6. Save and view the page to see the result.

#### What does the shortcode look like?

The shortcode for this Name Directory plugin is like this:

[namedirectory dir=1]

#### Installing the plugin

Installation is very easy. You can just download this plugin through the Plugin Finder in your WordPress Administration Panel.

If you download the zip-file, installation isn’t that difficult either:

1. Unzip the file which results into a directory called `name-directory`
2. Upload that directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
4. Create a new name directory and add some names
5. Copy the shortcode and paste it into a post or page to show it on your website

## FAQ

### What does the shortcode look like?

The shortcode for this Name Directory plugin is like this:

[namedirectory dir=1]

The `1` in this example is the internal ID of the directory, the rest of the shortcode should always look like this.

### I created a directory, how do I show it on my site?

1. Go to the Name Directory settings page
2. Hover over the directory you want to add to the page.
3. A few options should show now, like Delete, Manage and Shortcode – see screenshot https://ps.w.org/name-directory/assets/screenshot-2.png
4. Click ‘Shortcode’, a little textbox will show now.
5. Copy-and-paste the content of the textbox into the page you want the plugin to show up.
6. Save and view the page to see the result.

### Can I customize the appearance / styling of the Name Directory?

Yes you can, with CSS. If you know your way around CSS you might already know that you can style elements by their class name or HTML structure.

This plugin was written with styling / CSS in mind. Using the HTML inspector of your favourite browser you should be able to discover the classnames, but here are a few popular classes:

* `.name_directory_index`: Index links (the letters A-Z)
* `.name_directory_name_box > strong`: Name / Entry title
* `.name_directory_name_box > div`: Name / Entry descriptiong
* `.name_directory_total`: Total count of names / entries
* `.name_directory_index > form`: Search form
* `.name_directory_submit_bottom_link`: Link to submit form
* `.name_directory_active`: Currently active character on index
* `.name_directory_empty`: Indicates that there a no entries for character
* `.name_directory_character_header`: Indicates a new starting-letter header
* `#name_directory_search_input_box`: Search input box
* `#name_directory_search_input_button`: Search button

Also, I do offer help on styling / CSS if you are willing to make a small donation.

Please contact me at the [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/name-directory) or [my website](https://jeroenpeters.dev/contact) to discuss this.

### Is there a bulk-add or csv import in this plugin?

Since v1.7, yes there is! You can import a .csv-file into a directory.

1. Go to the Name Directory settings page
2. Hover over the directory you want to import names into.
3. A few options should show now, like Delete, Manage and Import – [see this screenshot](https://ps.w.org/name-directory/assets/screenshot-2.png) for an example
4. Click ‘Import’
5. Select your .csv-file
6. Upload

You can add names, descriptions and submitter entries, just the first column (name) is required. Good to know: the first row is always ignored (they should be headers).

You can download an [example import file](https://ps.w.org/name-directory/assets/name-directory-import-example.csv) to take a look at the format.

Might your first try does not work, please use https://www.freefileconvert.com to convert your file into a valid CSV file.

Also, importing works best if you export the files with ‘UTF-8’ character set, ANSI does not always work.

If you need any help, contact me on the [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/name-directory).

### Can I export my directory?

Since v1.8, yes you can! This export is also compatible with the import-functionality offcourse. If you want to export, use the following steps:

1. Go to the Name Directory settings page
2. Hover over the directory you want to export.
3. A few options should show now, like Delete, Manage, Import and also Export – [see this screenshot](https://ps.w.org/name-directory/assets/screenshot-2.png) for an example
4. Click ‘Export’
5. On the new page click the button and your .csv-file will be downloaded

### Are there demo’s / examples to see the plugin in action?

Yes, every now and then I come across an installed version of the plugin. Here is an incomplete list.

### Can I try the plugin myself before I install it?

Yes, [click here for in instant demo-website with Name Directory installed](https://demo.tastewp.com/name-directory)

### Can I use HTML in the name description?

Yes, this is possible! Please do be careful to use valid HTML only though.

### Can I use a WYSIWYG editor to edit the name description?

Yes, you can, since v1.14.1. You can enable this yourself when you go to the General Settings ([also see screenshot 7](https://ps.w.org/name-directory/assets/screenshot-7.png))

### Is it possible to be a Name Directory admin without being a Site Administrator?

Since version 1.17 his is possible by also using the [Members plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/).

Name Directory registers a capability called `manage_name_directory` there.

Whenever you give a user this capability, they will see the Name Directory admin menu’s and will be able to manage the Name Directories.

### Can I also display a random name?

Yes, since v1.12 this is possible. You can use this shortcode for that:

[namedirectory\_random dir=1]

The `1` in this example is the internal ID of the directory.

### Can I also display a single name?

Yes, since v1.13 this is possible. You can use this shortcode for that:

[namedirectory\_single id=10]

### How come some characters don’t show, or show as questionmarks?

If so, please check that your PHP version has *mb\_string* enabled. If that is the case, please check if your database is UTF-8 supported (utf8mb4\_unicode\_ci).

The `10` in this example is the internal ID of the name, you can find it in the last column when you view all names for a directory in the WordPress admin.

Also, if this does not work, there is a setting called “Show all letters on index”. If you switch this off, it should work.

### How can I contact you?

If you have questions about the plugin or if you have ideas to share, the best way to contact me is through the [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/name-directory).

If you want me to do custom, paid work for you, you can get in touch by [contacting me on website](https://jeroenpeters.dev/contact).

### Do you also offer customizations?

Yes, I do. For this I offer paid help. Please contact me at [my website](https://jeroenpeters.dev/contact) to discuss this.

### How can I report security bugs?

Lovely little plugin and very easy to use. Great support too, especially as it’s free – I wanted a tweak to get it to hide the A-Z search function and the author replied to my query really quickly with a solution.
