{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in the gnutls library's `client_send_params` function, specifically when handling the key_share extension during client-side TLS handshake. A realloc() may be called on the `extdata->data`, invalidating the client_hello.data pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to pointer invalidation after realloc."
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to memory corruption and potentially a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during a client-side TLS handshake when sending the key_share or pre_shared_key extension. It is triggered when the client sends a large Client Hello message.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to initiate a client-side TLS handshake with a server using a vulnerable version of GnuTLS and send a large Client Hello message that leads to realloc being called."
