Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20262:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing re-authentication step when a user updates their password in Keycloak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Re-authentication:** The core issue is that Keycloak does not require the user to re-authenticate before changing their password. This allows an attacker with temporary physical access to the user's browser session to change the password without needing to know the current password, or having to provide any credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker who gains temporary physical access to a user's browser can change the user's password and thus take over their account.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The bug description indicates that the highest threat is to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability as the attacker can perform malicious actions after taking over the account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker requires temporary physical access to a logged-in user's browser. This could be a laptop left unattended or a shared computer environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Temporary Physical Access:** The attacker must be able to gain brief access to an already authenticated user's browser session.
