{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the use of a static allocator with ZMTP v1 packets in zeromq. The decoder static allocator's size can be changed, but the underlying buffer remains the same (a static buffer), leading to a potential heap overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a buffer overflow WRITE of arbitrary data. This can lead to application availability issues, data integrity compromise, and confidentiality breaches.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker sends a crafted request with a malformed ZMTP v1 packet to a zeromq server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted network packet. No authentication is required if CURVE/ZAP authentication is not enabled."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_versions": "libzmq versions >= 4.2 and <= 4.3.2",
    "patched_versions": "libzmq version 4.3.3",
     "workarounds": "Enable CURVE/ZAP authentication on public endpoints"
