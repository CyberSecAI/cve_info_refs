- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a legitimate user into clicking a link to inject malicious code into the Web-Based Management interface, potentially leading to data manipulation or other malicious activities within the user's session.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, requiring user interaction. The attacker needs to craft a malicious link that, when clicked by a legitimate user, injects code into the web management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a link to the victim, and the victim must be a user of the WAGO device's web management interface and must click on the provided link. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
