#### Information

It is very inconvenient to use multiple caching plugins at the same time. That’s why you need to disable plugins such as LiteSpeed Cache, WP-Optimize, W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, SiteGround Optimizer, Breeze while using WP Fastest Cache.

WP Fastest Cache is compatible with most popular plugins such as Contact Form 7, Yoast SEO, Elementor Website Builder, Classic Editor, Akismet Spam Protection, WooCommerce, Contact Form by WPForms, Really Simple SSL, All-in-One WP Migration, Yoast Duplicate Post, Wordfence Security – Firewall & Malware Scan, WordPress Importer, UpdraftPlus WordPress Backup Plugin, MonsterInsights, All in One SEO, WP Mail SMTP by WPForms.

#### Supported Languages

Although there are over 7000 languages spoken in the world today, we feel very lucky to support 28 languages for now.

However, localizing or adapting a plugin to another language or culture is time consuming and a demanding task. That’s where the amazing Translation Contributors team of WordPress comes into play. These selfless people spent their precious time without expecting anything in return so that other people can use the add-ons more easily. We sincerely thank all of them.

Very easy to use. It made my website faster. The image optimization is also great.I had a problem with caching reviews (FeedbackWP). The support gave an important tip and I was able to solve the problem with FeedbackWP support. Within 24 hours. Very good. I can only recommend the plugin and the support.

I was skeptical about its performance because it was easy to set up and the UI was simple, but it is the fastest cache plugin. I tested numerous cache plugins.
It is the only plugin that supports preload and is fully compatible with complex themes, many plugins, and nginx.
