- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) web application uses the SameSite cookie attribute to protect against CSRF attacks. However, the ISIQ's web browser requirements were not current enough to ensure that this cookie attribute was consistently used. Older browsers might not enforce CSRF token protections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient browser requirements allowing older browsers to bypass CSRF token protection mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious user to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft malicious requests that are sent by a user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious site that sends requests to the vulnerable ISIQ application.
