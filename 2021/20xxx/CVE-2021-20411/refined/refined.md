- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server in IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) does not consistently update the session identifier when a new user logs in.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Session fixation vulnerability due to the web server not always generating a new session identifier upon login.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could commandeer a previously used session identifier, impersonating a legitimate user.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by gaining control of a session ID, allowing them to impersonate a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to obtain a valid session identifier from a legitimate user and then use it to gain access.
