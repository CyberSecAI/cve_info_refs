Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-20591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper session management in the MELSOFT transmission port (TCP/IP) of MELSEC iQ-R series CPU modules. Specifically, the issue is related to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled Resource Consumption: The system does not properly manage resources associated with open TCP/IP connections, leading to resource exhaustion.
- Improper Session Management: The vulnerability stems from the system's inability to properly handle and close TCP/IP connections, allowing an attacker to keep connections open indefinitely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can exhaust the resources of the MELSOFT transmission port (TCP/IP) by not closing connections, making the port unavailable for legitimate users.
- Legitimate clients will be unable to connect to the affected port, disrupting communication.
- Sequence control is not affected.
- If multiple ports are in use, other ports remain unaffected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker exploits the vulnerability over the network by sending requests to the MELSOFT transmission port (TCP/IP) and then not properly closing the connection.
- Remote attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the targeted device's MELSOFT transmission port (TCP/IP).
- No authentication or specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all firmware versions of the listed MELSEC iQ-R series CPU modules.
- The affected port is 5007.
- Workarounds include using the forced connection invalidation function and re-enabling the port to restore access for legitimate clients. Mitigations include using a firewall, VPN, IP filter function, or switching to the MELSOFT transmission port (UDP/IP).
