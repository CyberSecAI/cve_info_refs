  "CVE-2021-20121": {
    "description": "The Telus Wi-Fi Hub (PRV65B444A-S-TS) with firmware version 3.00.20 is vulnerable to an authenticated arbitrary file read. An authenticated user with physical access to the device can read arbitrary files from the device by preparing and connecting a specially prepared USB drive to the device, and making a series of crafted requests to the device's web interface.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the device's DLNA/UPnP media server following symbolic links created on a connected USB drive, allowing access to arbitrary files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted access to file system via symbolic link following",
      "Inadequate input validation in the media server component"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the device's filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files or credentials.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the device",
      "Attacker-controlled USB drive",
      "Manipulation of web interface requests to share specific folders"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs physical access to the device, a formatted USB drive, and authentication credentials for the device's web interface. The attacker also needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests."

   "CVE-2021-20122": {
        "description": "The Telus Wi-Fi Hub (PRV65B444A-S-TS) with firmware version 3.00.20 is affected by an authenticated command injection vulnerability in multiple parameters passed to tr69_cmd.cgi. A remote attacker connected to the router's LAN and authenticated with a super user account, or using a bypass authentication vulnerability like CVE-2021-20090 could leverage this issue to run commands or gain a shell as root on the target device.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the parameters passed to `tr69_cmd.cgi`, specifically in the `tr69_username` parameter which is then used in a `system()` call.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Command injection vulnerability",
             "Lack of input sanitization",
             "Use of `system()` function with unsanitized user input",
             "Insecure handling of TR-069 parameters"
        ],
        "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device as root, potentially gaining full control over the device.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Remote access to the device's LAN",
            "Authenticated access to the device's web interface (or through an authentication bypass)",
            "Manipulation of the tr69_username parameter"
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be on the same LAN as the router, have administrative credentials or have leveraged another vulnerability like CVE-2021-20090 to bypass authentication, and be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the device."
