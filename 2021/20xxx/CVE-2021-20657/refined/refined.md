Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20657:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content explicitly mentions CVE-2021-20657 in relation to "Improper access control" in the "SolarView Compact" product. This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is an "Improper access control" issue within the SolarView Compact software. Specifically, authentication can be bypassed by directly entering a URL to access pages that should require authentication.
   - The document also identifies a second access control issue: a text editor is accessible within the web application, which allows editing of arbitrary files.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** The primary weakness is the failure to properly enforce access controls, allowing unauthorized access to setting information.
   - **Missing Authentication:** Authentication is bypassed by directly inputting a URL.
   - **Unrestricted File Editing:** A text editor allows modification of system files.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - An attacker with access can obtain or alter settings information without proper authorization.
   - With the text editor vulnerability, an attacker can also modify information, or create malicious programs.
   - An attacker with administrative privileges can log in and perform unintended operations.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can bypass authentication by directly inputting URLs for protected pages.
   - **Web-based Text Editor:** Attackers can access and use the web-based text editor to alter system files.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the SolarView Compact device.
   - **User Level Access (Initially):** The attacker must be able to interact with the web interface to some extent, but is not required to have valid credentials.
   - Some attacks may require admin access, however, this is not a prerequisite for this particular CVE.

**Additional Notes:**

- The document provides more details than the basic CVE description by specifying the attack vector using direct URL access to bypass authentication. It also describes a second access control weakness.
- The content also highlights several other vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-20656, CVE-2021-20658, CVE-2021-20659, CVE-2021-20660, CVE-2021-20661, CVE-2021-20662 and several older CVEs), indicating a broader security issue with the product.
- The vendor recommends updating the firmware to version 6.50 to fix this vulnerability and provides some workarounds to mitigate the risk until an update can be performed.
