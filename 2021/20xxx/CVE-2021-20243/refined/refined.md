Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20243:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error in the `GetResizeFilterWeight` function within the `MagickCore/resize.c` file of the ImageMagick library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero: The code lacks proper checks to prevent a division by zero when calculating filter weights during image resizing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to undefined behavior, resulting in a crash or denial-of-service (DoS) due to the division by zero. While the primary impact is system availability, other undefined behavior issues could arise.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a specially crafted image file to an application that uses ImageMagick for image processing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to submit a crafted image file to an application that utilizes ImageMagick for processing.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability
- User interaction is required for exploitation as the victim application needs to process the malicious file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `GetResizeFilterWeight` function inside of `MagickCore/resize.c`.
- The vulnerability was fixed by using the `PerceptibleReciprocal()` function to prevent the divide-by-zero from occurring (commit `9751bd6`).
- The vulnerability is present in ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.10-62.
-  Red Hat stated that the flaw is out of scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.
- Debian LTS issued security advisories DLA-2672-1 and DLA-3429-1 to address this and other vulnerabilities in imagemagick.
