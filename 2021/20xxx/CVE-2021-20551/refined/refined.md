- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Some browsers, including Internet Explorer, may cache content accessed via HTTPS. If sensitive information in application responses is stored in the local cache, then this may be retrieved by other users who have access to the same computer at a future time.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure caching of sensitive information by browsers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information by other users who have access to the same computer.
- **Attack vectors:** Shared computer environment where multiple users have access to the same system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must have access to the computer where the browser cached sensitive data.
