Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20638:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **OS command injection** flaw present in the web management interface of the affected Logitec product (LAN-W300N/PGRB).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The device's web management page does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation enables the attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands. This can lead to a complete compromise of the device, including the ability to:
    *   Read and modify files.
    *   Install malware.
    *   Join the device to a botnet.
    *   Disrupt network operations.
    *   Potentially pivot to other systems within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface Access:** The attacker must have the ability to access the web management interface of the affected device. This typically implies:
    *   Being on the same network as the device, potentially within the same LAN, if the web interface is not exposed to the internet.
    *   Having the correct credentials to log in, which may be gained through various attacks.
    *   If the device has UPnP enabled it is possible to exploit without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have the ability to reach its web interface.
*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface and log in as an administrator.
*   If UPnP is enabled no authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability report states that the affected product is no longer supported, and users should stop using the devices and upgrade to current models.
*   The vendor confirms this vulnerability on their website.
