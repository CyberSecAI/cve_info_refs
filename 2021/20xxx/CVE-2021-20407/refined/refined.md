Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The source code of a Node.js package used by IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) included a developer's email address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Exposure of sensitive information (a developer's email address) within the source code. This is a form of information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential disclosure of a developer's email address. This could be used for:
    - Targeted phishing attacks against the developer.
    - Social engineering attempts.
    - Possible reconnaissance for other attacks, by identifying the developer's work patterns.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is not directly exploitable remotely. The primary attack vector would be access to the ISIQ source code. This could include scenarios like:
     - A malicious insider with access to the source code.
     - An attacker who has breached systems hosting the source code repository, or has access to the container image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) source code (either from the repository, container image or other source).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is resolved in ISIQ version 10.0.0 and later.
- No workarounds are available for the impacted versions of ISIQ (1.0.6, 1.0.7).
- The fix was to remove the sensitive information (developer's email) from the source code.
- The impact is considered to be low because it's an information leak.
