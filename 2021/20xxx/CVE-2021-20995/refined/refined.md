Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The web server cookies of the web-based user interface (UI) contain user credentials in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to user credentials by accessing the cookies, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the device's web-based management interface.
- The attacker could potentially access sensitive information or perform actions on the device with the stolen credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack, by intercepting network traffic containing the cookies or by gaining access to the device's network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the WAGO device.
- No specific user interaction is needed, meaning it can be passively exploited by an attacker capable of network interception.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability arises from storing user credentials in clear text within web server cookies. An attacker with network access can intercept these cookies and extract the credentials to gain unauthorized access to the device's web interface.
