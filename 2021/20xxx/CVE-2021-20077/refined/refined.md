Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-20077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Nessus Agent (versions 7.2.0 through 8.2.2) inadvertently captured the IAM role security token on the local host during the initial linking process when installed on an Amazon EC2 instance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper handling of sensitive credentials (IAM role security token) during the initial linking process.
-  The token was stored in a location where it could be accessed by a privileged attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A privileged attacker could obtain the captured IAM role security token, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources within the AWS environment associated with the role.
- The impact is limited to an information disclosure and does not seem to offer a way for a attacker to gain code execution or disrupt a service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access on the host where the Nessus Agent is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A privileged attacker would need to have local access to the host.
- According to the CVSSv3 vector (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) the attacker would need to have high privileges on the local machine.

**Additional Notes:**

- Tenable released Nessus Agent version 8.2.3 to address this vulnerability and other issues, including updating OpenSSL.
- The vulnerability is specific to Nessus Agents installed on Amazon EC2 instances during the initial linking process.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS v2 base score of 1.7 with the vector `(AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)` and a CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 with the vector `AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
