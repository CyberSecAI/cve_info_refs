 Announcing Privoxy 3.0.34 stable
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Privoxy 3.0.34 fixes a few minor bugs and comes with a couple of
general improvements and new features.
Please note that Google started to bounce messages from the Privoxy
mailing lists a couple of months ago. As a result gmail users have
been unsubscribed by Mailman. If you are affected by this, please
resubscribe with a different mail address. The Privoxy project has
limited resources and limited time to investigate an issue that
only affects gmail addresses.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog for Privoxy 3.0.34
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug fixes:
- Improve the handling of chunk-encoded responses by buffering the data
even if filters are disabled and properly keeping track of where the
various chunks are supposed to start and end. Previously Privoxy would
merely check the last bytes received to see if they looked like the
last-chunk. This failed to work if the last-chunk wasn't received in one
read and could also result in actual data being misdetected
as last-chunk.
Should fix: SF support request #1739.
Reported by: withoutname.
- remove\_chunked\_transfer\_coding(): Refuse to de-chunk invalid data
Previously the data could get corrupted even further.
Now we simply pass the unmodified data to the client.
- gif\_deanimate(): Tolerate multiple image extensions in a row.
This allows to deanimate all the gifs on:
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Animated\_smilies
Fixes SF bug #795 reported by Celejar.
- OpenSSL generate\_host\_certificate(): Use X509\_get\_subject\_name()
instead of X509\_get\_issuer\_name() to get the issuer for generated
website certificates so there are no warnings in the browser when using
an intermediate CA certificate instead of a self-signed root certificate.
Problem reported and patch submitted by Chakib Benziane.
- can\_filter\_request\_body(): Fix a log message that contained a spurious u.
- handle\_established\_connection(): Check for pending TLS data from the client
before checking if data is available on the connection.
The TLS library may have already consumed all the data from the client
response in which case poll() and select() will not detect that data is
available to be read.
Sponsored by: Robert Klemme.
- ssl\_send\_certificate\_error(): Don't crash if there's no certificate
information available. This is only relevant when Privoxy is built with
wolfSSL 5.0.0 or later (code not yet published). Earlier wolfSSL versions
or the other TLS backends don't seem to trigger the crash.
- socks5\_connect(): Add support for target hosts specified as IPv4 address
Previously the IP address was sent as domain.
- General improvements:
- Add a client-body-tagger action which creates tags based on
the content of the request body.
Sponsored by: Robert Klemme.
- When client-body filters are enabled, buffer the whole request
before opening a connection to the server.
Makes it less likely that the server connection times out
and we don't open a connection if the buffering fails anyway.
Sponsored by: Robert Klemme.
- Add periods to a couple of log messages.
- accept\_connection(): Add missing space to a log message.
- Initialize ca-related defaults with strdup\_or\_die() so errors
aren't silently ignored.
- make\_path: Use malloc\_or\_die() in cases where allocation errors
were already fatal anyway.
- handle\_established\_connection(): Improve an error message slightly.
- receive\_client\_request(): Reject https URLs without CONNECT request.
- Include all requests in the statistics if mutexes are available.
Previously in case of reused connections only the last request got
counted. The statistics still aren't perfect but it's an improvement.
- Add read\_socks\_reply() and start using it in socks5\_connect()
to apply the socket timeout more consistently.
- socks5\_connect(): Deal with domain names in the socks reply
- Add a filter for bundeswehr.de that hides the cookie and
privacy info banner.
- Action file improvements:
- Disable filter{banners-by-size} for .freiheitsfoo.de/.
- Disable filter{banners-by-size} for freebsdfoundation.org/.
- Disable fast-redirects for consent.youtube.com/.
- Block requests to ups.xplosion.de/.
- Block requests for elsa.memoinsights.com/t.
- Fix a typo in a test.
- Disable fast-redirects for launchpad.net/.
- Unblock .eff.org/.
- Stop unblocking .org/.\*(image|banner) which appears to be too generous
It let requests like:
https://stats.noblogs.org/piwik.php?action\_name=anti%20gentrifizierungs%20fest&idsite=10175&rec=1&r=220192&h=17&m=7&s=44&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmuellemcalling.noblogs.org%2F&urlref=https%3A%2F%2Fmuellemcalling.noblogs.org%2Finfostande%2F&\_id=&\_idn=1&\_refts=0&send\_image=0&cookie=1&res=1366x768&pv\_id=eqr7jX&pf\_net=7&pf\_srv=3&pf\_tfr=2281&pf\_dm1=156
pass.
The example URL http://www.gnu.org/graphics/gnu-head-banner.png is
already unblocked due to .gnu.org being unblocked.
- Unblock adfd.org/.
- Disable filter{banners-by-link} for .eff.org/.
- Block requests to odb.outbrain.com/.
- Disable fast-redirects for .gandi.net/.
- Disable fast-redirects{} for .onion/.\*/status/.
- Disable fast-redirects{} for twitter.com/.\*/status/.
- Unblock pinkstinks.de/.
- Disable fast-redirects for .hagalil.com/.
- Privoxy-Log-Parser:
- Bump version to 0.9.5.
- Highlight more log messages.
- Highlight the Crunch reason only once. Previously the "crunch reason"
could also be highlighted when the URL contained a matching string.
The real crunch reason only occurs once per line, so there's no need
to continue looking for it after it has been found once.
While at it, add a comment with an example log line.
- uagen:
- Bump version to 1.2.4.
- Update BROWSER\_VERSION and BROWSER\_REVISION to 102.0
to match the User-Agent of the current Firefox ESR.
- Explicitly document that changing the 'Gecko token' is suspicious.
- Consistently use a lower-case 'c' as copyright symbol.
- Bump copyright.
- Add 'aarch64' as Linux architecture.
- Add OpenBSD architecture 'arm64'.
- Stop using sparc64 as FreeBSD architecture.
It hasn't been supported for a while now.
- Build system:
- Makefile: Add a 'dok' target that depends on the 'error' target
to show the "You are not using GNU make or did nor run configure"
message.
- configure: Fix --with-msan option.
Also (probably) reported by Andrew Savchenko.
- macOS build system:
- Enable HTTPS inspection when building the macOS binary
(using OpenSSL as TLS library).
- Documentation:
- Add OpenSSL to the list of libraries that may be licensed under the
Apache 2.0 license in which case the linked Privoxy binary has to be
distributed under the GPLv3 or later.
- config: Fix the documented ca-directory default value.
Reported by avoidr.
- Rebuild developer-manual and tidy with 'HTML Tidy for FreeBSD version 5.8.0'.
- Update developer manual with new macOS packaging instructions.
- Note that the FreeBSD installation instructions work for
ElectroBSD as well.
- Note that FreeBSD/ElectroBSD users can try to install Privoxy
as binary package using 'pkg'.

About Privoxy:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling
access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and
tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user
networks.
Privoxy is Free Software and licensed under the GNU GPLv2 or later.
Our TODO list is rather long. Helping hands and donations are welcome:
\* https://www.privoxy.org/participate
\* https://www.privoxy.org/donate
At present, Privoxy is known to run on Windows 95 and later versions
(98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 10 etc.), GNU/Linux
(RedHat, SuSE, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Slackware and others),
Mac OS X (10.4 and upwards on PPC and Intel processors), Haiku,
DragonFly, ElectroBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris,
and various other flavors of Unix.
In addition to the core features of ad blocking and cookie management,
Privoxy provides many supplemental features, that give the end-user
more control, more privacy and more freedom:
\* Supports "Connection: keep-alive". Outgoing connections can be kept
alive independently from the client. Currently not available on all
platforms.
\* Supports IPv6, provided the operating system does so too,
and the configure script detects it.
\* Supports tagging which allows to change the behaviour based on client
and server headers.
\* Supports https inspection which allows to filter https requests.
\* Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need to
configure browsers individually.
\* Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server and
client headers.
\* Can be chained with other proxies.
\* Integrated browser based configuration and control utility at
http://config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/). Browser-based
tracing of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.
\* Web page filtering (text replacements, removes banners based on size,
invisible "web-bugs" and HTML annoyances, etc.)
\* Modularized configuration that allows for standard settings and user
settings to reside in separate files, so that installing updated actions
files won't overwrite individual user settings.
\* Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the configuration
files, and a more sophisticated and flexible configuration syntax.
\* GIF de-animation.
\* Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).
\* User-customizable HTML templates for most proxy-generated pages (e.g.
"blocked" page).
\* Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.
\* Most features are controllable on a per-site or per-location basis.
