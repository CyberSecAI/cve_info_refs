# Security Bulletin: IBM Spectrum Protect Plus has Insecure File Permissions due to not setting the Sticky Bit (CVE-2021-20490)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Spectrum Protect Plus has several directories that are failing security scans due to the sticky bit not being set on world-writable files.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2021-20490](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-20490)

## Affected Products and Versions

1. In the main menu screen of Spectrum Protect Plus, click on the "Jobs and Operations" tab.
2. In the "Jobs and Operations" tab, click on the "Schedule" sub-tab.
3. From the list of jobs, select "Maintenance job".
4. Click the "Start" button to initiate the job.
5. Sticky bit will be set once the maintenance job has completed.
