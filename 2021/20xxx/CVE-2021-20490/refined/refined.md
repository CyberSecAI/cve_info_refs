Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that IBM Spectrum Protect Plus has several directories with world-writable files that are missing the sticky bit. The sticky bit, when set on a directory, prevents users from deleting or renaming files within the directory unless they own the file, own the directory or are the superuser, thus protecting the files inside the directories. 

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The core issue is the lack of the sticky bit on world-writable directories. This allows any user with write access to the directory to potentially modify or delete files belonging to other users within those directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could potentially delete or modify files in these world-writable directories, leading to data loss or corruption. This could have a significant impact on the functionality and stability of the system.
*   **Potential Escalation:**  While not explicitly mentioned, the ability to modify files could lead to further exploitation, depending on the role of the affected files in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system would need to identify the world-writable directories lacking the sticky bit.
*   **Malicious User:** An attacker with user account on the system could exploit the lack of sticky bit if the vulnerable directories are accessible to the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to the system where IBM Spectrum Protect Plus is installed.
*   The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to write to the vulnerable directories.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM Spectrum Protect Plus versions 10.1.0 through 10.1.8.
*   The fix is included in version 10.1.8 patch 1. This patch sets the sticky bit during a maintenance job.
*   A workaround does not exist.
*   The maintenance job has to be scheduled or manually started to set the sticky bits
