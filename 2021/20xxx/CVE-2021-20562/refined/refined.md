Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the mailbox component of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization of the "securetoken" parameter in specific JSP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the "securetoken" parameter of the affected JSP files before rendering it in the HTML output.
- Cookie Handling: The exploitability is dependent on the state of specific cookies ("SCI_DLSSO" and "JSESSIONID"), where a valid "SCI_DLSSO" cookie with an invalid or missing "JSESSIONID" cookie for the mailbox component is necessary for the attack to succeed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session when they access the vulnerable URLs.
- The injected scripts can potentially lead to:
  - Session hijacking,
  - Stealing of sensitive information (e.g. cookies, tokens),
  - Defacement of the web page,
  - Redirection to malicious websites,
  - Other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads injected into the "securetoken" parameter of the vulnerable JSP files:
  - `/mailbox/jsp/MBIList.jsp`
  - `/mailbox/jsp/MBISearch.jsp`
  - `/mailbox/jsp/MBISend.jsp`
- The attacker needs to lure the victim into clicking a specially crafted link or otherwise accessing the crafted URL in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to visit the malicious URL in their browser.
- The victim needs to have a valid "SCI_DLSSO" cookie obtained from a valid login to the dashboard. Additionally, the victim's mailbox session ("JSESSIONID" cookie) must be invalid or non-existent for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator:
  - 5.2.0.0 - 5.2.6.5_3
  - 6.0.0.0 - 6.0.3.4
  - 6.1.0.0 - 6.1.0.2
- Patches are available in versions 5.2.6.5_4, 6.0.3.5, and 6.1.0.3 or higher.
- No workaround is available.
- The vulnerability was reported to IBM by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to achieve the required cookie state and then trigger the XSS vulnerability.
