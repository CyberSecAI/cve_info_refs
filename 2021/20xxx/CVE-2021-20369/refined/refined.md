- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the use of an inadequate encryption algorithm in IBM Cloud Pak for Applications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of an inadequate encryption algorithm is the core vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The security bulletin does not specify the impact of exploitation, but it can be inferred that exploitation could lead to a compromise of the confidentiality of the data protected by the inadequate algorithm.
- **Attack vectors**: The security bulletin does not specify attack vectors
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The security bulletin does not specify attacker capabilities or positions, but it can be inferred that an attacker would need to be able to access data protected by the inadequate algorithm to exploit the vulnerability.
