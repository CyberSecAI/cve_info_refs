  "cve": "CVE-2021-20170",
  "description": "Netgear RAX43 version 1.0.3.96 makes use of hardcoded credentials. It does not appear that normal users are intended to be able to manipulate configuration backups due to the fact that they are encrypted. This encryption is accomplished via a password-protected zip file with a hardcoded password (RAX50w!a4udk). By unzipping the configuration using this password, a user can reconfigure settings not intended to be manipulated, re-zip the configuration, and restore a backup causing these settings to be changed.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The device uses a hardcoded password to encrypt configuration backups.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded credentials",
      "Insufficient protection of configuration backups"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify the router's configuration settings by exploiting the hardcoded password. This could lead to unauthorized access, denial of service, or other malicious activities.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Network access to the router's web interface"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface, download the backup, modify and restore it to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker also needs to have knowledge of the hardcoded password."
