{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `coreos-installer` program does not properly verify GPG signatures when decompressing gzip-compressed artifacts. Specifically, the `GzDecoder` stops reading after encountering the gzip trailer, failing to notify the GPG wrapper that the end of the input stream has not been reached. This prevents the GPG wrapper from checking the exit status of the GPG process, allowing an attacker to bypass signature verification.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper signature verification"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can substitute a crafted gzip-compressed disk image, bypassing the signature check. This can lead to the installation of unsigned or malicious content, potentially granting the attacker full control over the installed system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Installing with `--image-file`, `--image-url`, or `coreos.inst.image_url`, where a user has a local mirror of installation images that can be replaced by an attacker.",
      "`coreos-installer download --decompress --image-url`, where the image source can be controlled by an attacker.",
     "Installing with default parameters, when not using live install media with osmet, if the Red Hat-controlled S3 bucket is compromised or the HTTPS connection is successfully MITMed.",
      "`coreos-installer download --decompress`, if the S3 bucket is compromised or the HTTPS connection is MITMed."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to modify the installation image, either by having access to a local mirror, compromising the hosting service, or by performing a man-in-the-middle attack on the HTTPS connection."
