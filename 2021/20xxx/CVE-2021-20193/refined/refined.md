Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20193:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `read_header()` function within the `src/list.c` file of the GNU Tar application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory Leak: The `read_header()` function, when processing specially crafted tar archive headers, fails to free memory allocated for `next_long_name` and `next_long_link` before returning under certain conditions. This results in a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By providing a specially crafted archive to the `tar` utility, an attacker can cause uncontrolled memory consumption, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- Application Availability: The memory leak can degrade the availability of the `tar` tool.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Archive: An attacker crafts a malicious tar archive with specific header structures designed to trigger the memory leak.
- User Interaction: The attacker needs to entice a user to open the crafted archive using the vulnerable `tar` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted tar archive
- Ability to deliver the crafted archive to a target user or system
- The attacker does not need to be in the same local network, a remote user can also exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was confirmed in GNU Tar versions 1.33 and earlier.
- The issue is related to the handling of extended headers in tar archives, specifically those related to long file names and links (GNUTYPE\_LONGNAME, GNUTYPE\_LONGLINK, SOLARIS\_XHDTYPE).
- A patch has been released that fixes this issue, resolving the memory leak by ensuring that `next_long_name` and `next_long_link` are freed before returning from the `read_header()` function.
- There was also out-of-bounds read detected during the fuzzing test with AddressSanitizer (ASAN), but the memory leak was the common issue.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) test case is available, confirming the memory leak.
- Gentoo has issued GLSA 202105-29, which addresses this vulnerability.
- Red Hat Bugzilla entry 1917565 tracks this CVE.
