| [Description](#c0)  Daniel Lyons    2002-02-20 02:32:44 UTC  ``` gnome-python's compile bombs out looking for capplet-widget.h.  I fixed it in the ebuild by changing the line in the GNOME section of src_compile()  from PYTHON="/usr/bin/python" CFLAGS="$CFLAGS --host=${CHOST} to PYTHON="/usr/bin/python" CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I/usr/include/libcapplet1" ./configure  --host=${CHOST}  I believe that could be called a "dirty hack" but it made the compile happen on my  box. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-21 16:13:49 UTC  ``` Hmmm.  Tried to reproduce this, but mine bombed on   /usr/lib/libGL.la: no such file or directory :)  I have xfree-4.2.0-r5 installed.  gnome-python needs work :) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Daniel Lyons    2002-02-21 16:39:51 UTC  ``` If I can talk to someone one-on-one about ebuilds and get some generic advice,  I'll take this ebuild AND start contributing the five or so I have on my own box.   But first all I want is for someone to email me and tell me what the common  mistakes are, what the accepted formatting is, etc.  What things I should do to  ensure that my build is platform-agnostic.  I'm also willing to pitch in on documentation.  Hell, I love this distro, I just want to  help!  Anyone who gives me a bit of a tutorial I will take some of the burden off of.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tod M. Neidt (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-23 22:40:12 UTC  ``` Hi!  I just tried to reproduce this bug on my other machine and gnome-python merged just fine.  This leads me to believe that there is a dependency problem with the ebuild, i.e. one that is need isn't there or doesn't specify a recent enough version. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-23 23:32:52 UTC  ``` Hi!  could you check what version of control-center you have merged?  I had 1.4.0.1-r4 and gnome-python merged fine.  I merged control-center-1.4.0.4 and remerged gnome-python and it was ok also?  There's a new version of gnome-python. I think I'll bump the version of cvs. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  chouser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-24 16:58:49 UTC  ``` I just saw this problem as well.  I fixed it by adding to the ebuild:     CFLAGS="$CFLAGS `/usr/bin/gnome-config capplet --cflags`"  I had this problem with gnome-python-1.4.1-r3 and gnome-python-1.4.2 (just a renamed copy of 1.4.1-r3, not anything that's been put in CVS recently).  The problem first showed up after I upgraded to python-2.2-r3 (from python-2.1.1-r4) and to control-center-1.4.0.4 (from, I think, control-center-1.4.0.1-r4)  Hope this helps in the bug hunt. ;-)  --Chouser ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Bruce A. Locke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-28 21:10:13 UTC  ``` gnome-python-1.4.1-r4 builds on my system...  Please reopen bug if it doesn't work for you... ``` |  |

# Tar: Denial of service — GLSA **202105-29**

A vulnerability in Tar could lead to a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/tar** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.34** |

### Background

The Tar program provides the ability to create and manipulate tar
archives.

### Description

It was discovered that GNU Tar had a memory leak when processing archive
headers.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
archive using Tar, possibly resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/tar-1.34"

```

| [Sun 17 Jan 2021 01:11:34 PM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0) Quote  An issue was discovered in GNU Tar 1.33 and earlier. There is a memory leak in read\_header() in list.c in the tar application.   Occasionally, ASAN detects an out of bounds memory read, but always reports the memory leak. Valgrind confirms the memory leak in the standard tar tool installed by default. This degrades the availability of the tar tool, and could potentially result in other memory-related issues (some fuzzed binaries stay in a loop for over 7 seconds before return).   Common Weakness Enumeration IDs for reference:  CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime  CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read   Attached to this report is a PoC malcrafted file "1311745-out-bounds.tar"   VALGRIND OUTPUT:  ...  ==3776== LEAK SUMMARY:  ==3776== definitely lost: 1,311,745 bytes in 1 blocks  ...   NOTE: Version 1.30, 1.32, 1.33 were downloaded/tested and confirmed to be vulnerable. Standard installs in Ubuntu, Kali and Fedora also were tested and have the same issue.   NOTE 2: The issue seems to be the "written" variable that holds the number of written bytes. During fuzzing, the application behaves differently under different inputs, but the memory leak / out of bounds report is the common issue seen.   I will update the ticket if I can manage to find out more.   ---  Carlos | [Carlos Andres Ramirez <carlos\_ramirez>](/users/carlos_ramirez) |
