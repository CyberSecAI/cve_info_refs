Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20838:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an improper restriction of XML external entity reference (XXE) vulnerability in the Office Server Document Converter. This vulnerability is due to the software's failure to properly handle external entities when parsing XML documents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection (CWE-611):** The software does not properly restrict XML external entity references. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious XML code that can be used to trigger a denial-of-service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact of exploiting CVE-2021-20838 is a denial-of-service (DoS). By processing a specially crafted XML document, the server running the affected software can experience resource exhaustion, leading to a service disruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through processing a specially crafted XML document. This implies that the attacker needs to provide a malicious XML file as input to the affected software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit a crafted XML document to be processed by the vulnerable Office Server Document Converter. The attack vector is network-based and does not require any user interaction.

**Additional Notes**

- The provided information also indicates that CVE-2021-20839 is a related vulnerability that can lead to massive access to other servers.
- The vendor has provided a patch that requires a full uninstall of the previous version before installing the patched version.
