    "CVE-2021-20254": {
      "root_cause": "The Samba smbd file server must map Windows group identities (SIDs) into unix group ids (gids). The code that performs this had a flaw that could allow it to read data beyond the end of the array in the case where a negative cache entry had been added to the mapping cache.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "A coding error converting SIDs to gids could allow unexpected group entries in a process token."
      ],
      "impact": "This could cause the calling code to return those values into the process token that stores the group membership for a user.\nThis could allow unauthorized access to files.",
      "attack_vectors": "While analysis of the code paths has not allowed us to discover a way for a remote user to be able to trigger this flaw reproducibly or on demand, but this CVE has been issued out of an abundance of caution.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Most commonly this flaw caused the calling code to crash, but an alert user found this flaw by noticing an unprivileged user was able to delete a file within a network share that they should have been disallowed access to."
