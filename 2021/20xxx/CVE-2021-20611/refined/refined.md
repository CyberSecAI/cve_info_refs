Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-20611:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The product does not properly validate input data, allowing for specially crafted packets to be processed incorrectly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of input data received by the affected Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC and MELIPC series products.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This could lead to the interruption of program execution or Ethernet communication.
*   Recovery requires a system reset of the affected devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.
*   The attack complexity is low, indicating that the attack is relatively easy to carry out.
*   The attacker sends specially crafted packets to the affected device via its Ethernet port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the targeted device.
*   No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability (no authentication required).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple products in the Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ-R, Q, and L series CPU modules, as well as the MELIPC series. Specific affected product versions are detailed in the provided documents.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 7.5 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H), indicating high availability impact and no confidentiality or integrity impact.
*   Mitigation involves updating the affected products to the patched firmware or operating system software versions.
*   Workarounds include using firewalls, VPNs, and the remote password or IP filter functions to restrict access from untrusted networks.

The information provided by both sources is consistent and aligns with the CVE description of an Improper Input Validation issue that leads to a denial of service.
