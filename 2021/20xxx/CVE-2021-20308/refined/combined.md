# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### **[kangwoosukeq](/kangwoosukeq)** commented [Mar 21, 2021](#issue-837074065)

| Hi, I found some integer overflow vulnerability that is similar to [CVE-2017-9181](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9181) in htmldoc.   * os : Debian GNU/Linux bullseye/sid * version : 1.9.11   [htmldoc-poc.zip](https://github.com/michaelrsweet/htmldoc/files/6177464/htmldoc-poc.zip) In htmldoc-poc, there are maliciously crafted gif and html file which crashes htmldoc like below.  ``` $ htmldoc --webpage -f out.pdf htmldoc-poc.html PAGES: 2 [1]    17884 segmentation fault  htmldoc --webpage -f out.pdf htmldoc-poc.html  ```  The vulnerability resides in image\_load\_gif() function in htmldoc/image.cxx file. In line 1279, the program reads data from given gif file using fread.  1279 fread(buf, 9, 1, fp);  Then, it stores value to 'img->width' and 'img->height' in line 1320, and 'img->depth' is determined by whether given image is grayscale.  1320 img->width = (buf[5] << 8) | buf[4]; 1321 img->height = (buf[7] << 8) | buf[6]; 1322 img->depth = gray ? 1 : 3;  If load\_data is equal to 1 and, 'img->width' and 'img->height' are enough large to cause an integer overflow, the small heap block is allocated in line 1326. It leads to buffer overrun when reads data to this buffer in gif\_read\_image().  1323 if (!load\_data) 1324 return (0); 1325 1326 img->pixels = (uchar \*)malloc((size\_t)(img->width \* img->height \* img->depth)); |

| Hmm, 65535 \* 65535 should not cause an integer overflow on modern systems, but I'll happily limit GIF files to smaller sizes. |

| This isse was assigned CVE-2021-20308  p.s.: is the CVE reference in the initial item correct? CVE-2017-9181 does not seem to be associated with htmldoc.  I noticed it may confuse.  It means the bug type of this vulnerability and [CVE-2017-9181](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jq44-j55r-694j "CVE-2017-9181") are similar.  Because they both cause integer overflow while multiplying the width and height of the input image, then lead to small heap block allocation & buffer overrun. |

| [@kangwoosukeq](https://github.com/kangwoosukeq) thanks for clarification. I indeem might just have been confused about the wording "similar to [CVE-2017-9181](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jq44-j55r-694j "CVE-2017-9181") in htmldoc". But now it's clear, you meant the class of issue/bug type. |
