## Overview

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 and 9

Red Hat understands the importance of life cycle planning for our customers, partners, ISVs, and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux ecosystem. With the introduction of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8, Red Hat simplified the RHEL product phases from four to three: Full Support, Maintenance Support, and Extended Life Phase. We are also providing information on anticipated release dates and minor releases that will offer extended support.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 and 9 delivers a ten year life cycle in Full Support and Maintenance Support Phases followed by an Extended Life Phase. In addition, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 customers may purchase annual Add-on subscriptions called Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) to extend limited subscription services beyond the Maintenance Support Phase.

#### Life Cycle[viii](#viii):

![](/sites/default/files/images/355_rhel_life_cycle_updates_0723_2.png)

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle phases are designed to reduce the level of change within each major release[i](#i) over time and make release availability and content more predictable.[ii](#ii)

## Details

During the life cycle for each major version, software changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux are delivered via individual updates known as *errata advisories* through the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/home)[iii](#iii) or other authorized Red Hat portals. Errata advisories may be released individually on an as-needed basis or aggregated as a minor release. Errata advisories will contain security fixes (Red Hat Security Advisories or RHSAs), bug fixes (Red Hat Bug Fix Advisories or RHBAs), or feature enhancements (Red Hat Enhancement Advisories or RHEAs). Errata advisories are tested and qualified against the active Red Hat Enterprise Linux major release. (For example, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 RHSA will be applied cumulatively to the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 version and patch set.) Released errata advisories remain accessible to active subscribers for the entire Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle. Within each major release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, any errata advisory (including one released as part of a minor release) will be applied cumulatively to the latest release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, including any patch sets.

During the life cycle of a major Red Hat Enterprise Linux release, Red Hat makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain binary compatibility for the core runtime environment across all minor releases and errata advisories. If necessary, Red Hat may make exceptions to this compatibility goal for Critical impact security or other significant issues. Furthermore, major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux contain a limited set of backward-compatible libraries included in previous major releases to allow for the easy migration of applications. Typically, Red Hat applies changes in such a way as to minimize the amount of change and to maintain binary compatibility. Exceptions may apply for controlled package re-bases under certain circumstances. The binary compatibility goal is extended to Red Hat Enterprise Linux for use in an application container. Additional details can be found in the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8: Application Compatibility Guide](/articles/rhel8-abi-compatibility), or the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9: Application Compatibility Guide](/articles/rhel9-abi-compatibility).

The following table details the subscription services, including support and software maintenance, performed during each phase of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle:

1. Technical Support access depends on the Service Level included in your Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscription.
2. Red Hat may choose, as a temporary measure, to address those catastrophic issues with a significant customer business impact with a Hotfix while the Bug Fix errata advisory (RHBA) is being created.
3. Native hardware enablement is provided by backporting hardware drivers, etc., to the relevant version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Hardware enablement using virtualization is achieved by running an earlier version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a virtual guest on a newer version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. See the [Virtualization](#Virtualization) description below for details. NOTE: Hardware certification (including the associated hardware limits) applies to the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that is being used as the host.
4. Intentionally left blank.
5. Software enhancements are additions of new functionality beyond correcting defects or enabling previously existing functionality on a new hardware generation.
6. Major releases are the primary vehicle for significant software enhancements, although low-impact software enhancement may also be delivered in minor releases.
7. See the [Extended Life Phase](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Phase) description below.
8. Extended Update Support (EUS), Enhanced Extended Update Support (Enhanced EUS), and Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) are available as optional add-ons. See the [EUS](#Extended_Update_Support), [Enhanced EUS,](#Enhanced_Extended_Update_Support) and [ELS](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Support) descriptions below.
9. For existing installations only. See details [below](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Phase) for other limitations.
10. See the [Issue Severity Classification](/site/security/updates/classification/) page for security severity classifications.
11. All errata provided at Red Hat's discretion.
12. Intentionally left blank.
13. Intentionally left blank.
14. Updated installation image provided at first minor release GA date.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Production Phases

### Full Support Phase[iv](#iv):

During the Full Support Phase, [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important Security errata advisories (RHSAs) and Urgent and Selected (at Red Hat discretion) High Priority Bug Fix errata advisories (RHBAs) will be released as they become available. Other errata advisories may be delivered as appropriate.

If available, new or improved hardware enablement and select enhanced software functionality may be provided at the discretion of Red Hat, generally in minor releases. Hardware enablement that does not require substantial software changes may be provided independent from minor releases at Red Hat's discretion.

Minor releases will also include available and qualified errata advisories (RHSAs, RHBAs, and RHEAs). Minor releases are cumulative and include the contents of previously released updates. The focus for minor releases during this phase lies on resolving defects of medium or higher priority.

Updated installation images will be provided for minor releases during the Full Support Phase.

### Maintenance Support Phase :

During the Maintenance Support Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 & 9 [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact Security Advisories (RHSAs) and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs) will be released as they become available. Other errata advisories may be delivered as appropriate.

New functionality and new hardware enablement are not planned for availability in the Maintenance Support Phase.

### Extended Life Phase:

During the Extended Life Phase, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription provides continued access to previously released content on the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/home), as well as other content such as documentation and the Red Hat Knowledgebase. Advice for migrating to currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions may also be provided.

For versions of products in the Extended Life Phase, Red Hat will provide limited ongoing technical support. No bug fixes, security fixes, hardware enablement or root-cause analysis will be available during this phase, and support will be provided on existing installations only.

Red Hat reserves the right to terminate the ongoing support in the Extended Life Phase for a particular version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux at any time.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 Life Cycle Red Hat is providing further predictability for Red Hat Enterprise Linux customers, partners, and ISVs. The below map provides details on when minor releases are planned, and which minor releases will include Extended Update Support and Update Services for SAP Solutions. Minor releases are planned for release every six months through the Full Support phase. RHEL 8 Planning Guide[viii](#viii) RHEL 9 Planning Guide[viii](#viii)

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux Application Streams Life Cycle

The vast majority of packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 8 & 9, including most Application Streams, will be maintained for the full 10 year Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle. Specified life cycle components, however, will be maintained for less than 10 years, with a specified life cycle often matching the upstream life of the component.

Application Streams will adhere to the errata criteria for the Production Phase of the major release. For example, errata released for an Application Stream for RHEL 8 or 9 during the Maintenance Support Phase will be confined to [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact Security Advisories (RHSAs) and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs). Similarly, no new Application Streams will be released during the Maintenance Support Phase and Extended Life Phase since Software Enhancements are not permitted during these phases. However, to achieve the 10 years support criteria for RHEL, one version of each Application Stream will be identified at the start of the Maintenance Support Phase and that version will receive maintenance as described by the support phases.

For example, most databases are supported upstream for 5 years and maintenance of their Application Stream in RHEL 8 or 9 will align with their upstream support. There will be overlapping PostgreSQL Application Streams in RHEL 8, with each stream maintained for 5 years. Customers may select the Application Stream version that best meets their needs. They can install an older version, install a newer version and stay on it for the full 5 years, or update to the latest stream with each release, whatever best fits their use case. Customers never have to update, they can update at their own convenience. If a customer asks for support beyond the specified life of an Application Stream, they may be asked to move to a newer Application Stream to take advantage of bug fixes and CVE advisories.

Please see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Application Streams Life Cycle](/support/policy/updates/rhel-app-streams-life-cycle) page for more information.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extended Maintenance

### Extended Update Support Add-on[vii](#vii)

Red Hat offers the Extended Update Support (EUS) Add-On to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription for those customers who wish to standardize on a specific minor release for an extended period of time. The EUS Add-On allows customers the flexibility to decide when to take advantage of new Red Hat Enterprise Linux features, including new hardware enablement.

Under a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, all available RHSAs and RHBAs are provided for the current active minor release until the availability of the next minor release. By contrast, EUS —for a specific minor release—an independent, extended stream of those [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact RHSAs and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority RHBAs that are available after that specific minor release and in parallel to subsequent minor releases. Please reference the [RHEL 8 and 9 EUS Support Maintenance Policy](#Extended_Update_Support_RHEL) below.

Each Red Hat Enterprise Linux EUS stream is available for 24 months from the availability of the minor release.

EUS is not offered on:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for Workstations

+ Please refer to the Application Streams life cycle section for more details

* The policy applies ONLY on current active minor releases per the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle policy
* Definition of Critical and Important Impact CVEs is defined by the [Red Hat Security Policy](/security/updates/classification)

#### Bug Fix Maintenance

* The inclusions list below is a minimum set of packages that apply to Urgent bug fixes.

+ bind, bash, chrony, grub2, grubby, glibc, gnutls, httpd, kernel, libgcrypt, libvirt, nss, openssh, openssl, python 3.6 (RHEL 8), python 3.9 (RHEL 9), qemu-kvm, rpm, sudo, systemd, wget, yum / dnf

* Urgent bugs not on the list may be addressed at Red Hat discretion.
* The policy applies ONLY on current active minor releases per the Red Hat Enterprise LInux Life Cycle Policy.

**Note:** Active minor releases refers to the period of time a specific minor release is maintained. For example, RHEL 9.0 with EUS is active for 24 months from general availability.

### Update Services for SAP Solutions Red Hat offers Update Services for SAP Solutions (E4S) on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions subscription for those customers who wish to standardize on a specific minor release for an extended period of time. The Update Services for SAP Solutions allows customers the flexibility to decide when to take advantage of new Red Hat Enterprise Linux features, including new hardware enablement. Under a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, all available RHSAs and RHBAs are provided for the current active minor release until the availability of the next minor release. By contrast, EUS and Update Services for SAP Solutions deliver—for a specific minor release—an independent, extended stream of those [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact RHSAs and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority RHBAs that are available after that specific minor release and in parallel to subsequent minor releases. For EUS and Update Services for SAP Solutions subscribers, Red Hat generally will continue to proactively provide [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact RHSAs independent of customer requests if and when available. Please reference the [RHEL 8 and 9 EUS Support Maintenance Policy](#Extended_Update_Support_RHEL) above. Each Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update Services for SAP Solutions stream is available for 48 months from the availability of the minor release. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions on RHEL 8, Update Services for SAP Solutions is currently available for the following releases: * 8.1 (ended November 30, 2023) * 8.2 (ended April 30, 2024) * 8.4 (ends May 31, 2025) * 8.6 (ends May 31, 2026) * 8.8 (ends May 31, 2027, *Last EUS release*) **Note:** RHEL 8.10 is the final RHEL 8 release, and maintenance is defined by the ( [Maintenance Support Phase](#Maintenance_Support_2_Phase)) policy above. For more information on configuring SAP Solutions on RHEL 8.10, please follow this [LINK](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_sap_solutions/8/html-single/rhel_for_sap_subscriptions_and_repositories/index#con_hana_10rhel-for-sap-subscriptions-and-repositories-8). For Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions on RHEL 9, Update Services for SAP Solutions is currently available for the following releases: * 9.0 (ends May 31, 2026) * 9.2 (ends May 31, 2027) * 9.4 (ends April 30, 2028) In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, Update Services for SAP Solutions is also planned for RHEL 9.6 and 9.8 ([see above chart](#RHEL9_Planning_Guide)).

### Extended Life-cycle Support Add-On:

### RHEL 6 Extended Life-cycle Support Add-On:

Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) is an optional Add-On subscription for certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions. The ELS Add-on is available during the Extended Life Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 ELS delivers certain Red Hat defined Critical and Important security fixes and selected (at Red Hat discretion) urgent priority bug fixes and troubleshooting for the [last minor release](#Life_Cycle_Dates).

* [**RHEL 6 ELS Inclusion List**](/articles/4997301).

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the ELS Add-On covers the IBM z Systems and the x86 architecture, both 32-bit and 64-bit variants. Add-Ons are not covered by ELS.

For guidance on how to best modernize your Red Hat infrastructure with a solution that meets your business needs, contact Red Hat Consulting.

**Note:** Only Standard or Premium subscriptions to RHEL Server are eligible for ELS Support. RHEL Desktop or RHEL Workstation subscriptions are not eligible for ELS.

### RHEL 7 Extended Life-cycle Support Add-On:

Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) is an optional Add-On subscription for certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions. The ELS Add-on is available during the Extended Life Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ELS delivers certain Red Hat defined Critical and Important security fixes and selected (at Red Hat discretion) urgent priority bug fixes and troubleshooting for the [last minor release](#Life_Cycle_Dates).

* [**Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support Maintenance Policy.**](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhel7-els-support-maintenance-policy).

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the ELS Add-On covers the IBM z Systems and the x86 architecture (64-bit only). Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support also includes maintenance for Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions, Red Hat Enterprise Linux High Availability add-on, and the Resilient Storage add-on.

Only Standard or Premium subscriptions to RHEL Server are eligible for ELS Support. RHEL Desktop or RHEL Workstation subscriptions are not eligible for ELS.

**Note:** RHEL ELS should be purchased before the start date of the ELS period (June 30, 2024 for RHEL 7 ELS). Otherwise, the ELS Add-on subscription must be back-dated to the RHEL ELS period start date

## Virtualization

Virtualization provides hardware abstraction for guest operating systems. Abstraction allows a guest that is running an older version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that does not support the latest server hardware to be easily deployed on a virtualization host that does. In this way, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 guest can be hosted by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 on a latest-generation processor.

Red Hat intends to support those versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that are still within the Production or Extended Life Phase when run as virtualized guests on later versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The [Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualization support matrix](http://www.redhat.com/resourcelibrary/articles/enterprise-linux-virtualization-support) provides details on the supported combinations of operating systems, versions, and hardware architectures.

## Life-cycle Dates

All future dates mentioned for "End of Full Support" and "End of Maintenance Support 1" are close approximations, non definitive, and subject to change.

### **[hifoolno](/hifoolno)** commented [Feb 2, 2021](#issue-798961516)

| When `image->ticks_per_second` was set to zero, a division by zero error would happen in line 961. So a crafted file may trigger undefined behavior in the form of division by zero. Maybe there need a `PerceptibleReciprocal()` to do division in line 961?     [ImageMagick/coders/webp.c](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/74f8868c779a5bde13f594ae12955d5d281ef890/coders/webp.c#L936-L967)  Lines 936 to 967 in [74f8868](/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/74f8868c779a5bde13f594ae12955d5d281ef890)   |  | while (image != NULL) | | --- | --- | |  | { | |  | status=(MagickBooleanType) WebPPictureInit(&picture); | |  | if (status == MagickFalse) | |  | { | |  | (void) ThrowMagickException(exception,GetMagickModule(), | |  | ResourceLimitError,"UnableToEncodeImageFile","`%s'",image->filename); | |  | break; | |  | } | |  |  | |  | status=WriteSingleWEBPPicture(image\_info,image,configure,&picture, | |  | exception); | |  | if (status == MagickFalse) | |  | break; | |  |  | |  | status=(MagickBooleanType) WebPAnimEncoderAdd(enc,&picture, | |  | (int) frame\_timestamp,configure); | |  | WebPPictureFree(&picture); | |  | if (status == MagickFalse) | |  | { | |  | (void) ThrowMagickException(exception,GetMagickModule(), | |  | CoderError,WebPAnimEncoderGetError(enc),"`%s'",image->filename); | |  | break; | |  | } | |  |  | |  | effective\_delta=image->delay\*1000/image->ticks\_per\_second; | |  | if (effective\_delta < 10) | |  | effective\_delta=100; /\* Consistent with gif2webp \*/ | |  | frame\_timestamp+=effective\_delta; | |  |  | |  | image=GetNextImageInList(image); | |  | } | |

Package        : imagemagick
Version        : 8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u13
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-27751 CVE-2021-20243 CVE-2021-20245 CVE-2021-20309
                 CVE-2021-20312 CVE-2021-20313

Multiple security issues have been discovered in imagemagick.

CVE-2020-27751

    A flaw was found in MagickCore/quantum-export.c. An attacker who submits a
    crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior
    in the form of values outside the range of type
    `unsigned long long` as well as a shift exponent that is too large for
    64-bit type. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,
    but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.

CVE-2021-20243

    A flaw was found in MagickCore/resize.c. An attacker who submits a crafted
    file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior
    in the form of math division by zero.

CVE-2021-20245

    A flaw was found in coders/webp.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that
    is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of
    math division by zero.

CVE-2021-20309

    A division by zero in WaveImage() of MagickCore/visual-effects.c may trigger
    undefined behavior via a crafted image file submitted to an application using
    ImageMagick.

CVE-2021-20312

    An integer overflow in WriteTHUMBNAILImage of coders/thumbnail.c may trigger
    undefined behavior via a crafted image file that is submitted by an attacker
    and processed by an application using ImageMagick.

CVE-2021-20313

    A potential cipher leak when the calculate signatures in TransformSignature is possible.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u13.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1928943#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-02-15 20:30:52 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in ImageMagick in coders/webp.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.10-62.  Upstream issue:  <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/3176>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1928943#c1)  RaTasha Tillery-Smith    2021-02-16 14:42:04 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/3176>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1928943#c2)  Todd Cullum    2021-02-17 20:34:26 UTC  ``` Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-8 [[bug 1929889](show_bug.cgi?id=1929889 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-20245 ImageMagick: Division by zero in WriteAnimatedWEBPImage() in coders/webp.c [epel-8]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1929890](show_bug.cgi?id=1929890 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-20245 ImageMagick: Division by zero in WriteAnimatedWEBPImage() in coders/webp.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1928943#c3)  Todd Cullum    2021-02-17 20:40:13 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  When image->ticks_per_second is set to 0 in WriteAnimatedWEBPImage() of ImageMagick/coders/webp.c, a division by zero could occur, causing an impact to application availability if an attacker is able to submit a crafted input image file to be processed by ImageMagick. This is because  image->ticks_per_second is acquired from the image file. The patch addresses the issue by using the PerceptibleReciprocal() function instead of division.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1928943#c4)  Todd Cullum    2021-02-17 20:40:24 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick6/commit/a78d92dc0f468e79c3d761aae9707042952cdaca>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1928943#c5)  Todd Cullum    2021-02-17 20:41:28 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. To learn more about Red Hat Enterprise Linux support scope, please see <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/> .   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1928943#c6)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-02-18 19:02:59 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
