Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-20245:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a division-by-zero error in the `WriteAnimatedWEBPImage()` function located in the `coders/webp.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, the division occurs when the `image->ticks_per_second` value is zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Division by Zero:** The core weakness is the lack of input validation for `image->ticks_per_second` before performing a division operation, allowing a zero value to cause a crash. This is a classic example of CWE-369: Divide by Zero

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of successful exploitation is a denial of service. When a crafted image file with a `ticks_per_second` value of zero is processed, it triggers the division by zero, causing the application to crash.
- **Undefined Behavior:** The vulnerability leads to undefined behavior due to the division by zero, which may potentially have other, unspecified negative consequences beyond just a crash depending on compiler and system configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Image File:** The attack vector involves an attacker providing a maliciously crafted image file (specifically, a WebP image file) to an application that uses ImageMagick. The crafted file must set the `ticks_per_second` field to zero.
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to process the provided image using ImageMagick's WebP encoder, specifically through the vulnerable function `WriteAnimatedWEBPImage()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Submission:** The attacker must be able to submit the crafted image file to an application using ImageMagick.
- **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges, as it relies on exploiting a processing flaw in the application.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing the direct division with the `PerceptibleReciprocal()` function, which likely handles the case where the divisor is zero in a safe way.
- The issue was addressed in both the ImageMagick 6 and ImageMagick 7 branches.
- Red Hat has marked this issue as "out of scope" for RHEL 6 and 7, implying it will not be backported to those versions.
