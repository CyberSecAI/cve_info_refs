# Stack overflow on server running PUB/XPUB socket (CURVE disabled)

Moderate

[bluca](/bluca)
published
GHSA-qq65-x72m-9wr8
Sep 7, 2020

## Package

libzmq

## Affected versions

<= 4.3.2

## Patched versions

4.3.3

## Description

### Impact

Users with listening TCP PUB/XPUB endpoints who do NOT use CURVE/ZAP for authentication

### Patches

[#3959](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3959)

### Workarounds

None

### References

Found thanks to Google's oss-fuzz project:

<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=22488>

### For more information

The PUB/XPUB subscription store (mtrie) is traversed using recursive function calls. In the remove (unsubscription) case, the recursive calls are NOT tail calls, so even with optimizations the stack grows linearly with the length of a subscription topic.

Topics are under the control of remote clients - they can send a subscription to arbitrary length topics. An attacker can thus cause a server to create an mtrie sufficiently large such that, when unsubscribing, traversal will cause a stack overflow.

Stack overflows are obviously more dangerous than normal OOM situations, and if built right can lead to other exploits.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

No known CVE

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

| Looks good, by the way, it seems the add was tail recursive, was it a problem as well?  It is in case the compiler doesn't optimize it away, so we can't be 100% sure on our end, so I changed it too |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1921976#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-01-29 00:28:37 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in zeromq before version 4.3.3. The PUB/XPUB subscription store (mtrie) is traversed using recursive function calls. In the remove (unsubscription) case, the recursive calls are NOT tail calls, so even with optimizations the stack grows linearly with the length of a subscription topic. Topics are under the control of remote clients - they can send a subscription to arbitrary length topics. An attacker can thus cause a server to create an mtrie sufficiently large such that, when unsubscribing, traversal will cause a stack overflow.
