Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20236:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way libzmq handles subscriptions in PUB/XPUB sockets. The subscription store (mtrie) is traversed using recursive function calls. The removal (unsubscription) process uses non-tail recursive calls, which cause the stack to grow linearly with the length of the subscription topic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Non-Tail Recursion:**  The use of non-tail recursive calls during unsubscription leads to stack growth proportional to the topic length.
- **Uncontrolled Topic Length:** Remote clients can control the length of subscription topics, allowing an attacker to create arbitrarily large topics.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stack Overflow:** An attacker can cause a stack overflow by creating a sufficiently large mtrie through long subscription topics, and then unsubscribing.
- **Potential for Further Exploits:** Stack overflows are more dangerous than normal OOM situations and could potentially be leveraged for further exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Clients:**  The attack is performed by remote clients sending crafted subscription and unsubscription requests.
- **PUB/XPUB Sockets:** The vulnerability specifically affects servers running PUB/XPUB sockets that do not use CURVE/ZAP for authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send messages to the vulnerable server.
- **Ability to Send Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send subscription and unsubscription messages to the PUB/XPUB socket.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through Google's oss-fuzz project.
- The fix involved converting the `add` and `rm` functions to iterative algorithms to prevent stack growth.
- The vulnerability is present in libzmq versions <= 4.3.2 and is fixed in 4.3.3.
- The issue is explicitly stated to only affect cases where CURVE/ZAP is not in use for authentication
