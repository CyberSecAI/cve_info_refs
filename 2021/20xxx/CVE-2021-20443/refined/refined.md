- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing check for Subresource Integrity (SRI) support in Maximo Data Loader (maxloader).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of SRI verification for scripts from third-party services.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If a third-party service is compromised, user is not protected, potentially leading to malicious script execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Compromise of third-party service hosting scripts used by Maximo Data Loader.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to compromise a third-party service that provides scripts to Maximo Data Loader.
