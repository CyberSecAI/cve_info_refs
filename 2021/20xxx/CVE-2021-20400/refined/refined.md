- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM QRadar SIEM product uses cryptographic algorithms that are weaker than expected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation could lead to compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data protected by these weak algorithms, although the specific impact is not detailed in this advisory.
- **Attack vectors**: The advisory does not specify attack vectors but implies that an attacker could potentially exploit the weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The advisory does not explicitly state the attacker's required capabilities or position.
