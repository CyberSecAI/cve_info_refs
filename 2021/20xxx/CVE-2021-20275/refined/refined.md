{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An invalid read occurs within the `chunked_body_is_complete()` function when handling chunked encoded HTTP responses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Invalid read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to a crash caused by the invalid read.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted HTTP request with a chunk-encoded response can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a malicious request to a Privoxy server, which could be done remotely. No special capabilities are needed other than sending HTTP requests.",
     "additional_notes": "The issue arises from improper handling of chunked data, where Privoxy may misdetect the end of a chunked response if it's not received in one read or if actual data is mistaken as the last chunk. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.0.32 of Privoxy."
