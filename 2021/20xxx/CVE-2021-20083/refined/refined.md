Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `jquery-query-object` plugin. Specifically, the `parseNew` function, during the processing of query parameters, does not properly sanitize or validate the keys before using them. This function uses `decodeURIComponent` on the key, which can allow the key to be `__proto__`, and it uses `SET` function which can modify the prototype of `Object`, or any other object, if the attacker controls the key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is prototype pollution. By crafting a malicious query string with keys like `__proto__[test]` or `constructor[prototype][test]`, an attacker can inject properties into the prototype of `Object`. This can have significant consequences depending on the application's usage of objects and their properties.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability is a result of insufficient input validation and sanitization within the `parseNew` function. The plugin attempts to process query parameters directly without filtering out dangerous keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Instability/Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object` prototype, an attacker could potentially introduce unexpected behavior in the application, leading to instability or even denial of service if the polluted properties are accessed during application runtime.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While not directly XSS, prototype pollution can be a powerful primitive to achieve XSS. If the application accesses polluted prototype properties in a vulnerable context, this could lead to XSS.
*   **Data Tampering:** Depending on the application, this may lead to data tampering if the polluted properties affect data processing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Query String:** The primary attack vector is through the URL query string. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with specially crafted query parameters that exploit the `jquery-query-object` plugin. For example `?__proto__[test]=test` or `?constructor[prototype][test]=test`.
*   **URL Hash:** The vulnerability is also present in the hash part of the URL, the attack is similar to the one performed using the query string, but the attacker uses the URL hash to execute the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to get the user to load a page using a crafted URL or be able to manipulate the URL using javascript and/or an XSS vulnerability. This means no special privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes references to updates for Fedora 35 and 36 that address this vulnerability by upgrading the `wordpress` package, which uses the vulnerable jQuery plugin.
*   The code snippet from the `jquery-query-object.js` file clearly shows the vulnerable parsing and `SET` logic.
*   The PoC section provides examples of how to exploit this vulnerability through URL parameters, including `?__proto__[test]=test` which injects the property `test` into the prototype.
*   The `SET` function does not perform any checks on keys before assigning a value using `this.keys[base] = set(target, tokens.slice(0), value);`

In summary, CVE-2021-20083 is a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `jquery-query-object` plugin, triggered by processing specially crafted URL query parameters. This can lead to application instability, XSS, or data tampering.
