- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack overflow in the `chkhltst` program due to the `TIS_CODESET` environment variable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The stack overflow vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by setting a maliciously crafted `TIS_CODESET` environment variable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the `TIS_CODESET` environment variable when the `chkhltst` program is executed.
