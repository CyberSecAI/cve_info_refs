- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MagazinegerZ CGI script contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An arbitrary script may be executed on the web browser of a user with administrative privileges while accessing the website that uses MagazinegerZ. This could lead to malicious actions performed in the context of the administrator's session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when an administrative user logs into the management screen. The stored XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious script code that is later executed in the admin's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to inject malicious script into a field that will be displayed on the admin panel, such as a newsletter post.
