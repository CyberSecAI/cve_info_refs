💵 **Rates**: set of currencies aggregators for automatic rates changing. Also admin can set rates manually if it’s necessary!

🔄 **Rates auto update**: update currency rates hourly, twice daily, daily, weekly, monthly by cron. Or you can disable it and set your own currency rates by hands!

💰 **Price**: set price format which fit your needs – decimals count, usual money sign or custom sign, money sign position (4 variants). You can show or hide cents for each currency optionally.

🔢 **Custom price formats**: each currency can has its own format where price and money sign can be set on the side you want

📹 **Video to understand basics**:

Note: for today design of the plugin is different of the video (is improved), see screenshots below!

🎁 **Welcome currency**: allows to set any price currency you want for your site visitors first visit. So if your site currency is INR and you want let your customers on their first visit see prices converted to USD you just need to set ‘Welcome currency’ in WPCS options.

I’m just using the free version where only 2 currencies are allowed but that’s enough for me. At first I was confused on how to get it to work but then I saw the video (the video seems like its using an old version but most of the features are still there) in the info tab and it’s perfect! Thank you!
