Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20315:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in gnome-shell when the "Application menu" or "Window list" GNOME extensions are enabled. This flaw was introduced while backporting a feature related to persistently showing the security level of a machine at login time.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Locking protection bypass: The system's lock screen fails to properly restrict user interaction.
- Unauthorized access to application management: The vulnerability allows interaction with the application menu and window list even when the system is locked.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized application control: A physical attacker can kill existing applications and start new ones as the locked user.
- Complete bypass of screen lock: The system's locked state does not prevent user interaction with applications, essentially making the lock screen ineffective.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access: An attacker must have physical access to the locked machine to exploit this vulnerability.
- Enabled GNOME extensions: The "Application menu" or "Window list" GNOME extensions must be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical presence: The attacker must be physically present at the machine while it is in a locked state.
- User context: The attacker gains control of applications within the context of the locked user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was present in CentOS Stream 8, specifically in gnome-shell-3.32.2-39.el8.x86_64.
- No released RHEL version was affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was fixed in gnome-shell 3.32.2-40.el8.
