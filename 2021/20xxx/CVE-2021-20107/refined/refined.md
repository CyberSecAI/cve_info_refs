{
  "CVE-2021-20107": {
    "root_cause": "An unauthenticated BLE interface is present in Sloan SmartFaucets and Flushometers, allowing for communication without authentication.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unauthenticated BLE Interface",
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Kinetic Effects"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read and write to BLE characteristics, controlling water flow, sensor sensitivity and access maintenance information. This can lead to unauthorized kinetic effects (e.g., activating the faucet) and information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity is used to interact with the vulnerable devices. Tools like Android/iOS applications (e.g., NRF Connect) and Linux command-line tools (e.g., gatttool) can be used to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the device and have tools capable of interacting with BLE characteristics. No prior authentication is needed."
