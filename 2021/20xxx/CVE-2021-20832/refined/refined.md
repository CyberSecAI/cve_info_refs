Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The InBody App has an information disclosure vulnerability related to how it interacts with the InBody Dial body composition analyzer. Specifically, the app can receive measurement data from the device under specific, unspecified conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure (CWE-200):** The core issue is that the app can improperly expose sensitive measurement data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker who can connect to an InBody Dial using the vulnerable app may be able to obtain a victim's measurement results (weight, BMI, muscle mass, fat mass).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Adjacent Network (Bluetooth):** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the InBody Dial and able to connect via the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within the Bluetooth range of the victim's InBody Dial device.
*   **Application Access:** The attacker needs to have the vulnerable InBody App installed and be able to connect it to the target InBody Dial.
*   **User Interaction:** The CVSS v3 score indicates user interaction is required (UI:R), but the exact nature of this interaction is not specified. It likely requires the attacker to have the vulnerable application connect to the target's InBody Dial device, which would likely require some user actions or consent.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability only exists when the InBody App works in conjunction with the InBody Dial device.
*   The specific conditions to exploit the vulnerability are not detailed in this document.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in InBody App for iOS versions 2.3.30 or later and for Android versions 2.2.90(510) or later.
*   The CVSS scores provided (both v3 and v2) indicate that the impact is primarily related to confidentiality, with no integrity or availability impact. The attack vector is adjacent network and the attack complexity is low for CVSS v3.
