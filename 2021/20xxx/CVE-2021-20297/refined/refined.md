{
  "CVE-2021-20297": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in NetworkManager. Setting match.path and activating a profile crashes NetworkManager.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a crash triggered when a NetworkManager profile with the 'match.path' setting is activated, because `nm_wildcard_match_check` does not handle NULL input properly.  Specifically, the function uses __fnmatch, which dereferences a null string.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of NULL pointers",
       "Incorrect string handling in the `nm_wildcard_match_check` function."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the NetworkManager service.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating or modifying a NetworkManager profile with a match.path setting and then triggering the activation of that profile.",
    "Required capabilities": "Local or authenticated access to modify/create NetworkManager profiles and activate the vulnerable profile."
  }
}
