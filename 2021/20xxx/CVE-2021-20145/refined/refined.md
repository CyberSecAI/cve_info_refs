{
  "cveId": "CVE-2021-20145",
  "description": "Gryphon Tower routers contain an unprotected openvpn configuration file which can grant attackers access to the Gryphon homebound VPN network which exposes the LAN interfaces of other users' devices connected to the same service. An attacker could leverage this to make configuration changes to, or otherwise attack victims' devices as though they were on an adjacent network.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "An unprotected OpenVPN configuration file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Storage of Credentials",
      "Exposure of Sensitive Information"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain access to the Gryphon homebound VPN network, exposing the LAN interfaces of other users' devices, potentially enabling attacks against these devices as if on an adjacent network. This could allow for configuration changes or other malicious activities.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network access to the vulnerable router and extraction of the OpenVPN configuration file"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Ability to connect to the Gryphon router and extract the unprotected OpenVPN configuration file."
