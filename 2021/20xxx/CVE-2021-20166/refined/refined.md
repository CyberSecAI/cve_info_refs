    "source": "www.tenable.com_439b1a78_20250115_194437.html",
    "root_cause": "Buffer overflow in the URL parsing functionality within the cgi-bin endpoint.",
    "vulnerability": "The router's cgi-bin URL parsing functionality contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the query string parameter, intended to be a static 256-character array, can be overflowed. This overflow allows the setting of the PATH_INFO variable which is usually NULL.  By manipulating the PATH_INFO variable, an attacker can control which cgi binary is executed without proper authentication.",
     "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect the application's control flow.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted POST request to the cgi-bin endpoint.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network (adjacent) as the router to exploit the vulnerability."

        "vulnerability": "Default HTTP communication exposes potentially sensitive information due to the lack of secure communication to the web interface.",
        "impact": "Sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, is transmitted in cleartext due to the use of HTTP instead of HTTPS.",
        "attack_vector": "Network traffic between the user and the router.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with network access to the router can eavesdrop on the communication to intercept sensitive information."

        "vulnerability": "Insufficient protections on the UART interface. A malicious actor with physical access to the device can connect to the UART port via serial connection, log in with default credentials (admin:admin), and execute commands as the root user.",
        "impact": "An attacker with physical access can gain full control of the device.",

        "root_cause": "Combination of a buffer overflow in URL parsing and command injection in readycloud_control.cgi",
        "vulnerability": "A buffer overflow in the cgi-bin URL parsing can bypass authentication. This, combined with a command injection vulnerability in readycloud_control.cgi, allows unauthenticated command injection. Specifically, the 'name' parameter within the '/api/users' endpoint is passed unsanitized into a system() call, leading to command injection as root.",
        "impact": "Unauthenticated remote command injection as root.",
         "attack_vector": "By sending a POST request to the cgi-bin endpoint with an overflowed query string and malicious payload to /api/users endpoint.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must have network access to the device. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely if the router has remote management enabled via WAN."
