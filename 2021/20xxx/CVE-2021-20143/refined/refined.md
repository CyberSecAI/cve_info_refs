{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2021-20143",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `controller_server` service on Gryphon Tower routers does not sanitize user input passed to strings which are then executed via `system()` calls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker on the same network can execute commands as root on the device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted malicious packet to the `controller_server` service on port 9999."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device.",
    "technical_details": "The vulnerability is located within the parameters of operation 48 in the controller_server service. The command `system()` is used to execute unsanitized input passed through the parameter `newclient`. The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to create the file `/tmp/op48` containing the results of the `id` command.",
    "affected_products": "Gryphon Tower routers"
  },
  "official_description": "An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in the parameters of operation 48 in the controller_server service on Gryphon Tower routers. An unauthenticated remote attacker on the same network can execute commands as root on the device by sending a specially crafted malicious packet to the controller_server service on port 9999."
