Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-20623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from unencrypted communication on non-well-known ports within the Panasonic Video Insight VMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission:** The use of unencrypted communication channels is the core weakness. This allows an attacker to potentially intercept and manipulate data transmitted between the VMS server and its clients.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The lack of encryption leads to an arbitrary code execution vulnerability, which implies that a specifically crafted request can be sent to the system and cause the system to execute code.
- **CWE-94:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code), indicating that the system doesn't properly validate or sanitize data that it processes as code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system with system user privileges. This can lead to full system compromise, data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The exploitation can result in a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, modify system configurations, and disrupt normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning that the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
- **Specially Crafted Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the VMS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Video Insight VMS instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerability and the structure of the crafted request to exploit it.
- **No Authentication Required**: The CVSS score indicates that no privileges are required to perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Joachim Kerschbaumer (@joachimk).
- The issue was addressed in Video Insight IP Server 7.8.
- This vulnerability affects Video Insight VMS versions prior to 7.8.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
