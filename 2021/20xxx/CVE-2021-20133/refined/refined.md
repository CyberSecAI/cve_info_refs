  "CVE-2021-20133": {
    "Root cause": "Absolute path traversal vulnerability in Quagga Services on D-Link DIR-2640 routers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Absolute path traversal",
       "Improper handling of filenames"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can read parts or all of arbitrary text files on the filesystem by setting the 'message of the day' banner to a file path, leading to information disclosure. They can also cause a denial of service to the Quagga CLI by setting the banner to a special device like /dev/urandom.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker interacts with the Quagga service's configuration terminal interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A remote, authenticated attacker with high privileges is needed to exploit this vulnerability."
