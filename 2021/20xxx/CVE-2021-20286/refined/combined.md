### opt\_go: Tolerate unplanned server death

```

While debugging some experimental nbdkit code that was triggering an
assertion failure in nbdkit, I noticed a secondary failure of nbdsh
also dying from an assertion:

libnbd: debug: nbdsh: nbd_opt_go: transition: NEWSTYLE.OPT_GO.SEND -> DEAD
libnbd: debug: nbdsh: nbd_opt_go: option queued, ignoring state machine failure
nbdsh: opt.c:86: nbd_unlocked_opt_go: Assertion `nbd_internal_is_state_negotiating (get_next_state (h))' failed.

Although my trigger was from non-production nbdkit code, libnbd should
never die from an assertion failure merely because a server
disappeared at the wrong moment during an incomplete reply to
NBD_OPT_GO or NBD_OPT_INFO.  If this is assigned a CVE, a followup
patch will add mention of it in docs/libnbd-security.pod.

Fixes: [bbf1c513](/nbdkit/libnbd/-/commit/bbf1c5139248a3ef9e018271d0cfa84522c6d559 "api: Give aio_opt_go a completion callback") (api: Give aio_opt_go a completion callback)
```
