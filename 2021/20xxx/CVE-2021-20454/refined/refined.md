- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity (XXE) Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The presence of an XXE injection vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information or execute arbitrary code by manipulating XML input.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to sensitive information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves manipulating XML input processed by the vulnerable WebSphere Application Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to provide or influence XML input processed by the vulnerable server.
