- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RFNTPS terrestrial reception type NTP server contains an OS command injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user on the same LAN who can access the product may execute an arbitrary OS command with root privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent network. An attacker on the same LAN can send crafted requests to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the vulnerable device and have the ability to send network requests to it. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
