### @peterhillman **[peterhillman](/peterhillman)** commented [Sep 25, 2020](#issue-708561062)

B44 was allocating a \_tmpBuffer of `maxScanLineSize`\*`numScanlines` `unsigned short` values. `maxScanLineSize` is the number of bytes of uncompressed data on each scanline, not the number of pixel samples. \_tmpBuffer was therefore assigning one 16 bit short for every byte of uncompressed data, so making the buffer twice the size it needs to be

partially addresses out-of-memory issue <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=25913>

Debian Bug     : 986796 992703 990450 990899 1014828

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in OpenEXR, command-line
tools and a library for the OpenEXR image format. Buffer overflows or
out-of-bound reads could lead to a denial of service (application crash) if
a malformed image file is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.1-4.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
