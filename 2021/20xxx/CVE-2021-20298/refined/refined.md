Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20298:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds memory allocation issue in the `B44Compressor` of OpenEXR. Specifically, the code was allocating twice the necessary memory for a temporary buffer (`_tmpBuffer`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Memory Allocation:** The `_tmpBuffer` was allocated with twice the required size, which could lead to excessive memory usage.
- **Out-of-memory error:**  This excessive allocation can exhaust the available memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the application to exhaust all available memory, leading to a crash or making the system unresponsive.
- **System Availability:** The primary impact is the loss of availability of the system processing the malicious image file.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted Image File:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted image file. This file would need to be processed by an application using the vulnerable OpenEXR library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit a crafted image file to an application using the vulnerable OpenEXR library for processing.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `OpenEXR/IlmImf/ImfB44Compressor.cpp` file.
- The fix involved reducing the size of the allocated `_tmpBuffer` to the necessary size by correctly calculating the size as  `maxScanLineSize / sizeof(unsigned short) * numScanLines` instead of `maxScanLineSize * numScanLines`
- The issue was identified through fuzzing.
- The vulnerability is fixed in OpenEXR version 3.0.0-beta
