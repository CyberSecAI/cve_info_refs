- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper processing of RSS registration leads to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts on the web browser where the vulnerable RSS reader is running. This is achieved by loading a malicious RSS feed into the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is network based, involving the loading of a malicious RSS feed by the user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious RSS feed and have the user load this feed into the vulnerable RSS reader. No special privileges are needed. User interaction is required for the attack to succeed.
