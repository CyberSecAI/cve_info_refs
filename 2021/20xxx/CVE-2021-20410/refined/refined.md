- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The InfluxDB user and password credentials were included in the logs stack YAML file of IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (InfluxDB credentials) within the ISIQ configuration files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the InfluxDB instance, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service for the logging and monitoring system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could gain access to the YAML configuration file, either through unauthorized access to the system or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to read or download the file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the YAML configuration file containing the InfluxDB credentials. This could be through local access, compromised credentials, or a vulnerability allowing file access.
