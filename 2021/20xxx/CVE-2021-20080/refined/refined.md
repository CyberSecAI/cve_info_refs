Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20080:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of output within the XML processing logic of asset discovery in ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus and AssetExplorer. Specifically, the IP address extracted from the `/sbin/ifconfig` command output in the discovered asset's XML data is unsafely used to construct a JavaScript function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript can be injected via a crafted XML asset file. When an administrator views this asset, the injected JavaScript executes.
- **Improper input validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the IP address extracted from the output of the `/sbin/ifconfig` command. It assumes that a space character will follow the IP address and does not validate the format of this data.
- **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerable endpoint `/discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet` does not require authentication to submit the crafted XML asset data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the administrator's browser session.
- **Authenticated actions:** An attacker can perform authenticated actions on behalf of the administrator, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Remote unauthenticated attacker:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to `/discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet` with a malicious XML document. The crafted XML document contains malicious JavaScript within the output of the `/sbin/ifconfig` command.
- **Exploitation of the vulnerability:** When an administrator views the created asset, the malicious JavaScript executes due to the unsafe construction of the `clickToExpandIP()` function.
- **Search result manipulation:** The attacker could send a benign link to the administrator (e.g., a search result for the created asset) to increase the likelihood of exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to have valid credentials on the application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet` and the structure of the required XML payload.
- **Target user action:** The administrator needs to view the created asset for the malicious JavaScript to be executed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited on systems that provide the output of the "/sbin/ifconfig" command, including Unix-like systems.
- The vulnerability exists in both ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus and AssetExplorer.
- The proof of concept shows that the injected JavaScript will be executed and an alert will appear. More complex JS code can be injected to achieve other goals, such as data exfiltration.
- The vulnerability is fixed in ServiceDesk Plus version 11200 and AssetExplorer version 6800.
