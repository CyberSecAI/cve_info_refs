Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is described as an "Operational restrictions bypass vulnerability in Workflow". This indicates a flaw in how the software enforces access controls or permissions within the workflow module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization/Access Control Issues (CWE-264):** The core issue is a failure to properly enforce restrictions on workflow operations. This can stem from inadequate permission checks or logic errors in how the software determines whether a user is authorized to perform a given action within the workflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to alter workflow data without the appropriate privileges. This could potentially lead to:
    *   Unauthorized modifications of records
    *   Circumvention of approval processes
    *   Tampering with sensitive business information

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have an account with basic login privileges to the application in order to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The exploitation doesn't require any user interaction.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Cybozu Office versions 10.0.0 to 10.8.4 are affected.
*   **CVSS v3:** The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 4.3, which is considered medium severity. The breakdown of the metric is:
    *   AV:N (Network)
    *   AC:L (Low)
    *   PR:L (Low)
    *   UI:N (None)
    *   S:U (Unchanged)
    *   C:N (None)
    *   I:L (Low)
    *   A:N (None)

*   **CVSS v2:** The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v2 base score of 4.0. The breakdown of the metric is:
    *   AV:N (Network)
    *  AC:L (Low)
    *  Au:S (Authentication required)
    *  C:N (None)
    *  I:P (Partial)
    *  A:N (None)
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed in Cybozu Office version 10.8.5.

In summary, CVE-2021-20626 is a medium-severity vulnerability where an attacker with low-level access can bypass workflow restrictions to alter data.
