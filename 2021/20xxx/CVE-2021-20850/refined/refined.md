Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-20850

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an OS command injection flaw within the XMLRPC API of PowerCMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):**  The application fails to properly sanitize or validate input passed to the XMLRPC API, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the server hosting PowerCMS. This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, such as data theft, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
* **XMLRPC API:** The attack is performed through the vulnerable XMLRPC API of PowerCMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the PowerCMS server via the network.
* **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication.

**Affected Versions:**
* PowerCMS 5.19 and earlier (PowerCMS 5 Series)
* PowerCMS 4.49 and earlier (PowerCMS 4 Series)
* PowerCMS 3.295 and earlier (PowerCMS 3 Series)
* Potentially PowerCMS 2 series and earlier (though unsupported).

**Mitigation:**

* **Disable XMLRPC API** If the XMLRPC API is not in use, disable it by:
    *   Deleting or removing execute permissions from `mt-xmlrpc.cgi` if using CGI/FCGI
    *   Setting `RestrictedPSGIApp xmlrpc` in the configuration if using PSGI.
* **Apply Patches:** Apply the latest patches provided by the vendor.
* **Restrict Access:** If disabling or patching is not immediately feasible, restrict access to the vulnerable `mt-xmlrpc.cgi` file by only allowing access from trusted sources or enabling HTTP authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The initial patch released on October 22, 2021 was found to be insufficient, and a revised patch was subsequently issued.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Alfasado Inc. to JPCERT/CC.
*   CVSS v3 score of 9.8 (Critical) and CVSS v2 score of 7.5 (High) are assigned to this vulnerability.
