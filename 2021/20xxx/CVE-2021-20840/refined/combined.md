### [Few Currency Supported](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/few-currency-supported/)

This is probably a good booking plugin but I can’t use it because it doesn’t support my currency. The developer listed all the countries in the world but a few currencies. Why would I, a Nigerian, quote a service to my Nigerian clients in any other currency but Naira? Makes no sense. And it’s an easy update to list all the currencies in the world.

外部サイトへ移管させる予約システムは論外として、自己サイト内に埋め込める予約システム（WordPressプラグイン）の中では国内でこれ以外に選択肢は無いと思われる。素人にはとっつきにくいかもしれないが自由度の高さが半端ない。

Despite spending half my day trying to make this plugin work, I have given up. Their is no documentation to guide you. The calendar continually does not allow for any appointmnets

Was looking for scheduling plugin to integrate for my site and remove an extra contact step with customer.
This did the trick. Even the basic plan is generously powerful and the whole thing is intuitive to set up.

I’ve tried others and this is by far the best! Easy to setup and customize to your liking. The subscription process takes time to load you into the system (about 30 mins) and you can’t register your subscription until it finishes. After that all good!
