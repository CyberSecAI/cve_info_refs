Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20608:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the "Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency" (CWE-130) in Mitsubishi Electric's GX Works2 software. Specifically, the software doesn't correctly handle a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data when reading a program file from a Mitsubishi Electric PLC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper input validation: The software fails to validate the length parameter against the actual data length when processing program files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition within the GX Works2 engineering software. This means the software becomes unresponsive or unusable. Note that the PLC itself is not impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable as an attacker can send malicious crafted packets to the PLC.
*   The attacker needs to tamper with a program file in a Mitsubishi Electric PLC, most likely by sending malicious crafted packets.
*   Then, the user needs to read the tampered program file into GX Works2.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the PLC and the system running GX Works2.
*   **Tampering Capability:** The attacker needs the capability to tamper with the program file on the PLC by sending crafted packets.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to open/load the tampered program file with GX Works2 (User Interaction: Required).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects GX Works2 versions 1.606G and prior.
*   The vulnerability does not cause the PLC to malfunction.
*   A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 is assigned, with a vector string of AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.
*   Mitigations include updating GX Works2 to version 1.610L or later, restricting network access to control systems, using firewalls and VPNs for remote access.
