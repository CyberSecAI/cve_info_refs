Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper validation of file uploads within the `PasswordExpiryNotification` interface of ManageEngine ADManager Plus Build 7111. This lack of validation allows an attacker to upload malicious files to the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system does not properly validate the type or content of uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files, specifically JSP files in this case.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Uploaded JSP files can be executed by accessing a specific URL, leading to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the ADMP server by uploading and accessing malicious JSP files.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can create administrative Windows users on the ADMP host through the executed code.
- **Domain Credential Theft:** Once having admin access on the ADMP host, the attacker can obtain the domain credentials used by ADMP which tend to have high privileges (i.e., a domain administrator).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **HTTP POST request:** An authenticated attacker sends a POST request to `/RestAPI/WC/PasswordExpiryNotification` to upload the malicious JSP file.
- **URL access:** The attacker can then execute the JSP code by fetching the JSP file at URL `/ompemberapp/PasswordExpiryNotification/<unixtime_miliseconds>_<filename>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of ManageEngine ADManager Plus.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable ADManager Plus server.

**Additional Details:**
- The uploaded JSP file is placed in the `<ADMP_DIR>\webapps\adsm\ompemberapp\PasswordExpiryNotification\` directory with the filename format of `<unixtime_milliseconds>_<filename>`.
- After gaining administrative access to the ADMP host, an attacker can obtain domain credentials used by the product by attaching a debugger to the ADMP Java process and breaking into the `ADsOpenObject` function in `ACTIVEDS.dll`.
- Tenable assigned the ID `TRA-2021-43` to this vulnerability.
