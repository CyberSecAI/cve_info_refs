- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A dynamically constructed href attribute in IBM Cloud Pak for Applications v4.3 allows for the embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to altering the intended functionality of the application and potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the web UI by embedding malicious JavaScript code into the dynamically constructed href attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript code through the web UI, indicating the attacker needs to have some level of access or control over input into the application.
