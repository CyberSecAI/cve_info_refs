### WHAT IS IT BUILT-IN META DATA CONSTRUCTOR?

Meta Data Constructor is what makes this plugin UNIQUE. No other search plugins come with such powerful and advanced features out of the box. All your searches are over—no pun intended and we really mean it! With this search plugin you can create custom meta-fields with simple clicks – no coding experience required. You choose how your search form(s) html-items should be presented on your site’s front end: with drop-down, checkboxes and/or range sliders, calendars, textinputs. For example you already have your own shop online, and like many you have come across other shops with very cool features and fancy search forms, with numerous options… Now you would like to see such a great form on your own site. But how could you achieve this without coding experience or paying a premium fee? Just [purchase](https://pluginus.net/affiliate/meta-data-taxonomies-filter) this plugin for a mere $25 and you will be able to create powerful search forms in no time, using our unique built-in Meta Data Constructor with meta fields and taxonomies. All is [documented](https://wp-filter.com/documentation/) with [videos](https://wp-filter.com/video-tutorials/). Example of a seacrh forms: If your shop already has a lot of meta-fields and you want to use them: built-in meta data constructor has a great tool for it called ‘Reflection’. How does it works ([step by steps instructions included in our comprehensive online documentation and videos](https://wp-filter.com/step-by-step/))? You can create a new html item via the built-in meta data constructor, for price as an example, it would be a range-slider, check checkbox ‘Reflect value from meta key’, and paste your old key in the newly enabled text area. Press Update. All done. From now on your old meta value is also searchable thanks to MDTF! Neat. There is a lot more you can do with this seacrh plugin of course, make sure to check the [documentation](https://wp-filter.com/documentation/) and watch our [videos](https://wp-filter.com/video-tutorials/). Thanks for your interest.[![video tutorial](/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif)](https://wp-filter.com/video-tutorials/)
