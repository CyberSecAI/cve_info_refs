Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improperly validated file uploads in the Personalization interface of ManageEngine ADManager Plus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files, specifically malicious executables, to the `<ADMP_DIR>\bin\` directory.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By replacing the `admanager.exe` with a malicious executable, the attacker achieves code execution when the ADManager Plus service restarts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting ManageEngine ADManager Plus.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can create an administrative Windows user on the ADMP host.
*   **Domain Credential Theft:**  Attackers can obtain domain credentials of high-privileged accounts (e.g. Domain Admin), by attaching a debugger to the ADMP Java process and inspecting the ADsOpenObject function call, which exposes the domain username and password. This allows attackers to perform Active Directory operations (such as creating user accounts and resetting passwords).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely by sending a crafted POST message.
*   **Specific Endpoint**: The POST message is sent to the `/RestAPI/WC/Personalize` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the ManageEngine ADManager Plus application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the ADManager Plus server to send the malicious POST message.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in ManageEngine ADManager Plus Build 7111 and prior.
*   The vendor has released a fix in Build 7113.
*   This vulnerability is related to CVE-2021-20130, which exploits similar upload functionality, but targets a different path.
