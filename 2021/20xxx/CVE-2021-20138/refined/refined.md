### CVE-2021-20138

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
The vulnerability exists in the `/cgi-bin/luci/rc` web interface of the Gryphon Tower router, where multiple parameters passed via a POST request are concatenated without proper sanitization and then executed using `os.execute()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated command injection: The application fails to sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the string being executed by the `os.execute()` function.
- Lack of input sanitization: User-provided input is directly used in a command executed by the system without any sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root on the device.
- Complete compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to full control of the vulnerable device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: An attacker on the same network as the router can exploit this vulnerability.
- HTTP POST Request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/rc` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Gryphon Tower router.
- No authentication: The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- Crafting HTTP Request: The attacker must be capable of crafting a malicious HTTP POST request.
