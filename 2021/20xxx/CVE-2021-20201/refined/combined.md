# OpenSSL(TLS/SSL) Security DoS Vulnerability - enables client-initiated renegotiation

It is a DoS threat to enable Secure Client-Initiated Renegotiation when using TLS. See [CVE-2011-1473](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-1473) for reference (disputed because it's not OpenSSL's role to fix this, but role of the apps like SPICE that use OpenSSL API).

[testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh/) may report that a server is vulnerable to CVE-2011-1473 (possible DoS due to client-side renegotiation) even if it only allows a limited number of renegotiation attempts. It concludes that after attempting only one renegotiation.

```
#bash testssl.sh -R X.X.X.X:9949

ATTENTION: No cipher mapping file found!
Please note from 2.9 on testssl.sh needs files in "$TESTSSL_INSTALL_DIR/etc/" to function correctly.

 Testing for Renegotiation vulnerabilities

 Secure Renegotiation (RFC 5746)           supported (OK)
 Secure Client-Initiated Renegotiation     VULNERABLE (NOT ok), potential DoS threat
```

More about this Threat See [<https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2011/10/31/tls-renegotiation-and-denial-of-service-attacks>

Apache, IIS, and Lighttpd have all fixed this problem in their latest releases.

**HOW TO FIX?**

1. Disable/Limit the ability for a client to initiate a renegotiation
   Example: Lighttpd 1.4.30 uses SSL\_CTX\_set\_info\_callback to count the number of times SSL\_CB\_HANDSHAKE\_START occurs.

```
static void ssl_info_callback(const SSL *ssl, int where, int ret) {
    UNUSED(ret);

    if (0 != (where & SSL_CB_HANDSHAKE_START)) {
        connection *con = SSL_get_app_data(ssl);
        ++con->renegotiations;
    } else if (0 != (where & SSL_CB_HANDSHAKE_DONE)) {
        ssl->s3->flags |= SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS;
    }
}
...
SSL_CTX_set_info_callback(s->ssl_ctx, ssl_info_callback);
...
```

2. Disable the ability for both side(client/server) to initiate a renegotiation

* OpenSSL 1.0.2 and below,

> OpenSSL 1.0.2 and below had the ability to disable renegotiation using the
> (undocumented) SSL3\_FLAGS\_NO\_RENEGOTIATE\_CIPHERS flag. Due to the opacity
> changes this is no longer possible in 1.1.0. Therefore the new
> SSL\_OP\_NO\_RENEGOTIATION option from 1.1.1-dev has been backported to
> 1.1.0 to provide equivalent functionality.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1904459#c0)  Julien Ropé    2020-12-04 14:21:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem: First reported here: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/-/issues/49>  When using TLS to secure the communication to the VM, SPICE is allowing client-initiated renegotiation of ciphers, which can be used to trigger a DoS attack on the host (see <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-1473>)   How reproducible: Using the testssl.sh script (from <https://testssl.sh/>), you can check the vulnerability of a service.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Setup secure connexion on a SPICE VM using TLS 2. Use testssl.sh to check for the vulnerability  Actual results: testssl.sh reports the following:  Secure Client-Initiated Renegotiation     VULNERABLE (NOT ok), potential DoS threat  Expected results:  Secure Client-Initiated Renegotiation     likely not vulnerable (OK), timed out   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1904459#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-05-18 16:09:30 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory (Low: spice security update), and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# TLS Renegotiation and Denial of Service Attacks

![Ivan Ristic](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/615600b2f75edf4501d758e2e868ee43?s=110&d=mm&r=g)

[October 31, 2011December 22, 2022](https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2011/10/31/tls-renegotiation-and-denial-of-service-attacks) - 2 min read

**Last updated on:** *December 22, 2022*

A group of hackers known as THC (The Hacker’s Choice) last week [released an interesting DoS tool](http://www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/) that works at the SSL/TLS layer. The tool is exploiting the fact that, when a new SSL connection is being negotiated, the server will typically spend significantly more CPU resources than the client. Thus, if you are requesting many new SSL connections per second, you may end up using all of the server’s CPU.

The issue abused by the tool is not new, but what is new is that we now have a well publicised working exploit, and that always makes you pay attention. In addition, the tool uses the renegotiation feature, which means that it can force a server to perform many expensive cryptographic operations over a single TCP connection. It’s not clear if the relying on renegotiation helps with the DoS attack (there’s a [very good analysis of the trade-offs on Eric Rescorla’s blog](http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2011/10/ssltls_and_computational_dos.html)), however the fact that external DoS mitigation tools (e.g., rate limiting setups) are only seeing one TCP connection certainly helps with avoiding detection.

But that’s only if your server supports client-initiated renegotiation. If it does not, anyone wishing to perform a DoS attack against the SSL layer will have to fall back to using one TCP connection for one SSL connection. IIS, for example, does not support client-initiated renegotiation. Apache used to, but changed its behaviour when implementing RFC 5746 (which fixed the [TLS Authentication Gap problem](http://blog.ivanristic.com/2009/11/ssl-and-tls-authentication-gap-vulnerability-discovered.html)). Even if you depend on a product that does support client-initiated renegotiation, chances are you can easily disable that feature. And, when you do, you are not going to miss it (unlike server-initiated renegotiation, which some sites that require client certificates might need).

To help you with assessing your systems for this weakness, we have updated the [SSL Labs assessment tool](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssldb/) to test not only if secure renegotiation is supported (which we’ve been testing for some time now), but also to check if secure client-initiated renegotiation is *enabled*. Previously we only tested for insecure client-initiated renegotiation.

The sensible thing to do is to check for client-initiated renegotiation support in your servers, and disable it where possible. Although that won’t substantially help you overall (defending against DoS attacks is notoriously difficult and expensive), it will harden your defences against this particular technique.

   Ivan,

   Since SSL Labs is able to detect if secure client-initiated renegotiation is enabled, it would be nice to have a QualysGuard QID to detect this as well.

   Right now we have the following QID that covers the MiTM aspect, but that can be mitigated and the web site could still be vulnerabilty to the DoS aspect.

   QID: 38596 – TLS Protocol Session Renegotiation Security Vulnerability – CVE-2009-3555

   Do you know if there are any plans to make this check a QID?

   Thanks,

   Jon

   Hello,

   Very interesting article. What strikes me as odd is that the OpenSSL library does not have a simple option bit to turn off this functionality. I looked at a patch for Apache that turns off the renegotiations, but that code strikes me as very low level.

   I’m trying to make a Python server that uses PyOpenSSL ignore/not support the renegotiations, but because OpenSSL doesn’t support this itself and the wrapper for Python does not allow the really low level access level that Apache uses, I can’t figure out how to do this. Does anybody have any suggestions how to accomplish this using PyOpenSSL?

   With kind regards,

   Sven

      Sven, thank you for mentioning that. I am actually in touch with OpenSSL developers, and will indicate this deficiency for a possible new feature/improvement.

   Any news about latest Apache/OpenSSL and disabling client-side renegotiations?

      No, no news. As far as I am aware, newer versions of Apache do not support client-initiated renegotiation at all.

         Ivan, any news regarding openSSL? I agree with Sven’s remark that there is no easy option in openSSL to disable client-initiated renegotiation (or maybe configure a max. number of client-initiated renegotiations after the initial handshake has been completed…) – but IMHO there should be such option.

         Since this discussion is around a while already, but I did not find any progress anywhere else either, I thought I’ll ask you first, before contacting openSSL…

   Thanks for the lucid writeup.

   Question:

   If you are a financial institution and are utilizing SGC or step-up then the client would renegotiate and that would be classified as a Fail on the test of "disallowing client initiated renegotiation". What do you reccommend here?

   How does one pass this test if one is a FI (Financial Institution)?

      Guarav,

      If you’re still deploying SGC certificates then you cannot pass the test (because SGC relies on renegotiation, as you said). At best, you could disable insecure renegotiation but enable weak cipher suites, and then deliver a message to your users to upgrade to a newer browser. But such error messages are not very strong, and should not actually be used.

      Are you in such situation? If so, I’d like to talk to you about how many SGC clients you are actually seeing. Please send me a private message. The last version of Internet Explorer to support SGC was IE 5.0 (5.0.1 was issued to remove SGC), so I am expecting that the number of SGC clients is very low.

    I notice that the latest version of SSLLabs server test report (v1.22.37) no longer reports secure client-initiated renegotiation as a vulnerability if enabled. Is this an intentional change or a regression in the test report?

    I too have the same question.

    “I noticed that the latest version of SSLLabs server test report no longer reports secure client-initiated renegotiation as a vulnerability if enabled. Is this an intentional change? Is secure client-initiated renegotiation not a vulnerability?”

    COMODO SSL Analyzer calls it out as vulnerable to DoS but nothing on the Q side.
