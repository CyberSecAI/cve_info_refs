Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-20069:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `regionalSettings.php` page in Racom's MIDGE Firmware fails to properly sanitize user-supplied parameters, specifically 'ntpServer' and 'ntpServer2', when passed to the `checkHost` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `ntpServer` and `ntpServer2` parameters. This code is then stored and executed when the regionalSettings page is rendered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the regionalSettings page. This can be used to:
    - Steal cookies
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/admin/regionalSettings.php` with malicious JavaScript in the `ntpServer` or `ntpServer2` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be authenticated to the M!DGE router with high privileges to access the `regionalSettings.php` page.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content provides significantly more detail than the basic description of the CVE, including:
    - The specific vulnerable parameters (`ntpServer` and `ntpServer2`).
    -  Proof of concept exploit code.
    - CVSS v3 vector ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)) is used to describe the XSS vulnerability in `regionalSettings.php`. Note: the actual CVSSv3 vector of CVE-2021-20069 is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, this content incorrectly labels it as S:U and with different CVSS score
    - The vulnerable firmware version: 4.4.40.105
    - The content also highlights a number of other vulnerabilities that were discovered alongside this one

**Summary**
The content details a stored XSS vulnerability in the `regionalSettings.php` page of Racom's MIDGE Firmware, stemming from improper sanitization of the `ntpServer` and `ntpServer2` parameters. An attacker with high privileges can exploit this by injecting malicious JavaScript, impacting users who access the vulnerable page. The provided material offers much more technical details than the initial CVE description.
