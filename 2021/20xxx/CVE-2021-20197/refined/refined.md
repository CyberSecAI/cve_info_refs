Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20197:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content directly relates to CVE-2021-20197. The bug reports, commit messages, and security advisories specifically mention the CVE ID, and describe the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from a **race condition** in the `smart_rename` function of GNU Binutils, and potentially in other utilities (`ar`, `objcopy`, `strip`, and `ranlib`). This race condition occurs because the function uses file names to perform permission changes (chown, chmod) on a target file, instead of operating directly on file descriptors. When used as a privileged user on a file inside a directory writable by an attacker, symlinks can be used to trick the function into changing ownership or permissions on arbitrary files, or to cause denial of service due to a segmentation fault.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:** The core issue is a TOCTOU vulnerability. The function checks whether a destination file is a symbolic link but then proceeds to use its name, rather than a file descriptor, in subsequent operations. This gap in time creates an exploitable race window. An attacker can manipulate the filesystem after the initial check to cause the operation to act on an unintended target.
   - **Unsafe Use of File Names:** Using filenames for permission-altering operations instead of file descriptors created by `mkstemp` allows an attacker to replace the original file with a symlink to a different file after the initial check. This leads to `chown` and `chmod` calls being applied to the attackerâ€™s file. This was caused by a flawed fix to ensure that permissions and ownership were preserved.
   - **Incorrect Handling of Temporary Files:** Initially, the code used `mkstemp` to create a temporary file but then immediately closed it and reopened it using its name (defeating the purpose of `mkstemp`). This allowed for the potential for symlink following issues.
   - **Missing Input Stat:** Some affected tools were using  `lstat` instead of `fstat` on the target file being overwritten.
   - **Insecure Use of `bfd_openw`:** The use of `bfd_openw` was not safe when a file descriptor is already available, which can be the case when writing archive outputs.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Arbitrary File Ownership Change:** An attacker can potentially gain ownership of arbitrary files on the system if the vulnerable utilities are run as a privileged user.
   - **Arbitrary File Permissions Change:** An attacker can potentially modify the permissions of arbitrary files on the system, including potentially making them SUID.
   - **Denial of Service:** Due to missing checks, ar could segfault during an attempt to preserve file permissions, and potentially other tools may also crash due to this.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Local Attack:** The vulnerability requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged attacker needs a privileged user to run the vulnerable binary on a file they can manipulate.
   - **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the target file system, specifically the ability to create symbolic links, and rename files within the target directory.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Local Access:** The attacker needs shell access to the target machine and the ability to execute commands as an unprivileged user.
   - **Writable Directory:** The target file must be in a directory where the attacker can create and rename files.
   - **Exploitation Window:** The attacker needs a time window between the file open and permission-setting to create the symlink.
   - **Privileged User Interaction:** The attacker needs a privileged user to execute the vulnerable binaries on a file under their control.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

   - The vulnerability was first discovered in the `smart_rename()` function but was later found to affect `ar`, `objcopy`, `strip`, and `ranlib` utilities.
    - The vulnerability was present in binutils versions prior to 2.38.
   - Upstream fixes involved using file descriptors from `make_tempname` and using `bfd_stat` rather than `fstat` on iostreams.
    - Fixes were implemented by making `smart_rename` accept FDs for both the source and the target files. It also implemented a function named `try_preserve_permissions`.

   - NetApp identified the vulnerability in the GNU binutils and categorized it as MEDIUM with a CVSS score of 6.3 and vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`.

   - Red Hat identified and patched the issue in their Enterprise Linux 8 and related products.
    - The Red Hat advisory includes a more detailed description and also mentions other related CVEs that were fixed at the same time.
    - The Red Hat advisory provides a "Moderate" security rating for this CVE.

   - Gentoo also issued a security advisory, GLSA 202208-30 and recommended all users to update to `sys-devel/binutils >= 2.38`

This analysis should help in understanding the nature, impact, and required steps to mitigate the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-20197.
