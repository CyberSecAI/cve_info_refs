- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Kagemai bug tracking system contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary script execution in the user's web browser, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious script into the Kagemai system. Any user accessing the affected page would then have the script executed in their browser. The attack vector is network-based and requires user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to input data into the Kagemai system that is later rendered in a web page. No authentication or special privileges are explicitly required to inject the malicious script, but they would need to find an input vector in the application. A user needs to view the page to be affected by the malicious script.
