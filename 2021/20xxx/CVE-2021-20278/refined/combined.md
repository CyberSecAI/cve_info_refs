| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1937171#c0)  Mark Cooper    2021-03-10 03:24:03 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in kiali v1.30.0 when the authentication strategy `OpenID` is used. When RBAC is enabled, Kiali assumes that some of the token validation is handled by the underlying cluster. Hence, when OpenID `implicit flow` is used with RBAC turned off, this token validation doesn't occur and may allow a malicious user to bypass the authentication.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1937171#c1)  Mark Cooper    2021-03-10 03:24:06 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://kiali.io/news/security-bulletins/kiali-security-002/>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1937171#c3)  Mark Cooper    2021-03-10 03:39:55 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/kiali/kiali/commit/19c9b64b76e5daf4fda46f783864cce5e4497a08>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1937171#c5)  Mark Cooper    2021-03-11 00:36:29 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Kiali Security Group   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1937171#c6)  RaTasha Tillery-Smith    2021-03-11 13:28:04 UTC  ``` Statement:  OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) Kiali is configured to delegate authorization to the OpenShift's RBAC user rights and the OpenID authentication strategy is not supported, therefore it is marked `not affected`.   ``` |  |

# KIALI-SECURITY-002 - Authentication bypass when using the OpenID login strategy

## Description

* **Disclosure date**: March 5, 2021
* **Affected Releases**: 1.26.0, 1.26.1, 1.26.2, 1.27.0, 1.28.0, 1.28.1, 1.29.0, 1.29.1, 1.30.0
* **Impact Score**: [7.0 - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:X/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:X/RC:C&version=3.1)

A vulnerability was found in Kiali allowing an attacker to bypass the
authentication mechanism. The vulnerability lets an attacker build forged
credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to Kiali.

Kiali users are exposed to this vulnerability if all the following conditions are met:

* Kiali is setup with the `openid` authentication strategy.
* As a result of configurations in both Kiali and your OpenID server, Kiali uses the
  *implicit flow* of the OpenID specification to negotiate authentication.
* Kiali is setup with RBAC turned off.

This vulnerability is filed as
[CVE-2021-20278](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-20278)

## Mitigation

If you can update:

* Update to Kiali v1.31.0 or later.
* If you need an earlier version, only Kiali 1.26.3 and 1.29.2 are fixed.

If you are locked with an older version of Kiali, you have three options:

* Configure Kiali to use the *authorization code* flow of the OpenID specification; or
* Configure Kiali to use the *implicit flow* of the OpenID specification *and* enable RBAC; or
* Configure Kiali to use any of the other available authentication mechanisms.
