Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-20278:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Kiali's handling of the OpenID authentication strategy, specifically when using the "implicit flow" with RBAC disabled. Kiali relies on the underlying cluster to perform token validation when RBAC is enabled. However, when RBAC is off and OpenID "implicit flow" is in use, this validation doesn't occur, allowing for forged credentials to be used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** The core vulnerability is that a malicious user can bypass Kiali's authentication mechanism.
- **Lack of Token Validation:** When using OpenID's implicit flow without RBAC, Kiali fails to perform proper token validation, which is a critical security weakness.
- **Assumption of Underlying Cluster Validation:** Kiali incorrectly assumes that the underlying cluster will handle token validation even when RBAC is disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to Kiali, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive information and other malicious activities.
- **Compromise of Kiali instance:**  Successful exploitation could grant access to Kiali's features and information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Forged Credentials:** Attackers can forge credentials that Kiali accepts when the described conditions are met.
- **Network-based attack:** Exploitation likely occurs through network requests directed at the vulnerable Kiali instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Kiali instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that Kiali is configured with `openid` authentication, using the `implicit flow` and that RBAC is disabled to craft the attack.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected versions:** Kiali versions 1.26.0, 1.26.1, 1.26.2, 1.27.0, 1.28.0, 1.28.1, 1.29.0, 1.29.1, and 1.30.0 are affected.
- **Mitigation:** Upgrading to Kiali v1.31.0 or later, or to specific fixed versions (1.26.3 or 1.29.2). Alternative mitigations include configuring Kiali to use the "authorization code" flow of the OpenID specification, enabling RBAC while using the implicit flow, or using another authentication method.
