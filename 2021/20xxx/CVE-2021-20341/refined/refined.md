- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Monitoring returns potentially sensitive information in headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Disclosure of potentially sensitive information in headers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The disclosure of sensitive information could potentially lead to further attacks against the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly stated, but likely through network requests that would reveal these headers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker capable of sending requests to the affected system and capturing the response headers.
