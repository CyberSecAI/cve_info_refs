Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. This occurs when the software does not properly validate the size of incoming data, leading to a write beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122): This is the primary vulnerability. It stems from insufficient bounds checking when processing incoming network packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition. The software crashes or becomes unresponsive due to the memory corruption, disrupting normal operations.
- Potential Arbitrary Code Execution: While not explicitly reproduced, the advisory notes there's a possibility of arbitrary code execution. This stems from the nature of a heap-based buffer overflow where an attacker could overwrite memory locations to alter program execution flow, potentially executing malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based Attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted network packets to the affected software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the system running the vulnerable software.
- Packet Spoofing: The attacker needs to be able to spoof MELSEC, GOT, or FREQROL devices and send crafted reply packets to the target software.
- Low Attack Complexity: The attack is characterized by low complexity. This likely implies that the exploitation does not require complex calculations or timing and is straightforward to execute.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Mitsubishi Electric FA Engineering Software products.
- The vulnerability is triggered by receiving crafted reply packets after the attacker spoofs a legitimate device.
- Mitigation involves updating to the patched versions of the software, or using provided workarounds such as operating with non-admin accounts, installing antivirus, and restricting network access.
- The advisory recommends installing updated versions of specific software (GX Works3, FR Configurator2, GT Designer3) as they provide comprehensive countermeasures that can mitigate the risk for other products as well.
- The provided information also mentions CVE-2021-20588, which is related, but is a separate vulnerability (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency) and is not analyzed here.
