Subject: CVE-2021-20263 QEMU: virtiofsd: 'security.capabilities' is not
 dropped with xattrmap option

Hello,

A flaw was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon
(virtiofsd) of QEMU. Virtio-fs is meant to share a host file system
directory with a guest virtual machine. The new 'xattrmap' option may
cause the 'security.capability' xattr in the guest to not drop on file
write, potentially leading to a modified, privileged executable in the
guest. In rare circumstances, this flaw could be used by a malicious
user to elevate their privileges within the guest.

For the problem to happen virtiofsd needs to be running with '-o
xattr' and '-o xattrmap' (to enable and rename xattrs, respectively).
The problem only occurs if 'security.capability' is one of the xattrs
that's being renamed. Different caching modes cause different guest
behavior: '-o cache=none' makes the issue easy to reproduce. There's a
suspicion the flaw could be reproduced with the default option '-o
cache=auto' as well.

The impact of this flaw is limited by the fact that xattrmap is a
recent feature that's little used so far. Additionally, unprivileged
users shouldn't be granted write permission on privileged executables
in the first place.

Virtiofsd 'xattrmap' feature in QEMU 5.2:

Upstream patch:

This issue was reported by Dr. David Alan Gilbert (CC'd).

CVE-2021-20263 assigned by Red Hat, Inc.

### tools/virtiofsd: xattr name mappings: Add option

```

Add an option to define mappings of xattr names so that
the client and server filesystems see different views.
This can be used to have different SELinux mappings as
seen by the guest, to run the virtiofsd with less privileges
(e.g. in a case where it can't set trusted/system/security
xattrs but you want the guest to be able to), or to isolate
multiple users of the same name; e.g. trusted attributes
used by stacking overlayfs.

A mapping engine is used with 3 simple rules; the rules can
be combined to allow most useful mapping scenarios.
The ruleset is defined by -o xattrmap='rules...'.

This patch doesn't use the rule maps yet.

## [PATCH] virtiofs: drop remapped security.capability xattr as needed

| **Subject**: | [PATCH] virtiofs: drop remapped security.capability xattr as needed |
| **Date**: | Thu, 4 Mar 2021 10:24:45 +0000 |

---

```
From: "Dr. David Alan Gilbert" <dgilbert@redhat.com>

On Linux, the 'security.capability' xattr holds a set of
capabilities that can change when an executable is run, giving
a limited form of privilege escalation to those programs that
the writer of the file deemed worthy.

Any write causes the 'security.capability' xattr to be dropped,
stopping anyone from gaining privilege by modifying a blessed
file.

Fuse relies on the daemon to do this dropping, and in turn the
daemon relies on the host kernel to drop the xattr for it.  However,
with the addition of -o xattrmap, the xattr that the guest
stores its capabilities in is now not the same as the one that
the host kernel automatically clears.

Where the mapping changes 'security.capability', explicitly clear
the remapped name to preserve the same behaviour.

This bug is assigned CVE-2021-20263.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1933668#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-03-01 11:32:09 UTC  ``` The new '-o xattrmap' option in virtiofsd causes some cases in which the 'security.capability' xattr in the guest isn't dropped on write, potentially leading to a modified privileged executable. For the problem to happen virtiofsd needs to be running with '-o xattr' and '-o xattrmap' (to enable and rename xattrs, respectively). The problem only occurs if 'security.capability' is one of the xattrs that is being renamed. Different caching modes cause different guest behavior: '-o cache=none' makes the issue easy to reproduce but it may also occur with '-o cache=auto' as well.  Virtiofsd 'xattrmap' feature in QEMU 5.2: <https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/qemu/-/commit/6084633dff3a05d6317>  Upstream fix: <https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=e586edcb410543768ef009eaa22a2d9dd4a53846>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1933668#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-03-01 11:32:29 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: David Alan Gilbert (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1933668#c3)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2021-03-04 10:39:51 UTC  ``` Patch posted to qemu-devel: <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-03/msg01244.html>  and pull sent upstream.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1933668#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-03-04 11:13:33 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1935089](show_bug.cgi?id=1935089 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-20263 qemu: virtiofsd: 'security.capabilities' is not dropped with xattrmap option [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1933668#c6)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2021-03-04 13:51:30 UTC  ``` Merged upstream qemu: e586edcb410543768ef009eaa22a2d9dd4a53846   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1933668#c7)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-03-08 15:02:31 UTC  ``` Note that the impact of this flaw is limited by the fact that xattrmap is a recent feature that's little used so far. Additionally, unprivileged users shouldn't be granted write permission on privileged executables in the first place.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1933668#c8)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-03-08 15:05:04 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of QEMU as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and RHEL Advanced Virtualization, as they did not include support for the 'xattrmap' feature.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1933668#c10)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-03-08 15:41:58 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/08/1>   ``` |  |
