Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-20173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Unsanitized input is passed to the `system()` function within the `upnpd` binary. Specifically, values from the device's configuration are used in `wget` commands that are executed when checking for updates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:**  The vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution by injecting malicious code into the device's configuration variables (`ver_check_stringtable_dat`, etc.) that are later used in `system()` calls.
- Lack of input sanitization

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete compromise** of the device - An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the router. This allows for actions like:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Installation of malware
    - Complete device control
    - Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SOAP Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to the device's SOAP interface (specifically the `CheckNewFirmware` action of `DeviceConfig` service).
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's SOAP interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:**  The attacker needs to be authenticated on the device before exploiting this vulnerability.  This implies they would require access to user credentials.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the router.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists due to the usage of `snprintf` to construct shell commands passed to `system()`. The values for the parameters used in `wget` are pulled from configuration which can be manipulated.
- The specific commands that are vulnerable include three instances which utilize wget to check for firmware updates.
- Example of injectable variable is `ver_check_stringtable_dat`
- A sample SOAP request is provided to trigger the update check functionality that executes the vulnerable commands.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Netgear Nighthawk R6700 v3 devices with firmware version 1.0.4.120.
- Tenable assigned a CVSS vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H to this vulnerability. However the NVD has a CVSS score of 8.8 with vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
