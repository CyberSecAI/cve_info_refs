Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the "Order Status Batch Change Plug-in" for EC-CUBE 3.0, developed by ActiveFusions Co., Ltd.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into specific input fields within the EC-CUBE management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** If a specially crafted script is injected, it will be executed within the web browser of an administrator of the affected EC-CUBE website. This could lead to various malicious activities.
*   **Potential for data theft and manipulation:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, alter data, or perform actions on behalf of the administrator, depending on the injected script's payload.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as it involves injecting a script via the web interface.
*   **Specific Input Field:** An attacker needs to identify and target a vulnerable input field within the EC-CUBE management pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the EC-CUBE instance and its management interface.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable input field:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable input field in the management page of EC-CUBE.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attack requires the administrator of the EC-CUBE instance to interact with the malicious content, likely by viewing the page containing the injected script. (Based on CVSS)

**Additional Details:**
*   The plugin is no longer supported by the vendor, and users are advised to stop using it.
*   The vulnerability was reported to IPA by ActiveFusions Co., Ltd and coordinated under the Information Security Early Warning Partnership.

**CVSS Scores:**

*   **CVSS v3:** 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
*   **CVSS v2:** 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
