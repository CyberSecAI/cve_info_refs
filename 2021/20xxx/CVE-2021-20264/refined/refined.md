Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect file permissions being applied to `/etc/passwd` within several OpenJDK container images. Specifically, these permissions allow users other than root to modify the file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive file permissions on `/etc/passwd`, allowing non-root users to modify it.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This insecure permission setting enables privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive user information by modifying the passwd file
*   **Integrity Breach:**  The system's user accounts and their configuration can be altered.
*   **System Availability:** The attacker may disrupt the system's operation by modifying the user database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can add a new user with administrative privileges, gaining full control over the container.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Container Access:** The attacker must have some form of access to the running container. This could be through a compromised application running within the container, or some form of container escape

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a foothold within the vulnerable container environment, sufficient to execute commands and modify files.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable containers include:
    *   `ubi8/openjdk-8`
    *   `ubi8/openjdk-11`
    *  `openjdk/openjdk-11-rhel7`
    *   `redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift`
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in Red Hat Build of OpenJDK via errata RHSA-2021:0945 and RHSA-2021:0946.
