- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the Dashboard User Interface of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** The document does not provide specific details on the impact of exploitation but XSS vulnerabilities can typically allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of websites, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The document does not provide explicit attack vectors. The vulnerability is in the Dashboard User Interface of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator, which would imply that an attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts through a vector that the dashboard UI is vulnerable to.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code through the user interface. It does not explicitly state if any authentication or other preconditions are needed, but generally such vulnerabilities can often be exploited with a logged-in user session.
