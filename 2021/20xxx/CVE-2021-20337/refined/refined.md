- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM QRadar SIEM is using weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The use of weak cryptographic algorithms can potentially lead to compromise of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks exploiting the weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or interact with the network traffic using the affected algorithms.
