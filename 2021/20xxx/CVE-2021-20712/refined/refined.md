Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a defect in the IPv6 firewall functionality of the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The IPv6 firewall function does not properly restrict access, allowing unauthorized network access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Devices connected to the LAN side of the affected routers may become accessible from the WAN side, or other external networks, bypassing the firewall's intended restrictions.
- This could allow attackers to potentially access services, data or devices on the LAN which should have been protected by the firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker needs network connectivity to reach the WAN interface of the vulnerable device.
- The vulnerability exists in the IPv6 firewall functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the WAN interface of the affected router. This could involve the attacker being on a public network or having some form of external network access.
- No special privileges or user interaction is needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- Aterm WG2600HS
- Aterm WX3000HP

**Affected Versions:**
- Aterm WG2600HS: Ver1.5.1 and earlier
- Aterm WX3000HP: Ver1.1.2 and earlier

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability does not require any authentication or privileged access on the device.
- The vulnerability is specific to the IPv6 firewall implementation.

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing specific details about the affected devices, the vulnerability's nature, the attack vectors, and the impact of a successful exploit.
