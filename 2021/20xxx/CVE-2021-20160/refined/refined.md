  "CVE-2021-20160": {
    "Description": "Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains a command injection vulnerability in the smb functionality of the device. The username parameter used when configuring smb functionality for the device is vulnerable to command injection as root.",
    "Root cause": "The system() call used in the SMB functionality is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'smb_admin_name' parameter.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary command execution as root on the device.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be authenticated (low privilege) on the device web interface to configure SMB functionality."
  },
   "CVE-2021-20161": {
    "Description": "Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient protections for the UART functionality. A malicious actor with physical access to the device is able to connect to the UART port via a serial connection. No username or password is required and the user is given a root shell with full control of the device.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of authentication or protection on the UART serial connection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
       "Missing Authentication",
       "Insecure Serial Port"
    ],
    "Impact": "Full control of the device with root privileges.",
     "Attack vectors": "Physical access to the device is required to connect to the UART port.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have physical access to the device and the ability to connect to its UART port."
  },
    "CVE-2021-20162": {
    "Description": "Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 stores credentials in plaintext. Usernames and passwords are stored in plaintext in the config files on the device. For example, /etc/config/cameo contains the admin password in plaintext.",
    "Root cause": "Storing sensitive data (usernames and passwords) in plaintext in configuration files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information"
    ],
   "Impact": "Exposure of sensitive credentials, which could lead to unauthorized access and control of the device.",
     "Attack vectors": "Attacker needs access to the device configuration files to retrieve credentials",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have high privileges on the device to access config files, or have the ability to obtain a backup of the device configuration."
   },
    "CVE-2021-20163": {
    "Description": "Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 leaks information via the ftp web page. Usernames and passwords for all ftp users are revealed in plaintext on the ftpserver.asp page.",
      "Root cause": "Exposing sensitive user information in plaintext on the FTP setup web page.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Cleartext Storage of Credentials"
     ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of sensitive FTP credentials.",

   },
      "CVE-2021-20159": {
    "Description": "Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 is vulnerable to command injection. The system log functionality of the firmware allows for command injection as root by supplying a malformed parameter.",
     "Root cause": "Improper handling of user input in the syslog functionality, leading to command injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
       "Command Injection",
       "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
     "Impact": "Arbitrary command execution as root on the device.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the device's web interface. It involves corrupting a configuration file and then triggering the vulnerable code.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs low privileges on the device to access the syslog functionality configuration page."
    },
      "CVE-2021-20157": {
        "Description": "It is possible for an unauthenticated, malicious user to force the device to reboot due to a hidden administrative command.",
      "Root cause":"The device allows unauthenticated requests to initiate a reboot via a specific HTTP request.",
     "Weaknesses": [
       "Missing Authentication",
       "Unprotected Administrative Functionality"
      ],
        "Impact": "Denial of service due to device reboot.",
        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by sending a specific POST request.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs no authentication to trigger this vulnerability."

      "CVE-2021-20158": {
        "Description": "Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. It is possible for an unauthenticated, malicous actor to force the change of the admin password due to a hidden administrative command.",
        "Root cause": "The device allows unauthenticated password changes via a hidden administrative command.",
        "Weaknesses": [
         "Authentication Bypass",
         "Unprotected Administrative Functionality"
         ],
