  "CVE-2021-20071": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the sms.php dialogs.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is initiated by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable sms.php dialogs.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device with high level privilages and convince a victim to interact with the crafted request in their browser."
  },
    "CVE-2021-20068": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "User-supplied parameters are passed to a function called setError which then stores them in a file located at /var/log/nblog. The contents of the nblog file are then displayed on the web user interface and rendered for authenticated and unauthenticated users.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary javascript into the user-supplied parameters which will be executed whenever the web user interface is rendered, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is initiated by sending a crafted request to the device, causing an error and storing a malicious payload in the error log.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device."

    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the virtualization.php dialogs.",

      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.",

    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the regionalSettings.php dialogs.",

      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.",

    "CVE-2021-20072": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Authenticated directory traversal vulnerability in the configuration and tcpdump download functionality",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
       "Directory traversal",
        "Arbitrary File Read",
        "Arbitrary File Deletion"
    ],
       "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read any file on the filesystem of the device, including sensitive files like /etc/shadow. They can also delete files, which can render the device unusable.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is initiated by sending a crafted GET request to downloadFile.php with directory traversal sequences in the dfile parameter.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device as an admin user."
  },
    "CVE-2021-20073": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks CSRF protection.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform actions on the device on behalf of an authenticated user, potentially leading to unauthorized changes, data exfiltration, or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious website that, when visited by an authenticated user, triggers malicious requests to the vulnerable device.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to visit a malicious website, and the attacker needs to know the IP address of the router."
  },
    "CVE-2021-20074": {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The command line interface allows users to escape the restricted shell.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
         "OS Command Injection"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the device, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is initiated by using a command to escape the restricted CLI shell such as `ssh <user>@<router_address> /bin/ash`.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a low-level user account with CLI access."
