- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server in IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) does not include the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header in internally generated error responses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing HSTS header in error responses, leading to insecure HTTP connections.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could potentially intercept sensitive information transmitted over an insecure HTTP connection.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network-based attack by intercepting insecure HTTP traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept the communication between the client and the ISIQ server. They do not need prior access to the system.
