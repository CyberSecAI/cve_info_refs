{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the Spark Gateway component in ManageEngine OpManager due to improper validation of user-supplied data prior to a directory deletion operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to delete arbitrary directories on the OS. Although the specific 'recordingFile' is not deleted as it is in use, other files and sub-directories within the specified directory can be deleted. This can lead to a denial of service by deleting critical OpManager files and can render the host unstable and unusable. The attack can be used to delete the entire C drive recursively on a Windows-based OpManager host.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP request to the /RDP endpoint, providing a manipulated 'server' parameter that contains path traversal sequences.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the affected ManageEngine OpManager instance. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability."
  },
  "additional_info": {
    "solution": "Update ManageEngine OpManager to build version 125362.",
