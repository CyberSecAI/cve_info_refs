Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-20206:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `containernetworking-cni` package, specifically its handling of the `type` field in CNI configurations. This field, which specifies which plugin to load, allows for arbitrary path injection using elements like "../".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. An attacker can use path manipulation sequences within the `type` field to access and execute files outside the intended CNI plugin directory.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By traversing to unintended file paths, an attacker can execute arbitrary binaries already present on the system, including those that are not intended to be CNI plugins (e.g. `reboot`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive files and directories on the system, leading to information disclosure.
- **Integrity:** Modification of existing files or creating new ones is possible, enabling an attacker to compromise the integrity of the system.
- **Availability:** The vulnerability could be exploited to cause denial of service, by executing arbitrary commands such as reboot.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious CNI configuration file, specifically crafted with "../" sequences to point to an arbitrary path.
- The vulnerable `type` field of the CNI configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to specify CNI configuration files to be loaded by the system.
- The attacker must have knowledge of binaries present on the system they wish to execute.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional Details (from the content that goes beyond CVE description):**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of the `github.com/containernetworking/cni/pkg/invoke` package before 0.8.1.
- The vulnerability is present in the generated code from the `gogo/protobuf` library and applications that use the library to unmarshal data.
- This issue is seen in various Red Hat products like OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes and others because they use components with the vulnerable code.
- The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker by crafting a malicious CNI config and may lead to system compromise via inference end points on AI systems.
- Red Hat rates the impact of this vulnerability as "Moderate".
- Fixes have been implemented in various Red Hat products and have been distributed via errata.

**Affected Products (from content):**

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.8
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.7
