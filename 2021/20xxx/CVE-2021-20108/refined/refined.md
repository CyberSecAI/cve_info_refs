Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-20108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from memory leaks within the Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent when processing commands received over HTTPS. Specifically, the agent fails to free allocated memory after processing commands, both for the initial allocation of 0x66 bytes via malloc and for the unicode conversion of the command itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unverified HTTPS Certificates:** The agent does not verify HTTPS certificates, allowing an attacker to send commands over port 9000.
*   **Memory Leaks:** The `AEAgent.cpp` allocates 0x66 bytes of memory which is never freed. Additionally the conversion to unicode of the command string results in further unfreed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly sending commands to the agent, an attacker can cause the agent to exhaust its memory resources, eventually crashing the agent due to an out-of-memory condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based Attack:** An attacker can be any arbitrary user on the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable agent and have the ability to send network traffic.
*   **Command Injection:** The attacker sends crafted commands over port 9000 to the agent. While the commands themselves might not be executed due to token validation, the memory leak occurs when the agent processes them and reaches out to the server over HTTP.
