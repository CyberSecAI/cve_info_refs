Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20399:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper processing of XML data, which allows for an XML External Entity (XXE) Injection attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The core issue is an XXE vulnerability, meaning that the application parses XML input that can include references to external entities. This allows an attacker to control the XML input and potentially force the application to load external files or URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The content does not specify precise impact details beyond being an XXE vulnerability. However, XXE vulnerabilities can lead to:
  - **Confidentiality:** Exposure of sensitive data from the server, such as configuration files, internal files, or data within the application.
  - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Ability to make the server initiate connections to internal and external systems.
  - **Denial of Service:** By referencing large files or infinite loops.
- The specific impact depends on the internal configuration of the vulnerable IBM QRadar SIEM instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- **XML data Processing:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted XML data to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted XML input to the vulnerable IBM QRadar SIEM instance. This likely means the attack vector would be through a network or web interface exposed by the application.
- The specific access required depends on the vulnerable entry point that processes the XML data.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM QRadar SIEM 7.3.0 to 7.3.3 Patch 8
- IBM QRadar SIEM 7.4.0 to 7.4.3 GA

**Remediation:**
- Apply the provided patches:
  - QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF / QNI 7.3.3 Patch 9
  - QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF / QNI 7.4.3 Patch 1
