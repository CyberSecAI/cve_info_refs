### @cipherboy **[cipherboy](/cipherboy)** commented [Mar 12, 2021](#issue-830145881)

Due to a recent change in PKI CLI, the CLI now passes along user

authentication with submissions to the renewal endpoint. Unlike the EE

pages, the REST API has passed along this authentication for a while.

Due to a bug in the `RenewalProcessor`, requests with credentials against

profiles with no authentication method and no ACLs result in the

certificiate automatically being approved. This occurs because, when

an earlier commit ([cb9eb96](https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/cb9eb967b5e24f5fde8bbf8ae87aa615b7033db7)) modified

the code to allow Light-Weight SubCAs to issue certificates, validation

wasn't done on the passed principal, to see if it was a trusted agent.

Because profiles requiring Agent approval have an empty ACL list (as, no

user should be able to submit a certificate request and have it

automatically signed without agent approval), authorize allows any user

to approve this request and thus accepts the AuthToken.

Critical analysis: the `RenewalProcessor` code interprets (`authToken`

`!= null`) as evidence that the authenticated user is *authorized* to

immediately issue the certificate. This mismatch of concerns (`authn`

vs `authz`) resulted in a misunderstanding of system behaviour. The

"latent" `AuthToken` (from the HTTP request) was assigned to `authToken`

without realising that authorization needed to be performed.

We fix this by splitting the logic on whether the profile defines an

authenticator. If so, we (re)authenticate and authorize the user

according to the profile configuration.

If the profile does not define an authenticator but there is a

principal in the HTTP request, if (and only if) the user has

permission to approve certificate requests *and* the requested

renewal profile is `caManualRenewal` (which is hardcoded to be used

for LWCA renewal), then we issue the certificate immediately. This

special case ensures that LWCA renewal keeps working.

Otherwise, if there is no principal in the HTTP request or the

principal does not have permission to approve certificate requests,

we leave the authToken unset. The resulting renewal request will be

created with status PENDING, i.e. enqueued for agent review.

### @cipherboy **[cipherboy](/cipherboy)** commented [Mar 12, 2021](#issue-830139626)

Due to a recent change in PKI CLI, the CLI now passes along user

authentication with submissions to the renewal endpoint. Unlike the EE

pages, the REST API has passed along this authentication for a while.

Due to a bug in the `RenewalProcessor`, requests with credentials against

profiles with no authentication method and no ACLs result in the

certificiate automatically being approved. This occurs because, when

an earlier commit ([cb9eb96](https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/cb9eb967b5e24f5fde8bbf8ae87aa615b7033db7)) modified

the code to allow Light-Weight SubCAs to issue certificates, validation

wasn't done on the passed principal, to see if it was a trusted agent.

Because profiles requiring Agent approval have an empty ACL list (as, no

user should be able to submit a certificate request and have it

automatically signed without agent approval), authorize allows any user

to approve this request and thus accepts the AuthToken.

Critical analysis: the `RenewalProcessor` code interprets (`authToken`

`!= null`) as evidence that the authenticated user is *authorized* to

immediately issue the certificate. This mismatch of concerns (`authn`

vs `authz`) resulted in a misunderstanding of system behaviour. The

"latent" `AuthToken` (from the HTTP request) was assigned to `authToken`

without realising that authorization needed to be performed.

We fix this by splitting the logic on whether the profile defines an

authenticator. If so, we (re)authenticate and authorize the user

according to the profile configuration.

If the profile does not define an authenticator but there is a

principal in the HTTP request, if (and only if) the user has

permission to approve certificate requests *and* the requested

renewal profile is `caManualRenewal` (which is hardcoded to be used

for LWCA renewal), then we issue the certificate immediately. This

special case ensures that LWCA renewal keeps working.

Otherwise, if there is no principal in the HTTP request or the

principal does not have permission to approve certificate requests,

we leave the authToken unset. The resulting renewal request will be

created with status PENDING, i.e. enqueued for agent review.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### @cipherboy **[cipherboy](/cipherboy)** commented [Mar 12, 2021](#issue-830148784)

Due to a recent change in PKI CLI, the CLI now passes along user

authentication with submissions to the renewal endpoint. Unlike the EE

pages, the REST API has passed along this authentication for a while.

Due to a bug in the `RenewalProcessor`, requests with credentials against

profiles with no authentication method and no ACLs result in the

certificiate automatically being approved. This occurs because, when

an earlier commit ([cb9eb96](https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/cb9eb967b5e24f5fde8bbf8ae87aa615b7033db7)) modified

the code to allow Light-Weight SubCAs to issue certificates, validation

wasn't done on the passed principal, to see if it was a trusted agent.

Because profiles requiring Agent approval have an empty ACL list (as, no

user should be able to submit a certificate request and have it

automatically signed without agent approval), authorize allows any user

to approve this request and thus accepts the AuthToken.

Critical analysis: the `RenewalProcessor` code interprets (`authToken`

`!= null`) as evidence that the authenticated user is *authorized* to

immediately issue the certificate. This mismatch of concerns (`authn`

vs `authz`) resulted in a misunderstanding of system behaviour. The

"latent" `AuthToken` (from the HTTP request) was assigned to `authToken`

without realising that authorization needed to be performed.

We fix this by splitting the logic on whether the profile defines an

authenticator. If so, we (re)authenticate and authorize the user

according to the profile configuration.

If the profile does not define an authenticator but there is a

principal in the HTTP request, if (and only if) the user has

permission to approve certificate requests *and* the requested

renewal profile is `caManualRenewal` (which is hardcoded to be used

for LWCA renewal), then we issue the certificate immediately. This

special case ensures that LWCA renewal keeps working.

Otherwise, if there is no principal in the HTTP request or the

principal does not have permission to approve certificate requests,

we leave the authToken unset. The resulting renewal request will be

created with status PENDING, i.e. enqueued for agent review.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

### @cipherboy **[cipherboy](/cipherboy)** commented [Mar 12, 2021](#issue-830142989)

Due to a recent change in PKI CLI, the CLI now passes along user

authentication with submissions to the renewal endpoint. Unlike the EE

pages, the REST API has passed along this authentication for a while.

Due to a bug in the `RenewalProcessor`, requests with credentials against

profiles with no authentication method and no ACLs result in the

certificiate automatically being approved. This occurs because, when

an earlier commit ([cb9eb96](https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/cb9eb967b5e24f5fde8bbf8ae87aa615b7033db7)) modified

the code to allow Light-Weight SubCAs to issue certificates, validation

wasn't done on the passed principal, to see if it was a trusted agent.

Because profiles requiring Agent approval have an empty ACL list (as, no

user should be able to submit a certificate request and have it

automatically signed without agent approval), authorize allows any user

to approve this request and thus accepts the AuthToken.

Critical analysis: the `RenewalProcessor` code interprets (`authToken`

`!= null`) as evidence that the authenticated user is *authorized* to

immediately issue the certificate. This mismatch of concerns (`authn`

vs `authz`) resulted in a misunderstanding of system behaviour. The

"latent" `AuthToken` (from the HTTP request) was assigned to `authToken`

without realising that authorization needed to be performed.

We fix this by splitting the logic on whether the profile defines an

authenticator. If so, we (re)authenticate and authorize the user

according to the profile configuration.

If the profile does not define an authenticator but there is a

principal in the HTTP request, if (and only if) the user has

permission to approve certificate requests *and* the requested

renewal profile is `caManualRenewal` (which is hardcoded to be used

for LWCA renewal), then we issue the certificate immediately. This

special case ensures that LWCA renewal keeps working.

Otherwise, if there is no principal in the HTTP request or the

principal does not have permission to approve certificate requests,

we leave the authToken unset. The resulting renewal request will be

created with status PENDING, i.e. enqueued for agent review.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2020-10-23 14:42:25 UTC  ``` The search query is reflected back to the user, and injected in a form, so that the user can click on the "next page", etc. However, a specially crafted POST request can be used to reflect a DOM XSS, which can get automatically executed.   The XSS requires the victim to have installed their RHCS certificate in the web browser. If that certificate has sufficient permissions, the XSS can be used to execute arbitrary code, including sending and signing arbitrary certificates.  Vulnerable page : /ca/ee/ca/listCerts (there might be other pages vulnerable to a similar attack)  ``` document.write( "<button NAME=begin onClick='doNext(this)' VALUE='|<<' width='72'>|<<</button>\n"+ "<button "+disabledUp+" NAME=up onClick='doNext(this)' VALUE='<' width='72'><</button>\n"+ [...] "<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=skipNonValid VALUE='"+ (result.header.skipNonValid ? result.header.skipNonValid : "") + "'>\n"+ ```  Several POST parameters, including `skipNonValid`, are being reflected back to the browser without having been sanitized by the server. An attacker can use that to inject JavaScript in the DOM.  Attack scenario : A victim authenticated in RHCS web UI (the corresponding web browser has the required key/cert installed for client authentication), is tricked into clicking a button on an attacker-controlled website. The XSS can then be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of RHCS.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c7)  Eric Christensen    2021-02-11 18:30:25 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Because the cross-site scripting (XSS) attack requires the victim to have their RHCS certificate installed in their web browser to be successful, it is recommended that web browser not hold the keys and that the user use the command line interface (CLI) instead.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c8)  Cedric Buissart    2021-03-02 15:27:57 UTC  ``` Created pki-core tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1934142](show_bug.cgi?id=1934142 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-25715 pki-core: XSS in the certificate search results [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c11)  Cedric Buissart    2021-03-03 20:44:42 UTC  ``` Upstream fix :  <https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/13f4c7fe7d71d42b46b25f3e8472ef7f35da5dd6>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-15 13:26:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2021:0819 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0819](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0819)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c17)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-03-15 17:25:48 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

### @cipherboy **[cipherboy](/cipherboy)** commented [Mar 12, 2021](#issue-830144597)

Due to a recent change in PKI CLI, the CLI now passes along user

authentication with submissions to the renewal endpoint. Unlike the EE

pages, the REST API has passed along this authentication for a while.

Due to a bug in the `RenewalProcessor`, requests with credentials against

profiles with no authentication method and no ACLs result in the

certificiate automatically being approved. This occurs because, when

an earlier commit ([cb9eb96](https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/cb9eb967b5e24f5fde8bbf8ae87aa615b7033db7)) modified

the code to allow Light-Weight SubCAs to issue certificates, validation

wasn't done on the passed principal, to see if it was a trusted agent.

Because profiles requiring Agent approval have an empty ACL list (as, no

user should be able to submit a certificate request and have it

automatically signed without agent approval), authorize allows any user

to approve this request and thus accepts the AuthToken.

Critical analysis: the `RenewalProcessor` code interprets (`authToken`

`!= null`) as evidence that the authenticated user is *authorized* to

immediately issue the certificate. This mismatch of concerns (`authn`

vs `authz`) resulted in a misunderstanding of system behaviour. The

"latent" `AuthToken` (from the HTTP request) was assigned to `authToken`

without realising that authorization needed to be performed.

We fix this by splitting the logic on whether the profile defines an

authenticator. If so, we (re)authenticate and authorize the user

according to the profile configuration.

If the profile does not define an authenticator but there is a

principal in the HTTP request, if (and only if) the user has

permission to approve certificate requests *and* the requested

renewal profile is `caManualRenewal` (which is hardcoded to be used

for LWCA renewal), then we issue the certificate immediately. This

special case ensures that LWCA renewal keeps working.

Otherwise, if there is no principal in the HTTP request or the

principal does not have permission to approve certificate requests,

we leave the authToken unset. The resulting renewal request will be

created with status PENDING, i.e. enqueued for agent review.

```
Due to a recent change in PKI CLI, the CLI now passes along user
authentication with submissions to the renewal endpoint. Unlike the EE
pages, the REST API has passed along this authentication for a while.
Due to a bug in the RenewalProcessor, requests with credentials against
profiles with no authentication method and no ACLs result in the
certificiate automatically being approved. This occurs because, when
an earlier commit ([cb9eb96](https://github.com/cipherboy/pki/commit/cb9eb967b5e24f5fde8bbf8ae87aa615b7033db7)) modified
the code to allow Light-Weight SubCAs to issue certificates, validation
wasn't done on the passed principal, to see if it was a trusted agent.
Because profiles requring Agent approval have an empty ACL list (as, no
user should be able to submit a certificate request and have it
automatically signed without agent approval), authorize allows any user
to approve this request and thus accepts the AuthToken.

Critical analysis: the RenewalProcessor code interprets (authToken
!= null) as evidence that the authenticated user is /authorized/ to
immediately issue the certificate.  This mismatch of concerns (authn
vs authz) resulted in a misunderstanding of system behaviour.  The
"latent" AuthToken (from the HTTP request) was assigned to authToken
without realising that authorization needed to be performed.

We fix this by splitting the logic on whether the profile defines an
authenticator.  If so, we (re)authenticate and authorize the user
according to the profile configuration.

If the profile does not define an authenticator but there is a
principal in the HTTP request, if (and only if) the user has
permission to approve certificate requests *and* the requested
renewal profile is caManualRenewal (which is hardcoded to be used
for LWCA renewal), then we issue the certificate immediately.  This
special case ensures that LWCA renewal keeps working.

Otherwise, if there is no principal in the HTTP request or the
principal does not have permission to approve certificate requests,
we leave the authToken unset.  The resulting renewal request will be
created with status PENDING, i.e. enqueued for agent review.

The patch looks good, but for some reason the tests are failing. I suppose it's caused by a different issue. Let me investigate this, and also wait for [@ladycfu](https://github.com/ladycfu) if she has any other comment on this patch, then I'll merge the patch for all branches. Thanks!

Sorry, something went wrong.

| The tests are failing due to a DS issue that has been fixed in `v10.9` branch, so I think we can merge this PR safely. The IPA test will still fail since IPA is using PKI 10.10 on all Fedora platforms now. We might just drop the IPA test from `v10.9`. That can be done separately later. |
