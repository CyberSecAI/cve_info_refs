Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Session Fixation

**Root Cause:** The document indicates that the vulnerability is a session fixation issue in IBM Sterling File Gateway. However, it does not provide specific technical details of how the session fixation vulnerability is triggered.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the way the application handles session IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session by fixing the session ID to a known value. This could lead to unauthorized access to the application and the ability to perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The document does not specify the exact attack vector. However, session fixation vulnerabilities are typically exploited by tricking a user into using a session ID controlled by the attacker. This could be achieved through techniques like:
    *   Sending a crafted link to the user that includes a specific session ID.
    *   Using a malicious script to modify the session ID used by the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the session ID used by the victim.
*   The attacker does not need prior access to the system.
*   The attacker needs to trick the victim to use the session ID they control.
