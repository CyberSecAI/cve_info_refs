- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper output neutralization for logs, specifically newline injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The MongoDB server does not properly sanitize or neutralize newline characters within log messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject newline characters into log entries, which can lead to artificial log entries or the splitting of existing log entries. This allows log spoofing, which may hide malicious activities or provide false information.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted commands to the MongoDB server with newline characters embedded in the message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N - no privileges required). The attack can be performed over the network (AV:N).
