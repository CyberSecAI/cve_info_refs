- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially make requests to internal resources that are not normally accessible.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data or internal systems.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in WebSphere Application Server and allows an attacker to send crafted requests to the server which could then be used to make internal requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable WebSphere Application Server.
