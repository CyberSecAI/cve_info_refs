Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-20120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The administration web interface of the Arris SurfBoard SB8200 lacks proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF protections within the web interface. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that the user's browser will unknowingly submit to the vulnerable device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make unauthorized changes to the device's configuration.
*   **Administrative Password Change:** Specifically mentioned is the ability for an attacker to change the administrative password, thus locking out the legitimate user.
*   **Full Control:** By changing the password, the attacker can gain full control over the device's settings, which could lead to more severe consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The attacker crafts a malicious web page or uses other methods to trick the user's browser into sending unauthorized requests to the Arris SurfBoard device.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user who is logged into the modem's admin panel to visit the attacker's malicious website or click on a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Device:** The attacker needs to be aware of the Arris SurfBoard SB8200's vulnerability and its specific API endpoints.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious webpage or utilize some other form of social engineering to deliver a malicious link.
*   **Target User Access:** The target user needs to be logged into the web interface of the vulnerable device and be within the local network of the device.
*   **No special privileges**: The attacker does not require any elevated privileges on the victim's computer or the target network.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can force a password change on the admin user.
*   The affected product is the Arris SurfBoard SB8200 with firmware version `AB01.02.053.01_112320_193.0A.NSH`.
