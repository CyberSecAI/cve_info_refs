Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20789:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation of URL redirection within the GroupSession software.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:** The software is susceptible to an open redirect vulnerability. This means that a specially crafted URL can cause the application to redirect the user to an arbitrary external website, which could be malicious.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the following:
    *   **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to fake login pages or other malicious websites that mimic legitimate services. This can allow the attacker to steal user credentials or sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
   *   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
   *   An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that will be used to redirect victims to a malicious site.
   *   User interaction is required to trigger the redirect (UI:R). The victim needs to click the malicious URL.
   
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   *   The attacker does not need to have an account on the affected GroupSession system.
   *   The attacker needs to be able to entice the user to click on the maliciously crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided information from both `groupsession.jp` and `jvn.jp` clearly identifies the open redirect vulnerability as one of several in GroupSession.
* JVN (Japan Vulnerability Notes) also provides a CVSS score for the vulnerability (4.7 for CVSS v3, and 2.6 for CVSS v2).
