Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-20864:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to improper access control that leads to unauthorized activation of the telnet service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Improper Access Control:** The device fails to properly restrict access to the telnet service activation, allowing unauthorized activation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A network-adjacent attacker can enable the telnet service without authentication.
*   Once enabled, the attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-adjacent:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable router.
*   No prior authentication or privileges are needed.

**Affected Products:**
The following ELECOM router models are affected:
