Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-20870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of exceptional conditions, specifically when a scan transmission is interrupted by a network error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-755):** The device does not properly manage the state of the scanned data when a network error occurs during transmission. It appears the data is temporarily stored on the HDD/SSD and not immediately purged.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A physically present attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive scanned image data by removing the HDD/SSD from the device before the scan job times out.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable Konica Minolta printer to remove the storage medium.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the printer.
- **No Privileges Needed:** No specific user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker must wait for a scan job to be interrupted by a network error and then remove the HDD/SSD before the job times out.
- **Technical Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to know how to physically access and remove the HDD/SSD from the printer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor recommends using the standard HDD/SSD encryption feature as a solution, but this requires formatting the storage and erasing existing data.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" in terms of confidentiality impact, but has "Low" ratings for integrity and availability.
- The attack is considered complex due to the specific timing and physical access requirements.
