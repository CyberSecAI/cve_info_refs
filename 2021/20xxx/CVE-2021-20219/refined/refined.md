Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20219:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `n_tty_receive_char_special` function within `drivers/tty/n_tty.c` of the Linux kernel.
- The issue is related to improper synchronization in the `flush_to_ldisc()` function. Specifically, a missing sanity check and a changing `ldata->read_head` allow a loop to be delayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Synchronization:** Lack of proper synchronization in the `flush_to_ldisc` function.
- **Missing Sanity Check:** The code lacks a sanity check which, combined with changing `ldata->read_head`, causes the delay.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can exploit this flaw to delay a loop in the kernel, causing a threat to the system's availability, effectively resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Normal User Privilege:** The attacker only needs normal user privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system with normal user privileges.

**Additional Information:**
- The bug report mentions that a fix was included in kernel version 4.18, indicating the vulnerability affects earlier versions.
- There was no mitigation available at the time the bug was reported.
- Evgenii Shatokhin (Virtuozzo Research LLC) is credited with discovering the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported on 2021-02-01 and the bug report was last modified on 2024-11-02.
