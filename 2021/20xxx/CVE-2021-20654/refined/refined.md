Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20654:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically within the handling of uploaded SVG files. When an SVG file containing JavaScript is attached to a card and accessed without the "download" parameter in the URL, the browser treats it inline and executes the embedded JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The primary vulnerability is stored XSS (CWE-79). Malicious JavaScript code can be embedded within an SVG file, stored on the server, and then executed within a user's browser when they access the file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The application doesn't sanitize or properly handle SVG files, allowing the execution of embedded scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality**: Attackers can steal sensitive information like session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Integrity**: Attackers can modify page content, enabling phishing attacks.
*  **Availability**: Although not mentioned as the primary impact, the report indicates that other XSS attacks could lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network (AV:N)**: The attack occurs over the network.
*   **Attachment Upload**: An attacker uploads a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript as an attachment to a card.
*   **URL Manipulation**: The attacker lures a victim to a URL of the uploaded attachment without the "download" parameter, triggering the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User (PR:L)**: The attacker must be a logged-in user of Wekan.
*   **User Interaction (UI:R)**: The victim must click on the crafted URL without the download parameter for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a series of XSS vulnerabilities called "Fieldbleed" affecting Wekan.
*   The issue was initially reported for input fields, then for iFrame XSS, and finally, for SVG attachment XSS.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Wekan version 4.12.
*   The vulnerability is not considered highly critical but can still be used to steal user information or conduct phishing attacks.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ryoya Koyama at Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
