*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of TeX content when the TeX notation filter is enabled in Moodle.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into Moodle through TeX notation, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the content.
