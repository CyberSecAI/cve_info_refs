Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20651:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The provided content from `jvn.jp` and `elecom.co.jp` directly relate to CVE-2021-20651. The JVN entry explicitly mentions CVE-2021-20651. The elecom.co.jp content lists this CVE as the JVN id: JVN#98115035.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the processing of filenames when extracting compressed files within the "ELECOM File Manager" Android application. This leads to a directory traversal vulnerability.

*   **Weakness:**
    *   **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate filenames in compressed archives, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to write files to arbitrary locations within the application's accessible directory structure.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A remote attacker can create arbitrary files or overwrite existing files in directories accessible by the application.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is remote. The attacker would need to provide a crafted compressed archive to the vulnerable application.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious archive to the "ELECOM File Manager" application. No special privileges on the device is required for this exploit, but the user does need to open the crafted file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The official JVN entry provides CVSS v3 and v2 scores.
*   The vendor (ELECOM) has acknowledged the vulnerability and recommends users stop using the vulnerable application. They also suggest switching to their successor app, "ELECOM EXtorage Link".
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ryohei Koike to IPA.
