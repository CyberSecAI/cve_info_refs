Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-20606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125). The software attempts to read data from a memory location outside of the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The software does not properly validate the boundaries of data it reads when processing project files, leading to out-of-bounds read condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit may lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The software may crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted malicious project file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious project file.
- The attacker needs to get the victim to open the malicious file with the vulnerable software.
- User interaction is required as the user needs to open the malicious project file.
- No special privileges are required, as the user opening the file is enough to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network or host as the victim; the malicious project file can be delivered through untrusted sources like email attachments.
