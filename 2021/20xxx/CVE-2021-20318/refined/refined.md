Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-20318:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The HornetQ component within the Artemis library in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 7 was not updated with the fix for CVE-2016-4978. This means a previously identified vulnerability remained unpatched in a newer version of the software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Patching:** The primary weakness is the failure to apply the fix for CVE-2016-4978 to the HornetQ component in EAP 7.
*   **Object Deserialization Vulnerability:**  The underlying issue appears to be related to the insecure deserialization of Java objects received via JMS ObjectMessage. This vulnerability is not explicitly detailed here, but it is referenced as CVE-2016-4978.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. The code would execute with the permissions of the application using the vulnerable JMS ObjectMessage functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JMS ObjectMessage:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted JMS ObjectMessage to a vulnerable application using the HornetQ component.
*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can exploit this remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send JMS messages to a system running a vulnerable instance of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.
*   The attacker does not appear to need any special privileges or to be on the same network as the target.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was fixed in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7, Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8 and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (general) through errata RHSA-2022:0400, RHSA-2022:0401, and RHSA-2022:0404 respectively.
*   The provided content does not offer specific technical details about the deserialization vulnerability itself, this would need to be checked against CVE-2016-4978.
