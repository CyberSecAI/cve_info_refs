It works great and from my research no free membership plugin even comes close.
My only reservation is that the Pro version is super-expensive. I would gladly pay a modest price for a additional few options that I want, but the bundle is out of my budget.

Perhaps one of the most frustrating pieces of software I’ve dealt with. They continually change / “upgrade” the plug-in without consideration for existing users who may not be as technical as their developers. A case in point is a relatively recent change to the Edit User pages. What was once a simple edit/update membership details, e.g. membership level, now requires navigation through multiple windows with no clear indication of what to do

This plugin is not compatible with buddypress or the theme compatible with buddypress!
After installing this plugin and setting it up after a free account = 0 dollars, the website became unavailable other than a page with info about paid membership or free membership.
No matter what I clicked on the menu on the website, it was locked to this page! Just had to uninstall the plugin to get access to my websites again. Now i looking for other solutions that could possibly be compatible!

Paid Memberships Pro is an outstanding plugin with some of the best support I’ve experienced. I’ve used several membership plugins and without doubt the value of PMPro is the best. The code base is regularly updated, there are numerous available add-ons and custom code recipes to find and use for various purposes, and the customer support is truly exceptional. The people behind PMPro are engaged with their community and make themselves available regularly for feedback and are receptive to customer ideas for ways to enhance the functionality of the plugin. I was hesitant to pay for this plugin at first given my experience with some other paid plugins, but I’m finding the cost is a very good value and that I’m saving time and money over having to find my own ways to accomplish my goals.
