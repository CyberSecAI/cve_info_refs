Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20674:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The MagicConnect Client program installer insecurely loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). This is due to the installer not specifying the full path for required DLLs, which leads to it searching the current working directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DLL Hijacking (CWE-427):** The installer is vulnerable to DLL hijacking or planting. It loads DLLs from the same directory where it resides, without proper validation of the DLLâ€™s origin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL with the same name as one expected by the installer in the same directory. When the installer runs, it loads the attacker's DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user who launched the installer.
- **Privilege escalation:** If a user with elevated privileges executes the installer, the attacker's code will also run with those elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs to place the malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **File write access:** The attacker needs the ability to write files in the directory where the installer is located or executed from.
- **User Interaction:**  The user needs to be tricked into running the installer. The user also has to be using remote desktop to connect when this occurs.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the installer of the MagicConnect Client program.
- The vulnerability is present in installers downloaded before March 1, 2021.
- The vendor released an updated installer to address the vulnerability.
- Users who downloaded the installer before March 1, 2021, are advised to download the latest installer.
- Users who have already installed the software are not affected as the vulnerability only impacts the installer.
- The provided JVN link includes the following CVSS v3 score:
    - 7.0 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    - This indicates a local attack vector, high impact for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  It also indicates a high attack complexity and user interaction required.
- The analysis notes that the user has to be tricked into placing a malicious DLL into the directory where the installer is located
