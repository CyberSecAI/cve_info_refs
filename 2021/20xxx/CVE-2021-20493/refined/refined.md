Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20493:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is present in IBM Cognos Analytics, specifically within the Bootstrap library it uses. It stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the `data-target` property of scrollspy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is an XSS vulnerability. By exploiting the lack of input validation, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary script within the victim's browser. This script runs in the security context of the website, potentially leading to further attacks.
- **Cookie Theft:** A common use for this type of XSS vulnerability is to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials. This would allow an attacker to impersonate the user.
- **Data disclosure or modification** the NetApp advisory states that exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires some form of user interaction (UI:R) to trigger. The user would have to interact with a page containing the injected malicious script.
- **Exploitable via user-supplied input:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious script via the `data-target` property.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N)
- **Remote Attacker:** A remote attacker can initiate the attack.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is described as having a medium severity score of 6.1. The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`
- The vulnerability is present in IBM Cognos Analytics versions 11.1.7 and 11.2.0
- NetApp products that incorporate IBM Cognos Analytics are impacted. Specifically, the NetApp document lists "OnCommand Insight" as an affected product, with a fix available in version 7.3.13.
- The IBM document mentions that the vulnerability is addressed in IBM Cognos Analytics 11.1.7 Fix Pack 4 and IBM Cognos Analytics 11.2.1.

In summary, CVE-2021-20493 is an XSS vulnerability in IBM Cognos Analytics' Bootstrap library. By crafting malicious input, attackers can inject scripts into web pages, potentially leading to cookie theft and other attacks.
