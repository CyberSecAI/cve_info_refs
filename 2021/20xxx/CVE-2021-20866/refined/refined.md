Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20866:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The JVN (Japan Vulnerability Notes) document explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-20866" and its description as a "Missing authorization related to user list obtaining" vulnerability within the "Advanced Custom Fields" WordPress plugin. Therefore, the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **missing authorization check** within the plugin. This means that the plugin fails to properly verify if a user has the necessary permissions before allowing them to access certain information, specifically a list of users.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms, which allows unauthorized users to obtain user list.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with a low-level WordPress account (e.g., Subscriber, Contributor, Author) can obtain a list of user information without the necessary permissions. This information could potentially be used in further attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, using HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with low privileges.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid WordPress account, even with a low-level role such as Subscriber, Contributor or Author.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress website running the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Notes**

*   The JVN document also mentions two other closely related vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-20865 and CVE-2021-20867) in the same plugin, which involve missing authorization related to database browsing and field group movement, respectively. This highlights a broader issue with authorization controls in the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Advanced Custom Fields versions 5.11 and later.
