So I would say the vulnerability is present in keycloak version 11.0.1 but in a tech preview feature and also need to be explicitly enabled by adding some system properties at starting up the server. This would make it a Low impact Vulnerability.  This issue has been fixed in keycloak version 12.0.3 via the below PR <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-prod/pull/421>  Note : This Pull Request is for internal repo so you would need access for keycloak-prod to see the PR.  Hope this helps!  -Param   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1924606#c12)  ajaiswal595    2021-03-11 07:07:58 UTC  ``` Thanks, Param for your response,  How would I get access to the PR <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-prod/pull/421> ?  If any lead would be great.   Regards  -Ajay   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1924606#c13)  ajaiswal595    2021-04-06 13:24:48 UTC  ``` How to enable new account console feature in Keycloak 11.0.1 which is tech preview feature.

Use these below system properties while starting the keycloak server :  -Dkeycloak.profile.feature.account_api=enabled -Dkeycloak.profile.feature.account2=enabled  and choose "preview" account console theme from the admin console Themes tab.   ``` |  |
