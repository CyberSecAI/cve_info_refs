Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper restriction of XML external entity reference (XXE) vulnerability. The software does not properly handle specially crafted XML files during document conversion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is that the software is susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This is due to the software processing external entities in untrusted XML documents, which leads to other security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Massive Access to Other Servers:** By exploiting the XXE vulnerability using a specially crafted XML document, an attacker can cause the server to initiate a large number of connections to other servers. This can lead to denial of service (DoS) conditions on those other servers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based. An attacker can send a specially crafted Office document containing malicious XML to the vulnerable server.
- **Specially Crafted XML:** The attack vector relies on using maliciously crafted XML data embedded within an Office document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require any authentication or special access to the server.
- **Ability to send requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send requests with specially crafted office documents to the vulnerable server.
