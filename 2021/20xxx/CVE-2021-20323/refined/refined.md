{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The clients-registrations endpoint in Keycloak allows execution of javascript code on the client-side due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in POST requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically a POST-based reflected XSS.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary javascript code in the context of a victim's browser when they access the vulnerable Keycloak endpoint. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, and other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is initiated by sending a specially crafted POST request to the clients-registrations endpoint of Keycloak. This payload is then reflected back to the user, causing the malicious script to execute in their browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious POST request and convince a victim to trigger the request. This could involve social engineering tactics or other methods of delivering the crafted request. The attacker needs no prior authentication."
