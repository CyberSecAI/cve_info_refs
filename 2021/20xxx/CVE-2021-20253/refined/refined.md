Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a "Job Isolation" escape in Ansible Tower. The default installation allows a low-privileged user to elevate their privileges to the `awx` user. This occurs because of a flaw that allows a user to escape the isolated environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Job Isolation Escape: The core issue is that the job isolation mechanism in Ansible Tower is not properly implemented, allowing users to break out of the intended security boundary.
- Privilege Escalation: A low-privileged user can gain elevated privileges to the `awx` user, which is a high-privileged account in Ansible Tower.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Confidentiality and Integrity: An attacker could potentially access and modify sensitive data managed by Ansible Tower, compromising the confidentiality and integrity.
- System Availability: The attacker could disrupt the normal operation of Ansible Tower, potentially causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed both from within and outside the isolated environment.
- A low-privileged user needs to be able to read and write to the project environment to perform the exploit.
- The attacker needs to execute commands from inside the isolated environment to elevate privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low-privileged user access to Ansible Tower.
- Ability to read and write the project environment, specifically from inside the isolated environment.
- Knowledge of the specific commands and steps necessary to exploit the Job Isolation escape.
- Ability to interact with the isolated environment

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects default installations of Ansible Tower.
- Red Hat's justification for the CVSS score suggests that user interaction (UI:R) is required and the attack vector is local (AV:L). Also, the attack complexity is high (AC:H).
- The vulnerability is fixed in ansible-tower versions 3.8.2, 3.7.5, and 3.6.7.
- There is no known mitigation other than upgrading to fixed versions of the product.
