These instructions use the following terms to refer to directories used during installation:

<JazzSM\_HOME> Refers to the directory where Jazz for Service Management is installed.

      Examples:

      /opt/IBM/JazzSM on UNIX systems.

      C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM on Windows systems.

<DASH\_HOME> Refers to the directory where the user interface  of Jazz for Service Management is installed.

     Examples (on UNIX systems):

     <JazzSM\_HOME>/ui on UNIX systems.

<OMNIBUS\_WEBGUI> Refers to the directory where Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI 8.1 is installed.

     Examples:

     /opt/IBM/netcool/omnibus\_webgui on UNIX systems.

     C:\IBM\netcool/omnibus\_webgui on Windows systems.

<FP\_dir> Refers to the temporary directory where you extract the contents of the fix pack's archive.

<REPOSITORY\_GA> Refers to the repository of Web GUI 8.1.

<REPOSITORY\_SUBDIR> Refers to OMNIbusWebGUIRepository (base) or OMNIbusWebGUI\_NOIExtensionsRepository (NOI extension)

<REPOSITORY\_FP> Refers to the "composite" or "delta and serviceDelta" repositories of this fix pack.

    Examples (on UNIX systems):

    either

    (i)

     For base product, <FP\_dir>/<REPOSITORY\_SUBDIR>/composite/repository.config

    or

    (ii)

     <FP\_dir>/<REPOSITORY\_SUBDIR>/delta/repository.config

     <FP\_dir>/<REPOSITORY\_SUBDIR>/serviceDelta/repository.config

1.2 Installing this fix pack:

-------------------------------------

The media (zip) file of this fix pack includes the update pack and the tools for Linux & AIX only. These packages can be downloaded and extract to <FP\_dir>.

Note: If the current installation of Web GUI V8.1 is the June 2014 GA version (build 493), you must uninstall Web GUI and install the September 2014 GA version (build 615) before applying this fix pack, or use the refresh/full installer of V8.1.0 FP4. To check what version is currently installed click Troubleshooting and Support > System Information for Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI. For instance, the September 2014 GA version has the following information displayed:

    "IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus V8.1 Web GUI build 615 (15:31 Sep 29 2014)".

Scenario a)

   Install Web GUI 8.1 (build 615 - Sep 29 2014 version) together with this fix pack.

   Or similarly, Install Web GUI 8.1.0.4 (8.1.0.14 or 8.1.0.16) full installer version together with this fix pack

   The update pack can be used with the 8.1 installation media to create a new installation.

   For instance, use Installation Manager to configure the "Preference", to add and select both <REPOSITORY\_GA> and <REPOSITORY\_FP> repositories, and then click "Install".

Scenario b)

   Update an existing Web GUI 8.1.0.x installation to this Fix Pack. Or similarly, Update an existing Web GUI 8.1.0.x installation to this Fix Pack.

   The update pack can be used to update an existing installation for customers with the installed Web GUI 8.1.0.x

   For instance, use Installation Manager to configure the "Preference" to add and select only <REPOSITORY\_FP> repositories, and then click "Update".

Scenario c)

   Update an existing Web GUI 8.1 (build 493 - June 2014 version) installation to this Fix Pack.

   The update pack cannot be used to update an existing installation for customers with the installed June 2014 GA version (build 493) of Web GUI 8.1. You must uninstall Web GUI and install the September 2014 GA version (build 615) before applying this fix pack.

   Complete the following steps:

   Note: Do not remove/uninstall JazzSM during this process.

   1. Use the provided tools to create preservation zip files on Linux/AIX.

   The tool (e.g. <FP\_dir>/tools/backupGA.sh) provided in Linux and AIX fix packs can be used to create the temporary files (e.g. <JazzSM>/ui/temp/\*.zip), before an immediate re-install of Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI. The configuration and data will be preserved when the current version of Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI is uninstalled, and automatically restored after the next installation of Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI.

   This tool must be executed by the user who installed Web GUI 8.1. It is specifically designed and supported for customers with the June 2014 GA version (build 493) of Web GUI 8.1 on Linux/AIX platforms only, in order to update to the September 2014 GA version (build 615) of Web GUI 8.1 or to this Fix Pack.

   Run the following command to execute this tool:

   <FP\_dir>/tools/backupGA.sh -dash <DASH\_HOME> -webgui<OMNIBUS\_WEBGUI>

   For example, with the default install directories on a Linux/AIX system:

   <FP\_dir>/tools/backupGA.sh -dash /opt/IBM/JazzSM/ui -webgui /opt/IBM/netcool/omnibus\_webgui

   2. Manual backup of Web GUI 8.1 June 2014 GA version (build 493), see section (4).
   3. Uninstall Web GUI 8.1 June 2014 GA version (build 493), see section (7).

   4. Complete the steps in section (2) or as outlined in section 1.2 scenario (a).

Addition notes:

---------------

    - A roll back to previous versions will be available if the "update" facility was used, rather than "install" from the Installation Manager.

    - In GUI mode, the launch page to Post-installation configuration tool will not be available for an update, but is available for a new install.

    - If the steps in section 1.2 scenario c) are not followed when updating an existing Web GUI 8.1 June 2014 GA version (build 493) installation to this Fix Pack, a failed installation will result. To recover perform one of the following steps:

        (a) manual restore, see section (5)

        (b) uninstall the Web GUI, see section (7)

2. Update an existing Web GUI 8.1 installation to Web GUI 8.1 Fix Pack

======================================================================

The update of the existing Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI, includes the in-place upgrade that would preserve the current configuration and data. In case of an issue occurred that cannot be resolved, a manual restore back to a pre-fix pack state may be needed, see section (5), thus a manual backup is strongly recommended for this purpose, see section (4).

After the update installation over an existing installation, there won't be a launch page to execute the post-installation configuration tool. This is working as designed because the configuration is not required and already preserved.

After a successful update installation, a roll back to a previous Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI version will be supported, where the current configuration and data will be preserved. Note: This is not necessarily the same as the data in pre-fix pack state.

2.1 Before you begin

--------------------
1. Extract all the files from the OMNIbus-v8.1.0-WebGUI-FP<number>-IM-<platform>-UpdatePack.zip archive into a temporary directory (the <FP\_dir> directory).
    o <number> is a code for the fix pack number.

    o <platform> is a code for the operating system of the machine where you are installing the fix pack.
2. Please backup the existing version before installing this fix pack, see section (4)

2.2 Updating using the GUI

3. Installing IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI 8.1 FP in a load balancing environment

=======================================================================================

For instructions on updating to a V8.1 fix pack in a load balancing environment please see the following topic in the Netcool/OMNIbus Knowledge Center:

http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ\_8.1.0/com.ibm.netcool\_OMNIbus.doc\_8.1.0/webtop/wip/task/web\_upg\_dash\_ha.html

Note: You will get a message "cluster is in maintenance mode", after you update Web GUI in HA without disjoining it from the cluster and then try to update pages, filters, views etc, where different levels of WebGUI version exist on nodes in the same HA (DB2). Fixed in DASH 3.1.3.4 or later, if WEBGUI is upgraded then customer have to run below command at least on one node and then WAS profile restart should be required on all nodes.

     (i) Go to JazzSM/ui/bin/ directory

     (ii) Run consolecli.sh|bat ForceHAUpdate --username console\_admin\_user\_ID --password console\_admin\_password

     https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEKCU\_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/tip\_original/ctip\_config\_ha\_diag.html

4. Recommended backup procedure of the current Web GUI install, a pre-fix pack state

====================================================================================

Before you begin

=================
Complete a backup of the Installation Manager. To complete the Installation Manager backup, complete the steps that are detailed in the Backing up and restoring Installation Manager topic within the IBM Knowledge Center for Installation Manager. See https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSDV2W/im\_family\_welcome.html

Important: The paths referenced in these steps are for a default install. Ensure the correct paths are used for the Web GUI instance being backed up.

1. Ensure that all users are logged out of the Web GUI.

2. Stop the WebSphere Application Server.

3. Back up the existing installation:

    o For UNIX operating systems

      Use a suitable archive utility to compress the content of the following directories and copy to a secure place:

       \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

       |  Directory                           |  Backup filename     |

       |-------------------------------------------------------------|

       |  /opt/IBM/netcool/omnibus\_webgui     |  omnibus\_webgui.tar  |

       |  /opt/IBM/JazzSM                     |  JazzSM.tar          |

       |  /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer        |  AppServer.tar       |

       |-------------------------------------------------------------|

    o For Windows operating systems

      Use a suitable archive utility to compress the content of the following directories and copy to a secure place:

       \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

       |  Directory                                       |  Backup filename     |

       |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

       |  C:\IBM\netcool\omnibus\_webgui                   |  omnibus\_webgui.zip  |

       |  C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM                     |  JazzSM.zip          |

       |  C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer  |  AppServer.zip       |

       |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

5. Restoring a Web GUI install after applying this fix pack, to a pre-fix pack state

====================================================================================

This method can be used if the roll-back process fails. This would roll back to a pre-fix pack state, the backed-up instance as created by follow the instruction in section (4).

1. Stop the Websphere Application Server.
2. Rename the Web GUI, JazzSM and Websphere Application Server directories as follows:

    Example:

    o On UNIX and Linux:

        mv /opt/IBM/netcool/omnibus\_webgui /opt/IBM/netcool/omnibus\_webgui.old

        mv /opt/IBM/JazzSM /opt/IBM/JazzSM.old

        mv /opt/IBM/WebSphere /opt/IBM/WebSphere.old
   o On Windows:

        rename C:\IBM\netcool\omnibus\_webgui C:\IBM\netcool\omnibus\_webgui.old

        rename C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM C:\IBM\JazzSM.old

        rename C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere C:\IBM\WebSphere.old
3. Use a suitable archive utility to restore the content of the following files to their original locations:
    o On UNIX and Linux:

        omnibus\_webgui.tar

        JazzSM.tar

        AppServer.tar
    o On Windows:

        omnibus\_webgui.zip

        JazzSM.zip

        AppServer.zip
4. Start the WebSphere Application Server.

6. Rolling back using Installation Manager

==========================================

This method can be used if the fix pack was installed by using the "update" facility provided by Installation Manager. This would roll back to the previous Web GUI version with current configuration and data preserved.

Note: If the previous WAS-SDK (v7.0.x, v7.1.x, or v8.0.x) is used and removed, then it must be reinstalled before perform any rollback.

1. Change to the "eclipse" sub-directory of the Installation Manager installation directory and use the following command to start Installation Manager:
   o UNIX / Linux: ./IBMIM

   o Windows: IBMIM.exe
2. Select "Roll Back" from the main menu.
3. Select the package group within which you installed the Web GUI and click "Next".
4. Select the version of the package to roll back to.
5. Read the summary information and click "Roll Back" to roll back the package.

7. Uninstall Web GUI

Short Description: ADDITION OF A NEW DYNAMIC WATCH LISTS ENHANCEMENT
Summary:

There should be a way to easily move alerts into a temporary filter directly from the event viewer. This should support the following features:
1. Creating watch list filters based on existing alerts (i.e. based on node, alert group, summary) which include all future alerts of a similar form.

2. Display of all accessible watch list filters on a dynamically generated map.

3. Ability to delete watch lists from the event viewer.

4. Ability to create watch lists on a user or group level.

5. Ability to set an expire time for watch list filters.
This enhancement request originates from an RFE submitted to http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rfe/execute?use\_case=viewRfe&CR\_ID=25368

Short Description: WEBGUI TABLEVIEW SMARTPAGE COMMAND DOES NOT USE THE DATASOURCE PARAMETER
Summary:

When a smartpage is created using the TABLEVIEW command the parameter to specify the datasource is ignored.

If there are multiple datasources the default datasource is used and changing this setting does not change the used datasource. If the default datasource is NCOMS and there is a datasource called RSCOMS the following will not use this datasource, while this is what should happen and is desired.
<!-- insert:TABLEVIEW[filtername="AllEvents",filtertype="global",datasource="RSCOMS",maxrows="2"] -->

alm00307650 / IV59986

.....................

Short Description: TRANSIENT FILTERS NOT HANDLING INTERNATIONAL CHARACTERS WHEN USING INTERNET EXPLORER
Summary:

When an AEL is launched with a transient filter (not pre-defined in the Filter Builder) using the IE browser, any international characters in the string will not be handled/matched. This could be seen, for example, by creating a Javascript tool that launches a new TIP page containing an AEL and specifies a filter that the AEL should load.

alm00309393 / IV61617

.....................

Short Description: WEB GUI DATA PROVIDER SHOULD HIDE UNSUPPORTED TOOL TYPES
Summary:

In the Web GUI (CURI) data provider, all "events" datasets contains task definitions, which results in a right-click menu appearing when the dataset is populating a TWL widget in DASH, such as a table widget. The right-click menu represents the Web GUI "alerts" menu.
However, TWL table widgets do not support all the different tool types which Web GUI Event Viewer supports. Examples of tools which will not work in a TWL widget are command tools, and prompted tools. Such tasks should be removed from the menu so that they are not available, unless using Event Viewer.

alm00309395 / IV61622

.....................

Short Description: UNABLE TO DISPLAY GAUGE WITH WEIGHTED AVERAGE METRICS

9.1 Enhancements

----------------
alm00315484 / IV70437

.....................

Short Description: NEW EVENT VIEWER CAPABILITY IN WEB GUI BASE OFFERING
Summary:

The Event Viewer has been enhanced to provide the following features:
- Ability to integrate and display events from multiple data sources.

- Operators may now apply any of their views using a selector on the toolbar.

- Operators may edit the applied filter and view in situation using new options on the toolbar and menubar.

- Improved selection support to allow information and journals to be viewed concurrently for all selected events. All selected rows may now be copied to the system clipboard.

- Ability to execute custom tools by clicking a row in the event viewer.

- Ability to configure a transient filter in the portlet preferences.

- A new menu bar option to provide access to commonly used features and custom tools.

- Information and journal windows retain their size and position when closed and re-opened.

- Column heading alignment is now based on the view configuration.

- Reduced latency via an improved refresh algorithm so that only new and changed events are requested from the ObjectServer rather then the entire data set.

alm00315463 / IV70427

.....................

Short Description: NEW EVENT ANALYTICS CAPABILITY IN WEB GUI EXTENSION OFFERING
Summary:

Netcool Operations Insight Extensions for IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI has been enhanced to add an analytical capability to be able to identify correlated events and group them as parent-child in the Event Viewer.
Related Event Analytics uses statistical analysis of IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus historical event data to determine which events have a statistical tendency to occur together. The results of this analysis are output on a scheduled basis as event groups. You can use the related events UI to analyze these event groups. Validated event groups can be deployed with a single click as Netcool/Impact correlation rules, without the need to write any code. Correlation rules that are generated in this way act on real-time event data to show a single synthetic event for the events in the event group. All events in the group are presented as children of this synthetic event, with that decreasing the number of events that are presented to your operations staff in the Event Viewer.

Short Description: WEBGUI731 : AEL DOES NOT RESPOND TO TIP FAILOVER AS EXPECTED
Summary:

The AEL client did not recognise the TIP server failover when configured in a high-availability configuration.
Sometimes the client would recognise the failover, but usually it would not, and the whole interface was stalled until the session timeout of 30 minutes was reached

alm00294671 / IV41869

.....................

Short Description: PREUPGRADE.SH PICKS UP BACKUP DIRECTORIES AND FILES
Summary:

The preupgrade.sh script is picking up backup files and directories not actually in live use by WebGUI and exporting them to upgradeData.zip. This is increasing the likelihood that the upgradeData.zip will be much larger than necessary, which can in turn lead to problems when running upgrade.sh to import the data

alm00297157 / IV45221

.....................

Short Description: COLUMN NAMES IN AEL ARE NOT TRANSLATED
Summary:

Column names in AEL are not translated to other languages. This is because the columnheadings files of all languages have only english and there are no translations to respective languages in those files.

Summary:

Opening AEL using unregistered or non existing filter will result "Filter 'TestFilter' of category '{1}' not found." error (as per designed). However the 2nd parameter ('{1}') was not resolved to display category of the filter. The reason is the current message formatting doesn't not support formatted message with more than one parameters.

alm00311692 / IV64503

.....................

Short Description: NOT POSSIBLE TO LOAD A NEW EVENT DASHBOARD WITHOUT ALL GLOBAL FILTERS
Summary:

Event Dashboard is having performance issue when loading big number of filters (e.g. more then 700 filters) depend on clients environment capability. The Event Dashboard seems hang and the CPU usage is continuously high. While RFE 55292 have been submitted to get higher performance Event Dashboard, there is no easy workaround for existing user that already have huge number of filters to configure the newly created Event Dashboard to load filters lower than recommended number(i.e. 700 filters).
Note, the newly created Event Dashboard will load all global filters,hence caused user not able to proceed to edit mode.

alm00311970 / IV64825

.....................

Short Description: ALARMS ARE NOT ABLE TO SHOW IN EVENT VIEWER IF THE VALUE OF A FIELD HAS CHINESE CHARACTERS
Summary:

Initiating an EventViewer request whose condition contains non-ASCII characters will not display any result even if the condition should match a set of events.
For instance, when the location for a subset of events is in Chinese and those events are grouped by location, clicking on the location in the left pane of the EventViewer will not display any event ("no events found" in the right pane), where it actually should.

Short Description: CREATEORREPLACECGI ADDS FULL CGI FILE PATHWAY TO THE CGI REGISTRY INSTEAD OF JUST THE FILE NAME
Summary:

Modifying an existing CGI script through WAAPI while referencing it with an absolute path will cause subsequent attempts to execute the CGI script to fail with a "file not found" error message.

alm00313667 / IV67094

.....................

Short Description: COLUMNS NOT IN THE DATASET FOR WIDGETS
Summary:

Web GUI view. However, this can happen if the user configures a DASH table widget based on a particular Web GUI view, and then later on removes a column from the view. In this instance, the DASH widget continues to request information for the now-missing column.
This results in Web GUI throwing an exception, resulting in many stack traces in the DASH/TIP log file - potentially hundreds per minute, depending on how much data is in the dataset, for which the widget requires data.
If there are thousands as there can be then there is a slim chance of a performance degradation.

alm00313639 / IV67079

alm00313896 /IV67435

.....................

Short Description: INEFFICIENCIES IN DATASOURCE CONNECTION POOL WORKFLOW
Summary:

Inefficiencies in the workflow of the datasource thread connection pool are leading to hung threads when WebGUI issues a sustained high number of queries to the object server.
Two issues have been identified:

  1)  The retry logic. Threads are trying twice to make a connection to the datasource primary before failing over.  The second try is doubling the waiting time and is unnecessary.

  2)  Synchronisation. Closed connections to the object server are sometimes neither being returned to the connection pool nor passed to waiting queries.

Short Description: NEW ENHANCEMENTS TO EVENT ANALYTICS CAPABILITY IN WEB GUI EXTENSION OFFERING
Summary:

Netcool Operations Insight Extensions for IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI has been enhanced to provide 3 main features.

- Single UI for configuring Seasonal and Related Event Configurations until previous release the user would have to create 2 separate configurations for seasonality and related events. This Fix Pack merges the 2 UIs and hence it, making it possible to create both configurations from a single UI. This provides simplicity and consistency.
- Integration between Seasonal and Related Events. This feature provides a way of viewing whether the seasonal  event does have a related event associated with it.
- Define set of automated actions when the seasonal/related events occur in the live environment.This feature provides a capability to create a rule to take some predefined actions when the seasonal event occurs in the live environment. Additionally, it is also possible to drill into the historical events behind the seasonal event, which is very useful for investigation purposes.

.....................

Short Description: NEW EVENTS PATTERN ENHANCEMENTS TO EVENT ANALYTICS CAPABILITY IN WEB GUI EXTENSION OFFERING
Summary:

Netcool Operations Insight Extensions for IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI has been enhanced to provide the "Events Pattern" feature. "Events Pattern" provides more sophisticated grouping capability than the "Related Events" alone. A pattern describes a set of events that are related (they always occur together), but is not specific to the resource (server, interface etc) that the events occur on. Below are the benefits of using an "Event Pattern":

 - Provides grouping of events based on the event type on multiple resources

 - Less patterns to manage since it can cover multiple discovered groups

 - Can be used to group under most important event in the Event Viewer

Short Description: AEL DISPLAY OCCASIONALLY TURNS GREY
Summary:

When the applet is initialized with a transient filter, a new event data refresh thread is spawned as part of the update of the filter drop down. Usually. this takes longer to complete than the rest of the applet initialization, but under certain conditions it does not. Under this condition, the internal list of sort columns does not get updated until the next refresh, which causes a disconnect between the incoming data and the column names.
The visible result is that the event list will appear grey and double clicking an alert with either:

  1. Open the details for a different alert which has a serial matching the severity of the original

  2. Give an error (if there are no alerts with a serial matching the severity of the original)

Short Description: ERRORS DURING VIEW AND FILTER PERSISTENCE PREVENT CLOSING VIEWBOX/FILTERBOX TAGS TO BE WRITTEN TO FILE
Summary:

Corrupted request payloads sent by the View builder form through the back-end are detected, but persistence of the corrupted view is not prevented. In turn, this can lead to Web GUI persisting malformed XML representing views in the local file system.

Short Description: DEPENDENTCY FILTER DIDN'T DISPLAY IN THE DEPENDENT FILTER
Summary:

In certain cases (e.g. importing dependent filters from a Web GUI to another), the order of persistence between a dependent filter and its dependencies does not allow to resolve the dependencies for that dependent filter, as the dependencies are persisted after the dependent filter. This causes a failure at de-serialization, where the dependencies cannot be resolved. Both the dependent filter and any dependency will be loaded, but the relationship between the dependent filter and its dependencies is lost.

Short Description: NEW ENHANCEMENTS TO EVENT ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES IN WEB GUI EXTENSION OFFERING
Summary:

Netcool Operations Insight Extensions for IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI has been enhanced to improve some of the existing features.

- The confidence level shown on the View Seasonal Events page will now show as High/Medium/Low instread of showing the values in percentage. This makes it easier for the users to understand which seasonal events to look at.
- Improvements to the Related Event Details page.

When there are large number of events that causes the timeline chart to show scrollbars, and when the user scrolls down the list, the scale at the top scrolls out of the view. This makes is slightly difficult to understand the deviation of events from the pivot event.We have now made the scale fixed so that the scale is still visible when user is scrolling down the timeline chart.

In the previous release the scale on the timeline chart used to show the time as hh:mm:ss, now it to shows the time in either hours,minutes or seconds depending on the deviation of other events from the pivot event. Additionally, have also provided some help tooltip which makes it easier to understand the timeline chart

Short Description: THE "ALL" VS "ANY" LOGIC IN TOOL DEFINITION FORMS DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TOP LEVEL AND NESTED CONDITIONS
Summary:

The fix introduced by APAR IV83183 has a known regression. As it enforces the "ALL" boolean operator for all access criteria and all multiple values, it fixes an issue where the "!=" operator would not be applied to all values in conjunction with the "ALL" boolean operator. However, with the "=" equality operator, that fix would evaluate all values with "ALL", which does not make sense since a given event will only have one value.
This fix enforces the exception above: if an access criterion uses "ALL" and "=", multiple values will be treated with the "ANY" boolean operator.

If DASH is killed and restarted while an Event Viewer is open in an existing session, it is possible to click to launch a tool in the invalidated session and the pop-up window redirects to the login screen instead of the original window. Depending upon the nature of the pop-up, it can be possible to navigate within the new window.

Summary:

User prompted with "Failed to get local display time from server" when user try to create Quick Filter on DateTime fields. Issue only happen when WebGUI installed with none default root context.

Short Description: NON-ADMIN USER CAN MODIFY GLOBAL VIEW EVEN THOUGH USERS.GLOBAL.VIEW.MODE IS 0
Summary:

There is a narrow security issue, where a non-administrative user (with no "ncw\_admin" role) can be made able to edit a global view, even if the "users.global.view.mode" property is set to 0 in the "server.init" file (it does default to 1).
When the "users.global.view.mode" property is set to 0, non-administrative users are not supposed to be able to edit and save global views.
However, due to an error in the conversion of the view type in the editor forms, there is a way for a non-administrative user to edit a global view anyway.

alm00322196 / IV83183

.....................

Short Description: FIELD ACCESS CRITERIA INCORRECTLY APPLIED
Summary:

The "any" VS "all" boolean operator (equivalent to boolean "AND" vs "OR") used to define the behavior of access criteria does not apply to multiple values for a given access criterion.
Therefore, given a "Class" multi-value of "X" and "Y", with the non-equality operator set ("!=") and the "ALL" boolean operator set, a tool will still be available in the Event Viewer if it has either Class X or Y, because the evaluation treats the values as "ANY" (read: if the event has class "X", the condition for "not class Y" applies and returns true, and vice-versa).
This fix ensures that the "ALL" boolean operator is evaluated for multiple values as well.
There is a known regression, with the "=" equality operator: since an event can't have multiple values for a given field (e.g. "Class"), when "ALL" and "=" is used in the same access control, applying to multiple field values, the tool will not be available for any given event.
This regression is addressed by internal APAR IV84185, in which a multi-valued field will automatically apply the "any" condition regardless of the actual setting, only if the "=" equality operator is set.
See also a documentation APAR (IV84592), to amend the information on the following page:

[https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ\_8.1.0/com.ibm.netcool\_OMNIbus.doc\_8.1.0/webtop/wip/task/web\_cust\_createtools.html?lang=en]
The reason for the DOC APAR is that AEL is not compatible with the "!=" operator, whereas Event Viewer supports both "=" and "!=". The documentation will also update to reflect the functional changes as per APARs IV83183 (this APAR) and IV84185.

Short Description: IN WEBGUI 8.1 SYETEMOUT.LOG SHOW ERRORS RELATED TO BREEZE.CSS WHEN EVENT VIEWER IS OPENED.
Summary:

Due to changes in DASH theme names, the style resources Web GUI fetches in a number of server pages are  not present anymore.
This in turn is intercepted at servlet filter level and fills the logs with FileNotFoundException s at each page load (e.g. Event Viewer, Event Properties, etc.). There is no regression on the visual side, as the inherited style somehow palliates for the lack of specific resources, and this does not disrupt Web GUI's functionality in any noticeable way.

.....................

Short Description: LINES LIGHTWEIGHT MAPS ARE DISPLAYED INCORRECTLY
Summary:

The framework used to render Lightweight Maps (SVG) will move a line on the X axis based on a specific algorithm.
This algorithm is not particularly well documented at the time of writing, and the resulting transformation might appear as arbitrary - it also does not match the algorithm used by applet-based Maps.
The required transformation uses different factors for lines, resulting in different algorithms:
\* whether the line is "active" (representing a filter) or "static"

\* whether the line is thicker than 3 pixels

\* whether the line is vertical, horizontal, or oblique
The fix generally ensures that lines drawn for maps originally designed to be displayed in applet mode render as close as possible to the original in Lightweight maps.

Short Description: EVENT VIEWER DROPPING OFF RESULTS FROM TOOLS PROMPT
Summary:

The algorithm that "pages" the results of prompt values available from the Event Viewer's menus in 15 items sub-menus (in order not to clutter a single sub-menu) fails to correctly add all the prompt choices - namely it omits the last choice in order of sorting when the total number of items is not a multiple of 15 (the number 15 is an arbitrary value used to page the items).

Summary:

Under certain arbitrary circumstances (e.g. too many applications deployed in the server), the number of files scanned by the JPA transformation hook in the classpath is excessive, and will cause Web GUI's persistence configuration to fail upon startup.
In turn, this will prevent any modification to the elements that are synced by the High Availability framework, such as filters, views, etc. as the synchronization doesn't work (the persistence entities are not enhanced, therefore they aren't recognized by the JPA implementation).

=========================================================================================================================================
16.1 Enhancements

-----------------
alm00322448 / IV83980

.....................

Short Description: EVENT LIST SHOW BLANK / TAKING A BIT OF TIME WHEN UPDATE OR SORT
Summary:

Data is getting compressed via standardized gzip mechanism which reduces the size of data to be transferred when a CURI call is made, thereby improving performance.

- For optimal performance with the Dashboard Application Services Hub CURI runtime environment, you can configure gzip compression.
The compression mechanism requires a patch from DASH. The patch can be found at the location listed below. Once the package is downloaded, unzip it and follow the instructions in the ReadMe\_DASH313\_gzip.txt, that is found within the zip.
For more information about this gzip configuration, go to https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=69ec672c-dd6b-443d-add8-bb9a9a490eba#fullpageWidgetId=W31c1aa6dacd6\_47ab\_9607\_0b3e5632d351&file=a17e6dcb-b793-4af1-a584-877b1c3639ef

alm00325212 / IV93994

.....................

Short Description: OTHER ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW FEATURES
Summary:

- Configurable number of events

  ==============================

  The number of events per request can now be configured in the Event Viewer. This allows more events to be stored in the Event Viewer and lowers the number of requests which need to be made to retrieve new data.

- Map Editor can be launched via Java Webstart

  ============================================

  Applet support is being deprecated by browsers. The new enhancements allow the user to launch the Map Editor via Java Webstart. This allows the Map Editor to run outside the browser context.

- Usability improvements in basic filter tab of Filter Builder GUI

  ================================================================

  RFE 97044: Previously the administrator had to type in values by checking the alerts.conversions table while creating basic filter condition with the fields which have conversion values. With the improvements, administrators are able to choose from the drop down list of auto populated user friendly values for the fields which have conversion values in alerts.conversions table.

- Omnitools replacement for execution of Local tools in Event Viewer

  ==================================================================

  Due to the growing security concerns over plugins and end of support for NPAPI plugins in Firefox browsers, the Omnitools plugin is replaced with a new mechanism which allows the user to download a tool command file and execute it manually. This allows the user to view the file and then execute the tool.

Workaround:

You must first perform an update of the Web GUI base offering and then follow up with an update of the Web GUI extension, in two separate steps.

Another option is to uninstall the old Web GUI extension version 1.2.0.0 released in 2014 and reinstall with its new version 1.2.0.0, release in 2015.

2) Re-open "TestView", at Serial column, verify now the column title converted to "Test&amp;", this is correct.

3) Without modify anything, click Save button.

4) Re-open "TestView" again, at Serial column, now the value of & at column title double converted and become 'Test&amp;amp;". This is wrong.

5) Repeat step4 and step5, you will notice that the column title repeatedly applied the conversion on the & so the column title with & will keep appending with amp;
Expected behaviour:

Do not let the title keep growing when title containing & and when the view being re-save.
Workaround:

None

Short Description: LIGHTWEIGHT MAP MONITOR BOX UNABLE TO RECOVER FROM FAILURE (GREY OUT)
Issue replication:

1) Create a global filter name = A\_GlobalFilter and a system filter name = A\_SystemFilter

2) Create a map with 3 monitor boxes with filters = AllEvents, A\_GlobalFilter, A\_SystemFilter.

3) Create a custom page, add 2 maps into the page, both loading from the same map created from previous steps, but one with applet mode another one with lightweight mode.

4) Verify map works in both applet and lightweight map.

5) In filter builder, delete A\_GlobalFilter and A\_SystemFilter.

6) Go back to the custom map page, verify both applet and light weight map monitor box for both A\_GlobalFilter and A\_SystemFilter grey out after auto refresh ==> as expected.

7) Now recreate back A\_GlobalFilter and A\_SystemFilter

8) Go back to custom page again
Current behaviour:

Notice that applet mode map will recover from grey out, but not for lightweight map.
Expected behaviour:

Light weight map is able to recover from the failure.

Issue replication:

1) Open the Event Viewer, ensure that there are many events loaded.

2) 10 seconds before the Event Viewer auto refresh,  select an event, press shift + arrow down key to perform events selection downwards.
Current behavior:

2) Ensure that  user preference configured with "Column Locking"

3) Apply the View to Event Viewer so that we can see Event Viewer with horizontal scroll bar.

4) Drag the horizontal bar to right most side.

5) Then click on refresh button or wait for auto refresh.
Current behavior:

The Event List moves to the left but not the tally with the column headings.  After a while it returns to normal.
Expected behavior:

Short Description: WHEN YOU COPY A FILTER BUILDER, THE FILTER BUILDER DOES NOT ASSOCIATE WITH A USER VIEW.
Current behaviour:

Launch filter Builder and select any global filter (or system, or group). Copy the filter to your own filters. The edit form prevents association of the filter to your user view.
Workaround:

Save with a  non-user view, re-open the saved filter and notice how now it can associate with a user view.Re-save and verify the filter correctly uses the user view now.
