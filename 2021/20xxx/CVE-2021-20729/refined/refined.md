Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and output encoding of the `redirurl` field within the Captive Portal login page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The Captive Portal page does not validate or encode the `redirurl` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By crafting a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `redirurl` field, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Session Compromise:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information from the user's session.
- **Client-side Attacks:** While the vulnerability does not directly impact the firewall or Captive Portal system itself, it could be used to perform client-side attacks within the user's browser

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manually Crafted URL:** The attacker needs to create a malicious URL with the XSS payload embedded within the `redirurl` parameter.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must be logged into the captive portal and must visit the crafted URL and follow the resulting link to trigger the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to have the ability to construct a URL with the malicious `redirurl` parameter.
- **No Special System Access:** The attacker does not require any access to the firewall or the Captive Portal system itself. The attack targets the client-side.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious URL.
