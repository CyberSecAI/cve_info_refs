Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-20139:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `controller_server` service running on port 9999 of the Gryphon router has an operation (specifically operation 3) that passes user-supplied input unsanitized to a string, which is then executed via a call to `system()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the Gryphon Tower router.
- This can lead to complete compromise of the router, allowing the attacker to control network traffic, access sensitive information, and potentially use the router as a foothold for further attacks on the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted malicious packet to the `controller_server` service on port 9999.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Gryphon Tower router.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerable operation is number 3.
- The `ipaddr` parameter is used to inject the command.
- The command injection is achieved by using shell command substitution, e.g., `;id>/tmp/op3`.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can create a file (`/tmp/op3`) containing the results of the `id` command by sending the following payload to the controller server on port 9999 using `ncat`:

```
echo '{"3":{"ipaddr":";id>/tmp/op3"}}' | ncat --ssl <device-ip> 9999
```
