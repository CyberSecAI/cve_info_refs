Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20745:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of iframes within the Inkdrop application. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to OS command injection when processing files or code snippets containing an invalid iframe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input within iframes, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the system where Inkdrop is running. This could lead to:
    - Confidentiality Breach: Access to sensitive data.
    - Integrity Breach: Modification or deletion of system files.
    - Availability Breach: Denial of service or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Loading a malicious file or code snippet containing a crafted, invalid iframe into the Inkdrop application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious file/code to the Inkdrop application. The user needs to open this file or code snippet in the application.
- The attacker could also trick a user to open a specially crafted markdown file containing the malicious iframe.
- User interaction is required (UI:R).

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in Inkdrop versions prior to v5.3.1.
- The vendor has addressed this issue in v5.3.1 and later versions through an auto-update mechanism.
- The JVN entry provides a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 and a CVSS v2 score of 6.8, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
