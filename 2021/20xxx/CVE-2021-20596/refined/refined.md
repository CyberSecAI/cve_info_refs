Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20596:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference within the Ethernet interface block of the Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC-F series. This occurs when the device receives specially crafted network packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-476:** NULL Pointer Dereference. The affected devices attempt to access memory using a null pointer, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can send specially crafted packets to the affected devices causing a DoS condition in communication with the product. This disrupts the normal communication with the device.
- **System Reset Required:** The device may require a system reset to recover from the DoS state.
- **Control of PLC NOT affected:** The PLC connected to the affected Ethernet interface block is not impacted by this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Specially Crafted Packets:** The attack vector involves sending malicious or manipulated packets to the vulnerable Ethernet interface blocks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to send malicious packets.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The complexity to perform this attack is low.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- FX3U-ENET: Firmware Version 1.14 and prior
- FX3U-ENET-L: Firmware Version 1.14 and prior
- FX3U-ENET-P502: Firmware Version 1.14 and prior

**Mitigation:**
- **Firmware Update:** Update the firmware to the following versions or later:
    - FX3U-ENET: Firmware Version 1.16
    - FX3U-ENET-L: Firmware Version 1.16
    - FX3U-ENET-P502: Firmware Version 1.16
- **Network Security:** Use firewalls or VPNs to prevent unauthorized network access and block access from untrusted networks/hosts.
