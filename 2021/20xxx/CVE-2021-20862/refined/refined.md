Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20862:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control, which leads to the disclosure of anti-CSRF tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control (CWE-284)
- Disclosure of anti-CSRF tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A network-adjacent, unauthenticated attacker can obtain anti-CSRF tokens.
- The attacker can then use these tokens to change the vulnerable router's settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability and obtain CSRF tokens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to access the network where the vulnerable router is located.
- No authentication is required for the initial CSRF token disclosure.
