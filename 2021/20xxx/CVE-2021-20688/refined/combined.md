## JPCERT/CC Addendum

During the meeting of Committee for authorizing the disclosure of unresolved vulnerabilities held on January 22, 2021, it was judged that an advisory for this vulnerability shall be disclosed since all the criteria and conditions described below which are stated in [Standards for Handling Vulnerability related Information of Software Products and Other](http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/netsecurity/vul_notification.pdf) and [Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline](https://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000073901.pdf) have been satisfied.

1. The developer of the product is unreachable:

   JPCERT/CC had tried to reach the developer for a period of time (more than 6 months) however there were no responses from the developer. Therefore the committee reached the conclusion that it is reasonable and appropriate to judge the developer is unreachable.

   - No response to 4 separate emails (sent from September 10, 2007 to August 25, 2011)

   - No response to disclosure of the developer's name (listed on December 16, 2011) in "[List of unreachable developers](https://jvn.jp/en/reply/)" and to the disclosure of the name and its version (listed on March 16, 2012) in “[Information Resuest](https://jvn.jp/en/reply/DID51569494.html)” on JVN

   - No response to the announcement of screening procedure for vulnerability disclosure (sent on December 21, 2020)

3. Existence of vulnerability has been verified:

   It was verified that the product contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability by IPA. Arbitrary script execution on the user's web browser was confirmed which violates the "Integrity" of the product. For verification details, refer to the “Verification” section.

5. Not disclosing this case may result in the risk that product users will have no means to know of the existence of the vulnerability in the product:

   Mitigations for this vulnerability are yet undisclosed by the developer, and it is unable to confirm the developer's grasp of all users of the product.

   It was determined that disclosure of this vulnerability is legitimate under these conditions.

7. There are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate:

   After considering the developer’s stance and the risk to product users, the committee has judged that there are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate or that disclosure may cause any other issues.
