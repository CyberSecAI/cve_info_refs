- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Click Ranker application has a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the web browsers of users who access the Click Ranker page. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal cookies, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of Click Ranker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into the application. This would likely require the attacker to have some level of access to the application to be able to store malicious content. The attacker can then trigger the XSS vulnerability when a user views a page ranking screen.
