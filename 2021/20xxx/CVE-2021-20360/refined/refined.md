- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure HTTP communications are used within IBM Cloud Pak for Applications v4.3.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of insecure HTTP protocol for communication.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The document doesn't specify the impact beyond the general risk of insecure communication.
- **Attack vectors:** The document doesn't specify the attack vector. It could potentially be a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document does not specify required attacker capabilities, but it would likely require the ability to intercept network traffic between components of the application using HTTP.
