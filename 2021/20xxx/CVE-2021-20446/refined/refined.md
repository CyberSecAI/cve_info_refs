Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing or insecure "X-XSS-Protection" header in the Maximo Data Loader (maxloader) component, which is shipped with IBM Maximo for Civil Infrastructure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing or insecure "X-XSS-Protection" header. This header is designed to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by instructing the browser to enable its built-in XSS filter. The absence or misconfiguration of this header can make the application vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to gather sensitive information about the web application through XSS attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web application interface. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application through an XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to inject malicious scripts into the application through XSS, which would require a vulnerable application that doesn't properly sanitize user inputs or set the X-XSS-Protection header.
