Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The installers of multiple Sony products have a DLL search path issue (CWE-427). This means they may load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) from insecure locations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure DLL loading: The installers do not properly validate the location of DLLs they load, making them susceptible to DLL hijacking/planting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can place a malicious DLL in a location that the installer searches, leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local: An attacker needs to place the malicious DLL on the user's local system where the installer is run.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in a location that the installer searches.
- The user needs to execute the vulnerable installer. The vulnerability is triggered during the install process and does not affect already installed software.
- The attacker needs to know which DLL file to place in order to be loaded.

**Affected products:**
- Sony Audio USB Driver V1.10 and prior
- HAP Music Transfer Ver.1.3.0 and prior

**Additional notes:**
- The analysis from JPCERT/CC assumes that the user is tricked into placing a malicious DLL file prepared by an attacker in a specific folder.
- The provided CVSS v3 score is 7.8, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This translates to a local attack with low complexity, no privileges required, but requires user interaction, and can have a high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability
- The CVSS v2 score is 6.8, with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P
