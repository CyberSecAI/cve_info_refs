Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20353:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `EDataGraphImpl` class in IBM WebSphere not properly validating user-supplied data, leading to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is the improper handling of user-supplied data, which allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects that get deserialized by the application. This is a common vulnerability pattern that can have severe impacts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from the context of the user running the WebSphere application, potentially including root.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, requiring no prior authentication.
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to target the vulnerable WebSphere application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires no authentication. They only need to be able to send network traffic to the affected WebSphere server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically within the `EDataGraphImpl` class.
- IBM has released an update to address this issue.
- The vulnerability was reported to IBM by r00t4dm at Cloud-Penetrating Arrow Lab and Longofo at Knownsec 404 Team.
-  The vulnerability is also described as an XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerability in the IBM security bulletin. While the ZDI advisory focuses on deserialization of untrusted data, the IBM bulletin clarifies that this leads to XXE.
