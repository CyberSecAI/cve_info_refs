Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-20137 and other related CVEs affecting the Gryphon Tower router:

**CVE-2021-20137**

*   **Root Cause:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `/cgi-bin/luci/site_access/` page reflects the `url` parameter without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the context of the victim's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user within the Gryphon Tower router's web interface, potentially leading to unauthorized access or changes.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A user is tricked into clicking a specially crafted link containing malicious javascript.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to craft a malicious URL and lure the victim into clicking the link.

**CVE-2021-20138**

*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in the Gryphon web interface via `/cgi-bin/luci/rc`.
*  **Weaknesses:** Multiple parameters passed via POST request to `/cgi-bin/luci/rc` are concatenated without sanitization and executed via `os.execute()`.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated remote attacker on the same network can execute commands as root on the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a specially crafted malicious POST request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/rc` endpoint.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be on the same network as the Gryphon Tower router.

**CVE-2021-20139**

*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in operation 3 of the `controller_server` service.
*   **Weaknesses:** User input for operation 3 is passed unsanitized to a string, which is then executed with `system()`.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated remote attacker on the same network can execute commands as root on the device.
*  **Attack Vectors**: Sending a crafted JSON payload to the `controller_server` service on port 9999.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be on the same network as the Gryphon Tower router.

**CVE-2021-20140**

*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in operation 10 of the `controller_server` service.
*   **Weaknesses:** User input for operation 10 is passed unsanitized to a string, which is then executed with `system()`.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated remote attacker on the same network can execute commands as root on the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted JSON payload to the `controller_server` service on port 9999.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be on the same network as the Gryphon Tower router.

**CVE-2021-20141**

*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in operation 32 of the `controller_server` service.
*   **Weaknesses:** User input for operation 32 is passed unsanitized to a string, which is then executed with `system()`.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated remote attacker on the same network can execute commands as root on the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted JSON payload to the `controller_server` service on port 9999 in two steps.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be on the same network as the Gryphon Tower router.

**CVE-2021-20142**

*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in operation 41 of the `controller_server` service.
*   **Weaknesses:** User input for operation 41 is passed unsanitized to a string, which is then executed with `system()`.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated remote attacker on the same network can execute commands as root on the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted JSON payload to the `controller_server` service on port 9999.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be on the same network as the Gryphon Tower router.

**CVE-2021-20143**

*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in operation 48 of the `controller_server` service.
*  **Weaknesses:** User input for operation 48 is passed unsanitized to a string, which is then executed with `system()`.
*  **Impact:** An unauthenticated remote attacker on the same network can execute commands as root on the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted JSON payload to the `controller_server` service on port 9999.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be on the same network as the Gryphon Tower router.

**CVE-2021-20144**

*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in operation 49 of the `controller_server` service.
*  **Weaknesses:** User input for operation 49 is passed unsanitized to a string, which is then executed with `system()`.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated remote attacker on the same network can execute commands as root on the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted JSON payload to the `controller_server` service on port 9999.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be on the same network as the Gryphon Tower router.

**CVE-2021-20145**

*   **Root Cause:**  Unprotected OpenVPN configuration/credentials.
*   **Weaknesses:** OpenVPN configuration file is accessible on the Gryphon Router.
*   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to access the Gryphon homebound VPN network, potentially accessing LAN interfaces of other users' devices connected to the same service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Retrieving the ovpn configuration file from the Gryphon Router, and connecting to the VPN network.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs the ability to retrieve the ovpn config from the router.

**CVE-2021-20146**

*   **Root Cause:** Unprotected SSH private key present on the Gryphon devices.
*   **Weaknesses:** SSH private key is present on Gryphon devices without protection.
*   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to gain root access to a server affiliated with Gryphon's development and infrastructure.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Using the private key to log in to the associated server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs the ability to retrieve the private key from the router.
