- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The GU App for Android fails to properly restrict access permissions when launched using a custom URL scheme, leading to an access restriction bypass.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control ([CWE-939]). The app allows a custom URL scheme to launch and redirect the user to an arbitrary URL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can trick a user into accessing a malicious website by using the vulnerable app via a crafted custom URL scheme, potentially leading to social engineering attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker uses a malicious custom URL scheme to trigger the vulnerability in the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious custom URL scheme and convince a user to launch the application with it.
