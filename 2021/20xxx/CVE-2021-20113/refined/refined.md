Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-20113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from inconsistent error handling during the password reset process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure:** The system reveals whether an email address is registered with a user account by displaying different responses: a specific 'unknown email' error if the email isn't registered and no error if the email is registered.
- **User Enumeration:** This inconsistency allows an attacker to probe the system with different email addresses and determine which ones are associated with valid user accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **User Enumeration:** Attackers can create a list of valid email addresses associated with registered users, which is valuable for targeted attacks. This information could be used to launch phishing campaigns, brute-force attacks, or other attacks.
- **Loss of Privacy:** Disclosure of email addresses associated with user accounts can have an impact on user privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
- **Unauthenticated:** No user authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker only needs network access to the system with the vulnerable TCExam instance.
- No special privileges or user accounts are needed. The attacker can perform the enumeration without logging in.
