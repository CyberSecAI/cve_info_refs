I love your online site generator. Finding your website ended many hours of struggle to understand sitemaps. It's so easy to use and the broken links function is extremely helpful.

Unbelieveable! This was extremely easy to
understand--especially for the "not so computer savvy"
and the tech support helped me incredibly.

The SAME
day my sitemap was submitted to Google by tech
support, my site was indexed. I am absolutely thrilled
and wish I had found you all sooner!

Niki
