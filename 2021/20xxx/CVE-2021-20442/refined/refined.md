- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Verify Bridge (ISVB) used a hard-coded key to encrypt the client secret string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a hard-coded encryption key. All ISVB users share the same encryption key.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The shared encryption key could allow an attacker to decrypt client secrets of other users.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to encrypted secrets could decrypt them using the hard-coded key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the encrypted client secret and knowledge of the hard-coded key.
