## Description

![@ibodrov](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/826959?v=4&size=48)[ibodrov](https://github.com/ibodrov)opened [on Jan 12, 2021](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/2715#issue-783901313)

A recently found [vulnerability](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2021/q1/19) was fixed in [another project](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/issues/1491) similar to this one. It might potentially affect [a similar implementation](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/c9bf95da45f2560a7be7651fc37db5257c5418b1/kubernetes-client/src/main/java/io/fabric8/kubernetes/client/dsl/internal/core/v1/PodOperationsImpl.java#L563) in `PodOperationsImpl`.

Ironically, [it prints out the normalized path](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/c9bf95da45f2560a7be7651fc37db5257c5418b1/kubernetes-client/src/main/java/io/fabric8/kubernetes/client/dsl/internal/core/v1/PodOperationsImpl.java#L574) into stdout, but uses the original (potentially dangerous) path.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c0)  Jonathan Christison    2021-02-01 16:46:25 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the fabric8 kubernetes-client where a malicious pod/container may cause applications using the fabric8 kubernetes-client `copy` command to extract files outside the working path, the main impact of this flaw is to integrity and availability of the kubernetes-client host.   Upstream report: <https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/2715>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c1)  Jonathan Christison    2021-02-01 16:46:30 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Ivan Bodrov, Marc Nuri (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c2)  Jonathan Christison    2021-02-01 16:46:31 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/2715>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c19)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-20 00:58:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  In OpenShift Container Platform 4 (OCP) there are no plans to maintain the ose-logging-elasticsearch5 container, therefore it has been marked wontfix at this time and maybe fixed in a future update.  Red Hat CodeReady WorkSpaces 2.7.0 does not ship fabric8-kubernetes-client and is therefore not affected by this flaw.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c20)  Jonathan Christison    2021-03-22 12:23:11 UTC  ``` Marking Red Hat AMQ Online has having a low impact, although a vulnerable fabric8-kubernetes-client version is distributed and used with AMQ Online, the vulnerable functionality (PodOperationsImpl/copy) it is never used by AMQ Online.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-25 09:43:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat AMQ Online 1.7.0 GA  Via RHSA-2021:0986 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0986](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0986)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c22)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-03-25 11:35:13 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Privileges Required None (PR:N) - Agree here, the attacker does not necessarily need to be a privileged user eg. no login required to exploit the base flaw.  User Interaction None (UI:N) Mostly agree here, a user may not need to be coerced into performing any action for this flaw, an attacker can expect to be successful if the prerequisite set out in attack complexity section are true and the copy() command/method is invoked, invoking of the command could be by a user manually (invoked as part of a specific end application function) or automatically as a batch process in the end application.   Scope Unchanged (S:U) Agree here, the attacker will not be able to escape the scope of the executing JVM solely due to this flaw   Impact Metrics:  Confidentiality None (C:N) Agree here, there is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component, the attacker is unable to divulge any information with this attack alone  Integrity High (I:H)  We agree in principle here, in a successful attack a malicious file may be extracted to any location on the target (end user) machine to which the user under which fabric8 kubernetes client end application is running, these permissions would in most circumstances result in a low impact integrity, however in this case the files likely modifiable or overwritable present a direct and serious consequence e.g overwriting administrative tools used in the administration of the kubernetes or openshift cluster   Availability High (A:H) We agree here, in a successful attack, files associated with fabric8 kubernetes client could be overwritten and its functionality could persistantly be inaccessible to a user until these files are recovered/replaced. ie. the user might be unable to connect to the openshift/kubernetes cluster   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-29 11:13:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Quarkus  Via RHSA-2021:1004 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1004](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A1004)   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-08-18 09:13:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Integration  Via RHSA-2021:3205 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3205](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A3205)   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-08-18 09:55:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Integration  Via RHSA-2021:3207 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3207](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A3207)   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-12-14 21:33:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.10  Via RHSA-2021:5134 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:5134](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A5134)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-01-26 15:53:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHPAM 7.12.0  Via RHSA-2022:0296 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0296](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0296)   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1923405#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-01-26 16:56:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHDM 7.12.0  Via RHSA-2022:0297 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0297](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0297)   ``` |  |
