Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, it is located within the "Edit screen of Content Data".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the "Edit screen of Content Data". This occurs due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of a logged-in user's web browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions:
    - Stealing user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Modifying content on the page.
    - Performing actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires some form of user interaction, likely the user visiting a manipulated page containing the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script in the "Edit screen of Content Data". This might involve manipulating parameters, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or leveraging social engineering to get a legitimate user to inject the script, which other users may access.
- The attacker can be unauthenticated as this particular XSS does not require authentication.

**Affected Versions:**
- Movable Type 7 r.4903 and earlier (Movable Type 7 Series)
- Movable Type Advanced 7 r.4903 and earlier (Movable Type Advanced 7 Series)

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Movable Type 7 r.5001 (v7.8.0) and Movable Type 6.8.1
