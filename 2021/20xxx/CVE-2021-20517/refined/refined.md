- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A directory traversal vulnerability exists in WebSphere Application Server ND.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal, allowing an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended webroot.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive files and directories on the server, leading to information disclosure. The extent of access depends on the permissions of the application server process.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is not explicitly specified in the text, but it can be inferred that it involves sending crafted requests to the WebSphere Application Server, likely through HTTP, that contain directory traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable WebSphere Application Server. Specific network access is not mentioned, but access via network would be required.
