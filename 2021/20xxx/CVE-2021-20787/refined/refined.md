Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Specifically, when an administrator is logged in, sending a specially crafted request to a specific URL can lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This could allow for a range of malicious activities.
*  **Compromise Admin Accounts:** Since the vulnerability requires the user to be logged in as an administrator, this could allow the attacker to escalate privileges and compromise the entire application and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning it can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to lure an administrator to access a specific crafted URL while they are logged into the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Target Administrator:** The attacker needs to have an administrator of the application access a crafted URL while being logged in.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in GroupSession versions from 2.2.0 to versions prior to 5.1.0. This includes the Free, byCloud, and ZION editions.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
*   The vendor has released version 5.1.0 as a fix.
