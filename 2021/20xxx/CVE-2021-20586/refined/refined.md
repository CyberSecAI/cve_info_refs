- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Resource management errors (CWE-399) in the robot controllers of MELFA FR series and CR series as well as ASSISTA.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a DoS of the execution of the robot program and the Ethernet communication by sending a large amount of packets in burst over a short period of time. This may lead to an error that requires restarting the robot controller to recover.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a large amount of packets in burst over a short period of time via network communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the robot controllers.
