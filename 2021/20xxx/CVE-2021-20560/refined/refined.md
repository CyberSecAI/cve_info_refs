- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The HTTP header 'X-Frame-Options' is not present in the IBM Sterling Connect:Direct Browser User Interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing X-Frame-Options header.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The absence of the X-Frame-Options header can potentially allow clickjacking attacks, where an attacker can embed the vulnerable application within a frame on a malicious website and trick users into performing actions they did not intend.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through a web browser by loading the vulnerable application in a frame on a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website that embeds the vulnerable application within an iframe. The attacker needs no credentials beyond the ability to direct a user to the malicious page.
