{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The messaging feature in Moodle did not impose a character limit when sending messages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of input validation or sanitization on the length of messages, leading to a client-side denial of service.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user receiving a very large message could experience a client-side (browser) denial of service, potentially freezing or crashing their browser.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a very large message through the Moodle messaging system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any user with the ability to send messages within the Moodle platform."
