Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)** issue. Specifically, the vulnerability is present in the Aterm WG2600HS product.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79):** The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser when they interact with the vulnerable application.
*   This could potentially lead to various attacks, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Stealing of sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **Network-based** (AV:N). An attacker can inject a malicious script by sending a request containing the script to the vulnerable web page.
*   The attack requires user interaction because the injected script is executed on the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker doesn't need any privileges on the vulnerable device (PR:N)
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with a maliciously crafted URL containing the XSS payload (UI:R).
*   The scope of the vulnerability is changed, meaning that the malicious script will be executed within the context of the web application in the user's browser (S:C)

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to the Aterm WG2600HS device.
*   The provided information aligns with the description of a reflected XSS vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is rated as having a "Low" confidentiality impact, a "Low" integrity impact, and no availability impact, according to CVSS v3.
