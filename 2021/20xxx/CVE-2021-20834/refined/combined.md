October 24, 2024App was great for ordering nike gear, great selection, and quick shipping. The prices were good too. Now, it doesn't work at all. I can not add anything to my cart. Nike needs to figure it out. Losing sale after sale. I deleted and re downloaded it 3 times now, and it has the same result. Will not allow me to add to the cart . So, APP DOES NOT WORK!!! HOPE NIKE FIXES THIS SOON. It WAS great.105 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVMin_uxC5RPtPPyfKJXglOES7Vk22REDojWzaylO0aPq_Osn0Z=s32-rw)Rivoningo Blessing Sithole*more\_vert*

October 28, 2024The app for the past year, it takes 2x to enter the effort amount and get it to stay after a workout. Now w each update, it just blows out the history of effort on past workouts AND now it just doesn't remember it at all! It remembers where I did it, home, gym, etc, but not the effort level! Vry frustrating! Also, stop logging me out w each new update. That's annoying.51 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews

### Definitely Recommend

> Been using this app for several years now. Easy to search/find, good selections, timely notice for sale, and recently added ânew dropâ list is very convenient. I like ânotificationâ function, as sometime I overlook for a drop.
> Chat service is excellent. They are always friendly yet polite also. Response time is always w/in few minutes after posting.
> Only problem is some items shows video of items not available colors. (Sometime I like the color of video item better)
> One point I appreciate if can be done. Some clothing shows a model wearing top, bottom, shoes, caps, etc, but only listed for 1 item like hoodie. I have to look for the bottom, but canât find it sometime. I wish sku number was listed for whatâs in a photo. The same can be applied for cover photo of item, like shoes.

### Ehhhhh

> So I got the app a few months ago. I copped the Jordan 13s like in the middle of the week. Which shocked me cause I thought copping Jordanâs would b me that easy. Boy was I wrong. When Jordanâs drop trying to get a pair is IMPOSSIBLE. Itâs a game basically. The app stores all your info; name, address, even card info. So you go to the app on the day of a drop, 7am, thinking youâre gonna get a win that day. You find the shoes you want. Confirm that you want them. Then youâre placed in a âwaiting roomâ for 5 mins. They youâll get an alert saying âwe donât have your sizeâ WHO IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE. Itâs like you go to the mall. Go into a store and pick out the shoes you want, size and all. You go to the register and give them your credit card. After they swipe it they tell you âgo sit over there and wait before you walk outâ. Then the person working in the store says âoh can I have your shoes back. This person who just walked in wants themâ. I get Nike doesnât really care as long as theyâre selling shoes. But these guys with the âbotsâ are the ones that keep getting the shoes. Why not make those guys verify that they arenât âbotsâ. Just my thoughts. Iâm sure Nike couldnât care any less about my opinion

### Huge security flaw! My accnt was hacked!

> They NEED to get this security problem under control! My accnt just got hacked and the customer service informed me that itâs very likely the hacker got in thru the app. Someone successfully got into my accnt and made a purchase, but somehow, I didnât receive one single email or notification until I saw the âorder shippedâ notification from the app. And still no email confirmation or notification at all!
> Whatâs making it worse is that the customer service rep told me that it was escalated to the fraud dept., and they are trying to stop the order being delivered. And just suggested I change my password. That was it. I asked if I were to given updates on the caseâs status, like whether the payment will be refunded, or if the account was going to be safe to use, and whatâs going with the email notification on my purchase or activity, the rep just told me no one is going to follow up or reach out to me. They are just going to resolve it (whatever that means?)
> Iâm deeply disturbed and disappointed in Nike for both their security and their custom service!
