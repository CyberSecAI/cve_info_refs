# JVN#66422035 Android Apps developed using Yappli fails to restrict custom URL schemes properly

## Overview

Android Apps developed using Yappli fails to restrict custom URL schemes properly.

## Products Affected

* Android Apps that are developed in Yappli since v7.3.6 and prior to v9.30.0

## Description

Yappli provided by Yappli, Inc. is an application development platform.

Android Apps that are developed with Yappli provide the function to access a requested URL using Custom URL Scheme.

The access to the function is not restricted properly ([CWE-939](//cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/939.html)) which may be exploited to direct the App to connect to unintended sites.

## Impact

When accessing a malicious website containing a specially crafted URL, the vulnerable app may be directed to connect to some unintended site.

As a result, the app's internal information may be leaked and/or altered.

## Solution

**Solution for developers of affected applications**

Rebuild the application in the latest development environment. Until the rebuilt version is published, remove the affected version from an application store.

**Solution for users of affected applications**

Please inquire the application developer.
