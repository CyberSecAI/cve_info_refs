- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of custom URL schemes in Android apps developed using the Yappli platform. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate or sanitize the URLs accessed via custom URL schemes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-939, which refers to "Improper Authorization of Custom URL Schemes". The application doesn't properly restrict access to the custom URL scheme functionality, making it vulnerable to abuse.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  -  The app can be directed to connect to unintended sites by a malicious URL.
  -  This could lead to the leakage and/or alteration of the app's internal information.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious website containing a specially crafted URL can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that will be accessed by a user through the vulnerable app. User interaction is required since the user needs to click the malicious link. The attacker does not require a specific position to conduct the attack other than having the malicious website/link available.
