- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Yomi-Search program does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary scripts into the web browser of users accessing a website using the vulnerable Yomi-Search, potentially leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through the network, likely through manipulating input fields or URL parameters used by the Yomi-Search program. The user must interact with the manipulated input (e.g., by visiting a malicious link).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts through network-based requests. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
