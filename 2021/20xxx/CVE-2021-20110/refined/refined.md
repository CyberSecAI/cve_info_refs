- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent does not validate HTTPS certificates, allowing a network attacker to impersonate the server. The agent then makes an HTTP request vulnerable to an integer overflow when handling the "Content-Length" header of a POST response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of HTTPS certificate validation, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - Integer overflow when processing the "Content-Length" header, leading to a heap overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on the agent machine.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network attacker statically configures their IP address to match the Asset Explorer's server IP.
    - Attacker sends a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent.
    - Attacker intercepts agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken.
    - Attacker sends a malicious POST response to the agent with a large "Content-Length", triggering the integer overflow and heap overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable agent.
    - The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the agent and the legitimate server.
    - The attacker needs to know the server's IP address.
    - The attacker must be capable of crafting and sending malicious HTTP responses.
