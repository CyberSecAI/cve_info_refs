Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in IBM Maximo Asset Management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious script can be injected into the application's database, which is then executed by other users when they view the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application that would execute in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to:
    *   Data theft (e.g., session hijacking).
    *   Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacement of the application.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker injects malicious script into a field or area of the application where rich text can be added. When another user views the page with the stored malicious script, it will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated and have the ability to insert text (including potentially malicious script) into the application's database.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   IBM Maximo Asset Management core product versions 7.6.1
*   Industry Solutions products (using an affected core version):
    *   Maximo for Aviation
    *   Maximo for Life Sciences
    *   Maximo for Nuclear Power
    *   Maximo for Oil and Gas
    *   Maximo for Transportation
    *    Maximo for Utilities
*   IBM Control Desk products (using an affected core version):
    *   SmartCloud Control Desk
    *   IBM Control Desk
    *    Tivoli Integration Composer

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the appropriate interim fix or fix pack for the affected product versions.
*   Set the `webclient.richtext.truncate` system property to `1` in the System Properties application to truncate rich text to 1M bytes.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The document suggests that older versions may also be affected and recommends upgrading to the latest version.
*   The vulnerability was reported to IBM by Keith Lee.
