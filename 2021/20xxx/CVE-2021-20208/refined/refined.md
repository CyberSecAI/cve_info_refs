Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20208:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `cifs.upcall` handles Kerberos authentication in containerized environments. When a process within a container triggers a kernel upcall to `cifs.upcall` (e.g., when accessing a multi-user CIFS mount or a DFS link), `cifs.upcall` executes in the host's environment. This allows the container to potentially access and utilize the host's Kerberos credential caches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Credential Leakage:** The primary weakness is the leakage of Kerberos credentials from the host environment into the container. This happens because `cifs.upcall`, running in the host environment, has access to the host's Kerberos credential caches.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While not a direct privilege escalation within the container, the ability to use host Kerberos credentials allows a container process to potentially access resources that it wouldn't normally have permissions for. This can lead to unauthorized access to SMB shares and potentially data exfiltration or manipulation, compromising confidentiality and integrity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity Compromise:** A successful exploit allows a malicious or compromised container to access SMB resources using the host's Kerberos credentials. This can lead to the container accessing or modifying data without proper authorization.
*   **Lateral Movement:** While not explicitly stated, the unauthorized access may also enable lateral movement on the network if the compromised credentials can be used to access other network resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Containerized Applications:** A malicious or compromised application running inside a container is the primary attack vector.
*   **Triggering `cifs.upcall`:** The attack requires that the containerized application trigger an event that results in the kernel invoking the host's `cifs.upcall` binary. This includes actions that require multi-user CIFS mounts or DFS link traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to run code inside a container:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a container that has access to a CIFS mount configured for multi-user access with Kerberos authentication.
*   **Understanding of the CIFS multi-user and DFS features:**  The attacker needs a basic knowledge of how to trigger the upcall through multiuser or DFS features in the CIFS implementation.
*   **Access to a host with Kerberos tickets:** The host system must have Kerberos tickets in the cache of the users.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in `cifs-utils` version 6.13. However, later information indicates that some important fixes were missed in version 6.13 and 6.14 contains the final fixes.
*   Mitigation included disabling DFS and multi-user mounts in the container's SMB mount options by adding the 'nodfs' option and removing 'multiuser'.
*   The vulnerability is rated as having a "Moderate" impact due to the need for elevated privileges and limited attack possibilities. An attacker does not gain access to the actual Kerberos credential cache but can trigger an authentication attempt.
