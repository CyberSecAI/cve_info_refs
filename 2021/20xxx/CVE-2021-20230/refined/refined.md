    "Description": "stunnel: client certificate not correctly verified when redirect and verifyChain options are used",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The stunnel server does not correctly validate the client certificate when the `redirect` and `verifyChain` options are used together.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper certificate validation"
    ],
     "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with a certificate not signed by the correct Certificate Authority can bypass the redirect and access the tunneled service, leading to a potential compromise of integrity and/or confidentiality.",
