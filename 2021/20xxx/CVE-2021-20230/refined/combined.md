| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1925226#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-02-04 16:15:34 UTC  ``` stunnel before version 5.57 does not correctly verify the client certificate when options `redirect` and `verifyChain` are used. `redirect` redirects TLS client connections to another address when there is a certificate-based authentication failure and `verifyChain` is used to verify the client certificate starting from the root CA (specified in CAfile or CApath). When these options are used together, the stunnel server does not correctly validate the client certificate, allowing a client with a certificate not signed by the right CA to access the service without being redirected to the specified `redirect` address.

# stunnel: Improper certificate validation — GLSA **202105-02**

Stunnel was not properly verifying TLS certificates, possibly
allowing an integrity/confidentiality compromise.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/stunnel** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.58** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.58** |

### Background

The stunnel program is designed to work as an SSL/TLS encryption wrapper
between a client and a local or remote server.

### Description

It was discovered that stunnel did not correctly verified the client
certificate when options “redirect” and “verifyChain” are used.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted certificate, possibly
resulting in a breach of integrity or confidentiality.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All stunnel users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/stunnel-5.58"

```

| [Description](#c0)  Running Wild    2002-02-19 15:18:29 UTC  ``` I just installed a fresh Gentoo Linux system and tried to configure it using "Gentoo Linux  Desktop Configuration Guide" which is found on gentoo.org website. I was following the  instructions on that guide and when I got to a point where I invoked the command "emerge  kde-base/kdebase" (KDE Desktop), the ebuild did not succeed to install due to error in  AudioFile ebuild.  All the dependencies compiled OK. It was the last package (the actual KDE) that stopped  telling me it can't find a library file.  A nice fellow from Russia (forgot your handle, sorry!) was able to help me out with this when I  was asking for help on #gentoo IRC-channel. After investigating the problem he was able to  come up with a solution that worked - I needed to edit "/usr/lib/libaudiofile.la". The error is on the  very last line of that file. The last line looks like this:  libdir='/var/tmp/portage/audiofile-0.2.3/image//usr/lib'  ...and you will need to change it to this:  libdir='/usr/lib'  Now try "emerge kde-base/kdebase" again and it will work OK. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-20 12:09:35 UTC  ``` The same was reported in [bug #368](show_bug.cgi?id=368 "RESOLVED FIXED - kde-base/kdebase fails to build"), but that eventually got closed because the submitter didn't respond and it arrived at a dead end.  I suspect this can affect other things than libaudiofile. In any case emerging libaudiofile again seemed to generate a correct libaudiofile.la (in the #368 case). Please try it, but even if it helps we need to fix this.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Running Wild    2002-02-20 13:35:39 UTC  ``` Emerging libaudiofile again did not help in my case. I needed to edit /usr/lib/libaudiofile.la to  make it work.  Dan, you were right, this can affect other things than libaudiofile also. Once I got KDE up and  running, I wanted to emerge some additional software - it installed without any problems, but  when I tried to emerge XMMS by typing "emerge media-sound/xmms", it aborted. The error was  exactly similar TYPE than I had with KDE.  Here's the output:  /bin/sh ../libtool --mode=link i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc  -mcpu=i686 -march=i686 -O3 -pipe -Wall  -DG_DISABLE_CHECKS=1 -DG_DISABLE_ASSERT=1  -o libgconf-1.la -rpath /usr/lib -version-info 1:3:0 gconf-internals.lo gconf-backend.lo gconf-changeset.lo gconf-error.lo  gconf-glib.lo gconf-listeners.lo gconf-locale.lo gconf-schema.lo gconf-sources.lo gconf-value.lo  gconf.lo GConf-common.lo GConf-skels.lo GConf-stubs.lo  -L/usr/lib -loaf -lORBitCosNaming  -lORBit -lIIOP -lORBitutil -lglib -lm -L/usr/lib -rdynamic -lgmodule -lglib -ldl grep: /var/tmp/portage/ORBit-0.5.13-r1/image//usr/lib/libIIOP.la: No such file or directory sed: can't read /var/tmp/portage/ORBit-0.5.13-r1/image//usr/lib/libIIOP.la: No such file or directory libtool: link: `/var/tmp/portage/ORBit-0.5.13-r1/image//usr/lib/libIIOP.la' is not a valid libtool archive make[2]: *** [libgconf-1.la] Error 1 make[2]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/gconf-1.0.8/work/GConf-1.0.8/gconf'make[1]: ***  [all-recursive] Error 1 make[1]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/gconf-1.0.8/work/GConf-1.0.8' make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2  !!!

(no error message)  !!! emerge aborting on  /usr/portage/gnome-base/gconf/gconf-1.0.8.ebuild .   ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-21 02:55:41 UTC  ``` I've posted all this plus some more info on gentoo-core (the gentoo developer-only subscriber-access-only mailing list). It's more or less acknowledged to be a generic problem now (wiht binutils apparently), people have reported seeing it in all sorts of packages. So someone else will be handling it soon I hope (I'm just the KDE guy).  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-23 13:02:42 UTC  ``` This is the problem discussed in the gentoo-core thread " ${D} getting into generated .la files (e.g. libaudiofile.la) - info needed". See for more info there.  Noone responded when I asked on that thred for someone to handle this, although some more info came thouh (see thread), so drobbins - I'm reassigning this to you, please give it to someone better equipped to deal with it.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-27 16:58:58 UTC  ``` It seems to be a problem with libtool relinking libs at 'make install' time when the prefix=${D}/usr.  I do not know if there is a workaround other than 'sed -e "s:${D}::g" /{usr,usr/lib,usr/X11R6/lib}/*.la'.  I guess we could contact the libtool author/maintainer. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-04 12:21:05 UTC  ``` Im closing this bug.  It is a difficult problem, and users should just report problems as they go.  The latest libtool should fix most of these; just libtoolize it by adding before ./configure:  libtoolize --copy --force ``` |  |
