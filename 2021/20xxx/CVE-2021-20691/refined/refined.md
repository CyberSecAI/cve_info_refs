- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Yomi-Search program contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (CWE-79). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a user accessing a website using the vulnerable Yomi-Search software. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through user interaction with a web page that uses Yomi-Search.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the Yomi-Search application, which is likely done through input fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized. The attacker does not need any special privileges or to be on the local network.
