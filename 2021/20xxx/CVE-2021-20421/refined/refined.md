- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists when requesting resources over an API endpoint to verify URLs from a target application server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could allow an attacker to make requests to internal resources or other systems that the server has access to.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted requests to an API endpoint that verifies URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.
