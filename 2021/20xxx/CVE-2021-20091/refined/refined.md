Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-20091:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The web interfaces of Buffalo WSR-2533DHPL2 firmware version <= 1.02 and WSR-2533DHP3 firmware version <= 1.24 do not properly sanitize user input. Specifically, it occurs in parameters passed from `apply_abstract.cgi` to the device's global config file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Improper input sanitization.
- Configuration file injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An authenticated remote attacker could alter device configuration.
- This can potentially lead to remote code execution (demonstrated by enabling telnetd).

**Attack vectors:**

- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/apply_abstract.cgi` with injected parameters.
- The attacker needs a valid `httoken` and must send the request with a `Referer` header.
- An attacker can exploit a related path traversal vulnerability to bypass authentication if needed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-  The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface, or alternatively leverage CVE-2021-20090 path traversal vulnerability to bypass authentication and access the affected CGI.
- Knowledge of the device's API and the injection points in the configuration file.
- Ability to send HTTP requests with specific headers and data.
