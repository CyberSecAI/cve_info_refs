Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20662:

**CVE-2021-20662: Missing authentication for critical function**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication checks for certain critical functions within the SolarView Compact device's web interface. Specifically, it is possible to bypass authentication by directly inputting a URL to an authenticated page.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Missing Authentication:** Critical functions that should require authentication are accessible without it.
    *   **Direct URL Access:** The system allows direct access to protected pages through URL manipulation.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can bypass the intended authentication mechanisms.
    *   An attacker can potentially alter the setting information on the device.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Adjacent:** The attack requires network access to the vulnerable device, as it is exploited via the web interface.
    *   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by directly accessing specific URLs that should be protected by authentication, but are not.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network (or have access to the network) as the SolarView Compact device.
    *   **Knowledge of URLs:** The attacker needs to know or be able to discover the specific URLs that are vulnerable to this bypass.

**Summary of other vulnerabilities from the same report:**

The provided documents also detail several other vulnerabilities within the same product (SolarView Compact). These include:

*   **CVE-2021-20656: Exposure of information through directory listing** - An attacker can obtain directory listings, potentially revealing sensitive information.
*   **CVE-2021-20657: Improper access control** - An attacker can obtain or alter settings information without proper authorization.
*  **CVE-2021-20658: OS command injection** - An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands.
*  **CVE-2021-20659: Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type** - An attacker can upload arbitrary files including malicious ones.
*   **CVE-2021-20660: Cross-site scripting** - An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web interface.
*   **CVE-2021-20661: Directory traversal** - An attacker can delete arbitrary files and/or directories.
*   **CVE-2011-0762, CVE-2011-4362, CVE-2013-4508, CVE-2013-4559, CVE-2013-4560, CVE-2014-2323, CVE-2014-2324: Using components with known vulnerabilities** - The system uses vulnerable versions of vsftpd and lighttpd.
