Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-20076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) unserialization within Tenable.sc and Tenable.sc Core versions 5.13.0 through 5.17.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The application's failure to properly sanitize or validate serialized data before unserializing it allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Tenable.sc server. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **PHP Unserialization:** The attacker must be able to send specially crafted serialized data to be processed by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated, Unprivileged User:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a Tenable.sc user account, though no special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is present in Tenable.sc and Tenable.sc Core versions 5.13.0 to 5.17.0.
- The vendor has released a patch (SC-202103.1) to address this issue.
- The vulnerability was reported by Nicolas Verdier from TEHTRIS.
- CVSS v3 score is 8.8 (High), indicating a serious risk.
- CVSS v2 score is 6.5 (Medium).

This content provides more detail than the basic CVE description by specifying the vulnerable versions, attack vector, and the fact that the attacker needs to be an authenticated, unprivileged user.
