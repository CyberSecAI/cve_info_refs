Debian Bug     : 986796 992703 990450 990899 1014828

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in OpenEXR, command-line
tools and a library for the OpenEXR image format. Buffer overflows or
out-of-bound reads could lead to a denial of service (application crash) if
a malformed image file is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.1-4.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Intermediate calculation in Imf::dataWindowForTile overflowed if dataWindow.min + tileSize was larger than INT\_MAX, potentially causing insufficient memory allocation. Throw some more bits at the problem.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1939151#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2021-03-15 17:26:44 UTC  ``` Heap-buffer-overflow in Imf_2_5::copyIntoFrameBuffer   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1939151#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2021-03-15 17:26:48 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=25505>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1939151#c2)  Michael Kaplan    2021-03-15 17:48:25 UTC  ``` Created OpenEXR tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1939178](show_bug.cgi?id=1939178 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-20303 OpenEXR: Heap-buffer-overflow in Imf_2_5::copyIntoFrameBuffer [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1939151#c3)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-30 23:19:37 UTC  ``` Upstream PR which references patch commit and confirms it's association with aforementioned oss-fuzz report: <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/831>  Flaw summary:  An integer overflow in IlmImf/ImfTiledMisc.cpp function dataWindowForTile(), when dataWindow.min + tileSize > INT_MAX, could lead to an out-of-bounds write of heap buffer. The data written does not appear to be directly controllable via this flaw, but could be combined with other flaws to achieve a greater impact.   ``` |  |
