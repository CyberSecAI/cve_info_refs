{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in `Imf::dataWindowForTile` function. The intermediate calculation `dataWindow.min + tileSize` could overflow if the result is larger than `INT_MAX`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
     ],
    "impact": "An out-of-bounds write on the heap, potentially leading to application crash (denial of service) and potentially data integrity issues.",
    "attack_vectors": "Processing a malformed OpenEXR image file with crafted `dataWindow` and `tileSize` values.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted image file to be processed by OpenEXR.",
    "details": "The vulnerability exists in `Imf::dataWindowForTile` function. When calculating the size of the tile, if `dataWindow.min + tileSize` exceeds `INT_MAX`, the resulting integer overflow leads to a smaller-than-expected memory allocation for the tile buffer. Consequently, writing to this undersized buffer can result in a heap-based out-of-bounds write. The written data is not directly controllable, but it could be combined with other flaws."
