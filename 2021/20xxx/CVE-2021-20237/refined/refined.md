```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in ZeroMQ's src/xpub.cpp where metadata in messages are not properly handled. Specifically, when a PUB socket receives messages with metadata, the metadata is kept referenced in the PUB object but is never freed.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Memory leak: Unprocessed metadata is stored for PUB sockets and never released leading to memory leaks."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can send crafted PUB messages, causing excessive memory consumption on the server which can lead to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted PUB messages to a ZeroMQ server with CURVE/ZAP authentication disabled.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send messages to a vulnerable ZeroMQ server. No authentication is required if CURVE/ZAP is disabled."
