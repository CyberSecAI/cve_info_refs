Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-20792:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of URL query parameters within the "Quiz And Survey Master" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin was not sanitizing the search input when displaying quiz lists, making it vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS). This occurs because user-supplied input, specifically the search query, is not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML output of the plugin's admin pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the vulnerable search input. When an administrator views the affected page with the crafted URL, the injected script will execute within their browser.
*   **Session Hijacking/Credential Theft:** The attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to steal session cookies, gain access to sensitive information, or perform actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload within the search parameter.
*   **Social Engineering/Phishing:** The attacker could send this malicious URL to an administrator or trick them into clicking a link that directs to the vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** An attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameter and how to craft the malicious URL.
*   **Ability to deliver malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to deliver the crafted URL to a victim (administrator). This could be through social engineering, email, or other means.
*   **Targeted User Interaction:** The victim (administrator) needs to visit the crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions of Quiz and Survey Master prior to 7.1.14.
*   The vulnerability was specifically identified in the `quizzes-page.php` file.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the user-provided search input using `htmlspecialchars`

**Summary of Fix:**

The fix involved using `htmlspecialchars()` to properly encode the search query parameters before they are outputted in the HTML. This prevents the browser from interpreting the malicious JavaScript as code and thus prevents XSS.
