- **Root cause of vulnerability**: OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device is vulnerable to OS command injection (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated network-adjacent attacker can execute multiple OS commands with root privileges on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-adjacent, meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be within the same network segment as the vulnerable router and does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
