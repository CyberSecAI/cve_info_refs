- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Hot Pepper Gourmet App uses Custom URL Scheme to access requested URLs, but it has an improper access control vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284). The application does not properly restrict which applications can send it requests, allowing arbitrary apps to send requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can trick a user into accessing an arbitrary website via the vulnerable app. This can lead to phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a crafted URL to the vulnerable app, potentially via a different app.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a URL request that will be handled by the vulnerable application through its custom URL scheme. No special privileges are needed and user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
