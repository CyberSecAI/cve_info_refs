| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1939153#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2021-03-15 17:26:52 UTC  ``` Integer-overflow in Imf_2_5::hufUncompress   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1939153#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2021-03-15 17:26:56 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=25562>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1939153#c2)  Michael Kaplan    2021-03-15 17:40:29 UTC  ``` Created OpenEXR tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1939174](show_bug.cgi?id=1939174 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-20300 OpenEXR: Integer-overflow in Imf_2_5::hufUncompress [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1939153#c3)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-29 23:20:15 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/commit/ed560b8a932c78d5e8e5990ce36fe7808b35d9f0>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1939153#c4)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-29 23:24:09 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  in hufUncompress of OpenEXR/IlmImf/ImfHuf.cpp, nBits+7 could overflow in the calculation of `if ( ptr + (nBits+7 )/8 > compressed+nCompressed)`. This could lead to an impact to application availability if nBits is too large. The patch casts to 64-bit type to prevent this.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1939153#c7)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-29 23:44:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw does not affect OpenEXR shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, or 8 because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of OpenEXR.   ``` |  |

Debian Bug     : 986796 992703 990450 990899 1014828

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in OpenEXR, command-line
tools and a library for the OpenEXR image format. Buffer overflows or
out-of-bound reads could lead to a denial of service (application crash) if
a malformed image file is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.1-4.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
