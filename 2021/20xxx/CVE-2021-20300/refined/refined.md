Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-20300:

**Root Cause:**
- Integer overflow in the `hufUncompress` function within `OpenEXR/IlmImf/ImfHuf.cpp`. Specifically, the calculation `(nBits + 7) / 8` can overflow when `nBits` is large, leading to a smaller-than-expected size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the insufficient size check during decompression using the hufUncompress function. The check `if ( ptr + (nBits+7 )/8 > compressed+nCompressed)` was prone to integer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The integer overflow leads to an incorrect size calculation, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read or write during decompression. This can result in a denial-of-service (application crash).

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted, malformed OpenEXR image file containing a large `nBits` value that triggers the overflow during the decompression process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted OpenEXR file to a system or application using the vulnerable version of OpenEXR to trigger the overflow.

**Additional details:**

- The fix involves casting the `nBits` value to a 64-bit type during the size calculation to prevent the overflow.
- This vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
- The vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of OpenEXR, therefore, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 are not affected.
- The fix was included in OpenEXR version 3.0.0-beta and later.
