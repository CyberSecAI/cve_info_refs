  "CVE-2021-20289": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The endpoint class and method names are returned as part of the exception response when RESTEasy cannot convert one of the request URI path or query values to the matching JAX-RS resource method's parameter value.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information exposure through error messages",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of potentially sensitive information about internal APIs, which could aid further attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a request with invalid parameters to trigger the exception and expose information.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the application with specific (invalid) parameters that the application will attempt to convert."
