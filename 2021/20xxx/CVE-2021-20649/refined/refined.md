Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **Improper server certificate verification (CWE-295)** during firmware update checks. The device fails to properly validate the SSL/TLS certificate of the server it communicates with for updates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Server Certificate Verification:** The device does not correctly verify the server's SSL/TLS certificate, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** A successful MITM attack allows an attacker to modify the communication response during the firmware update check process. This modified response can contain malicious instructions leading to arbitrary OS command execution on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the device and the update server to intercept and manipulate network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker must be able to perform a MITM attack, meaning they need to have control over a network node between the vulnerable device and the update server. This could be achieved by compromising a router, gateway, or other network equipment in the same network.
*  No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
* The affected product is WRC-300FEBK-S.
* The vendor recommends to stop using the product.
* The vendor recommends not to execute the firmware's "Check for update files" function.
* The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the device.
