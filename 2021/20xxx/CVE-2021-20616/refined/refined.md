Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The installer for SKYSEA Client View insecurely loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). This is due to an issue with the DLL search path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **DLL Preloading/Hijacking:** The application's installer is vulnerable to DLL preloading or hijacking. It doesn't properly validate the location from where it loads DLL files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the installer is run.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must execute the vulnerable installer for exploitation. The user would also have to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer prior to execution.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker must place a malicious DLL file in the same directory as the installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file in the same directory as the installer.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into running the installer.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects the installers (including the main installer, deployment installer, and uninstaller) for the software and not the installed application itself.
*   The vulnerability is present in SKYSEA Client View versions 1.020.05b to 16.001.01g.
*   The vendor has provided a fix that requires the user to use the latest installer.
