  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a Cross-site request forgery (CSRF).",
  "weaknesses": [
    "CWE-352"
  ],
  "impact": "If a user accesses a specially crafted page while logged in, unintended operations may be performed.

This may allow attackers to obtain CSRF tokens and modify device configurations.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Network-based attack. User needs to access a specially crafted page while logged in."
  ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to entice a logged-in user to visit a malicious page. The attacker does not require direct access to the device, but does need to be on a network where the device is accessible."
