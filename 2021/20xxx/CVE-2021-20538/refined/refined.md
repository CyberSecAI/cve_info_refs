- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient authorization controls in IBM Cloud Pak for Security versions 1.5.0.1 and earlier.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information can be obtained without sufficient authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can potentially access sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The bulletin does not specify the exact attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The bulletin indicates that a user can obtain sensitive information without sufficient authorization, which implies that an attacker would likely need to be a user within the system, although it does not specify what specific privileges the attacker must have.
