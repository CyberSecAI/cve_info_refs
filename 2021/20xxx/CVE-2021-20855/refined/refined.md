Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20855:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in the web interface of the affected ELECOM LAN routers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts on a logged-in user's web browser when they access the router's management interface. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
  - Session hijacking: Stealing the user's session cookies and gaining control of the user's session.
  - Information theft: Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
  - Phishing: Redirecting the user to a malicious website disguised as the legitimate management page.
  - Defacement: Modifying the content of the management interface.
  - Further exploitation: Potentially using the XSS to gain further access to the device

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack through the web interface of the router
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into accessing a specially crafted link or page containing malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into the web interface of the router that a logged-in user will access.
- The attacker needs a logged-in user to visit the crafted URL or page.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the device; they just need to be able to inject the malicious script, such as in a stored XSS scenario, and have a user interact with that interface while logged in.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple ELECOM LAN router models with specific firmware versions.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
- CVSS v3 base score: 5.4
- CVSS v2 base score: 3.5
