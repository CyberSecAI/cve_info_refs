{
  "vulnerability_information": {
    "CVE-2021-20132": {
      "root_cause": "The Quagga network configuration services (zebra and ripd) on D-Link DIR-2640 routers use default, hardcoded credentials.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of hard-coded credentials",
        "Lack of proper access control"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain administrative access to the zebra or ripd services, which are running with root privileges. This allows complete control over the services and potentially the router.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote, adjacent network access.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same adjacent network and needs to know the default credentials. No user interaction is required."
    },
    "CVE-2021-20133": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of filenames used for the 'message of the day' banner in Quagga services.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Absolute path traversal vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can read sensitive files by setting the 'message of the day' banner to any file on the system, potentially disclosing hashed credentials, plaintext passwords, configuration files, and private keys. An attacker can also cause a denial of service by setting the 'message of the day' path to special device files such as /dev/urandom.",
       "attack_vector": "Remote, adjacent network access.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same adjacent network and have administrative access to the Quagga services."

     "CVE-2021-20134": {
        "root_cause":"Improper handling of log file paths in the Quagga command line interface.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Absolute path traversal vulnerability",
          "Improper log handling"
        ],
      "impact": "An attacker can append arbitrary content to any file by setting the path for the log file and then issuing log messages. This can lead to remote code execution as root by appending to a shell script and then triggering it or waiting for it to be executed. The technique can be used to install backdoors.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote, adjacent network access.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same adjacent network and have administrative access to the Quagga services."
