Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is not explicitly stated in the document. However, it mentions that the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or programs on the affected public display models. This suggests a flaw in the display's software or firmware that doesn't properly validate or sanitize input, allowing for remote command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The primary weakness is the ability for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or programs on the affected displays. This is a critical vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain control over the affected display, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Modify display content
    *   Access or modify sensitive data
    *   Use the display as a jumping-off point for further attacks on the network
    *   Disrupt display functionality

**Attack Vectors:** The document does not specify the attack vector, but given the nature of the vulnerability, it is likely to be:
*   **Network-based:** The exploit is most likely delivered over the network, since the displays are described as "public displays" that are often networked. The vulnerability is likely reachable through network interfaces, potentially over HTTP or other network protocols used by the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the display. The specific access requirements (e.g., same subnet, internet access) are not mentioned. However, the workaround of using the product only in a safe intranet protected by a firewall implies that the vulnerability is network-accessible.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** An attacker would need some technical knowledge to exploit the vulnerability, including the specific network protocols used by the display and how to inject malicious commands.

**Additional Notes:**
* The document also mentions CVE-2021-20699, which is a related vulnerability.
* The document provides a workaround by either applying a firmware update or by ensuring that the display is behind a firewall on a protected intranet and not exposed to the internet.

In summary, CVE-2021-20698 is a critical vulnerability that allows for arbitrary command execution on specific Sharp/NEC public display models. The attack vector is likely network-based, and successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise.
