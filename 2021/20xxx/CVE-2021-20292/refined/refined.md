{
  "CVE-2021-20292": {
    "Root cause": "The TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU drivers did not handle allocation failures as expected, leading to a double-free on failure.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Double-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user on a system using a vulnerable GPU driver could potentially cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or achieve privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user on a system using a vulnerable GPU driver."
