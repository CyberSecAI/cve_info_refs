Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-20212:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in Privoxy when multiple filters are executed and the last filter is skipped due to a PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak in the `pcrs_filter_response()` function within filters.c when a PCRE error causes a filter to be skipped, resulting in memory not being freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The memory leak can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition if the memory consumption continues to grow, potentially causing the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting requests that, when processed by Privoxy, cause multiple filters to be executed. The final filter in the sequence must result in a PCRE error causing it to be skipped to trigger the leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be able to send requests that cause the vulnerable filter execution path to be triggered, meaning the attacker must have network access to the Privoxy service.
