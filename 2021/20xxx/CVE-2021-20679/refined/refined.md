- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted command sent to the Fuji Xerox multifunction devices and printers can cause a denial-of-service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition caused by a malformed command.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in the device being terminated, requiring a physical power cycle to restart the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A) according to the provided CVSS vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the affected device to send the malformed commands. No user interaction or authentication is needed (PR:N, UI:N), according to the provided CVSS vector.
