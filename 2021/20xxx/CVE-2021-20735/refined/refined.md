- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization, allowing execution of arbitrary scripts through specific operations on the EC-CUBE management page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) exists in multiple ETUNA EC-CUBE plugins.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts on the web browser of a user accessing the administrative page of the affected EC-CUBE plugins. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or data theft.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the management page of the vulnerable EC-CUBE plugins. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through specific operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate input fields in the administrative interface. User interaction is required as the malicious script will be executed in the context of a user's browser.
