Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20196:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content directly references CVE-2021-20196 and provides details about the vulnerability. It is related to a null pointer dereference issue in the Floppy disk emulator of QEMU. The vulnerability occurs when a floppy drive isn't initialized with a block device, leading to a crash when read/write ioport commands are processed. This aligns with the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause lies in the QEMU Floppy disk emulator's handling of read/write ioport commands when a selected floppy drive is not properly initialized with a block device. Specifically, when the emulator attempts to access a block device through a null pointer, a crash occurs.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `fdctrl_read_data` function, where `cur_drv->blk` can be `NULL` if the floppy drive isn't initialized, leading to an attempt to access memory at address 0 which causes a crash.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a crash of the QEMU process on the host. This results in a denial of service for the guest virtual machine and any services dependent on the QEMU instance. The guest operating system will also crash.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Ioport Read/Write Commands:** The vulnerability is triggered through read or write operations via ioport commands within the QEMU floppy disk emulator.
  
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Privileged Guest User:** An attacker must be a privileged user within the guest operating system. This allows them to directly interact with the floppy disk emulator's ioport and trigger the vulnerability.
  -  The attacker should also be able to make ioport changes to select a non initialized floppy drive.

**Additional Technical Details:**

   - The vulnerability lies in `hw/block/fdc.c` within the QEMU source code.
   - The issue occurs because `fdctrl->drives[0]->blk` is not always properly initialized, and a privileged guest user can change the selected drive via the `FD_REG_DOR:fdctrl_write_dor()` ioport write command, triggering the vulnerability when a read/write ioport command is then sent.
   - The vulnerability can be triggered by changing the selected drive to a non-initialised drive via `fdctrl->cur_drv = value & FD_DOR_SELMASK`.
   - The vulnerability was discovered in Qemu-5.2.0.
   - The vulnerability can be triggered through `blk_pread` function call inside `fdctrl_read_data` when the `cur_drv->blk` is NULL.
   - A patch was proposed which includes an if statement to check for a valid block device before attempting to use it inside the `fdctrl_write_dor` and `fdctrl_read_data` functions.

   - The provided information also includes a reproducer code (`fdc.c`), which helps to reproduce the crash. However, it seems that a small tweak to the command-line parameters or parameters under the gdb environment is required to trigger the crash.
   - The vulnerability was reported by Gaoning Pan of Zhejiang University & Ant Security Light-Year Lab.

In summary, CVE-2021-20196 is a DoS vulnerability in QEMU's floppy disk emulator, triggered by a null pointer dereference caused by a privileged guest user using ioport write/read operations on a non-initialized drive.
