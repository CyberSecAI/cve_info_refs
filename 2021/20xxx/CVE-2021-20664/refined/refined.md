Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, it exists in the "Asset registration screen" of Movable Type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- The specific weakness is that the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the asset registration screen, thus allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed in the context of the user's browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing sensitive information.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- An attacker could craft a malicious URL or payload that, when accessed through the vulnerable asset registration screen, injects and executes the malicious javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication (PR:N)
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious URL to trigger the vulnerability (UI:R - User interaction is required).
- This is a reflected XSS, so the malicious payload needs to be part of the request.

**Affected versions:**
- Movable Type 7 r.4705 and earlier
- Movable Type Advanced 7 r.4705 and earlier
- Movable Type 6.7.5 and earlier
- Movable Type Premium 1.39 and earlier
- Movable Type Premium Advanced 1.39 and earlier

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is mitigated by updating Movable Type to version r.4706 (v7.6.0) or later for the 7 series, and 6.7.6 for the 6.7 series.

This analysis provides more specific details than the CVE description, by identifying the vulnerable component as the "Asset registration screen" and clarifies that it is a reflected XSS attack.
