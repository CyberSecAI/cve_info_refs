Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-20129:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls on the `/ACSServer/ExportServlet` endpoint, specifically for exporting system logs in Draytek VigorConnect 1.6.0-B3.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated access to sensitive system logs.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The system does not verify the identity or authorization of the user requesting log exports.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain access to potentially sensitive information contained in system logs, which could include configuration details, user information, or other data that could be used to further compromise the system or network.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable Draytek VigorConnect server.
*   **Unauthenticated Request:** The attacker can directly send an HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint without providing any authentication credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the Draytek VigorConnect server over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability allows for downloading various types of logs by modifying the `type` parameter of the request. For example, `type=SystemLog` for system logs or `type=ActionLog` for action logs.
*   Tenable assigned the vulnerability a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) and identified it as an information disclosure vulnerability (CWE-200)
*  The issue is fixed in VigorConnect 1.6.1
