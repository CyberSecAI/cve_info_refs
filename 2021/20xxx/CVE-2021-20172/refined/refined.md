Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `postinstall` script of the Netgear Genie macOS installer. Specifically, the script uses `sudo open -a /Applications/NETGEARGenie.app/Contents/MacOS/LoginItem` without verifying the contents of the binary that is being opened.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure File Handling:** The installer does not validate the binary being executed by the `open` command.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the binary path to point to a malicious executable, an attacker can achieve root privileges when the installer executes the command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local user can gain root privileges on the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **System Compromise:** Full system control can be achieved.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system where the Netgear Genie installer is being used.
- **File Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the file system by placing a malicious binary or symlink where the installer expects to find `LoginItem`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the macOS system.
- **Timing:** The attacker must be able to plant the malicious binary/symlink before the Netgear Genie installer runs the vulnerable command in its `postinstall` script.

**Additional details:**
- The Tenable advisory provides a specific exploit example using a symbolic link to Safari to show how to gain root privileges.
-  The advisory also notes that the vendor has not informed Tenable of a fix for the issue.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8, indicating a High severity.
- The affected product is the Netgear Genie Installer Package for macOS.
