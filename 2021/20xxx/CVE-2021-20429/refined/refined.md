- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The User Behavior Analytics application add-on for IBM QRadar SIEM has an overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Overly permissive CORS policy, which could allow unauthorized access to resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could potentially exploit the overly permissive CORS policy by making cross-origin requests from a malicious website or application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to make requests from a different origin than the vulnerable application.
