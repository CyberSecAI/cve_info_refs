Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20321:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A race condition exists in the overlayfs filesystem driver. Specifically, the `ovl_rename` function was missing a check for a negative dentry when performing a rename operation with the `RENAME_EXCHANGE` flag set.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability stems from a race condition during the rename operation in overlayfs.
*   **Missing Check:** The `ovl_rename` function was missing a check to ensure the target dentry (newdentry) is not negative when the RENAME_EXCHANGE flag is used. This allows an attacker to bypass security checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and its underlying upper directory can exploit this race condition to gain elevated privileges (root).
*   **System Crash:** The Red Hat bugzilla entry also mentions a potential system crash.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Overlayfs Mount:** The attacker must have access to an overlayfs mount.
*   **Upper Directory Access:** The attacker must have access to the underlying upper directory of the overlayfs mount.
*   **Specific Rename Operation:** The exploit requires a specific sequence of rename operations, including a rename with a negative dentry and using the `RENAME_EXCHANGE` flag. The reproducer provided in lore.kernel.org shows this specific scenario:
    ```
      mkdir lower upper work merge
      touch lower/old
      touch lower/new
      mount -t overlay overlay -olowerdir=lower,upperdir=upper,workdir=work merge
      rm merge/new
      mv merge/old merge/new & unlink upper/new
    ```
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   A local user account on the system.
*   The ability to create or access an overlayfs mount.
*   The ability to interact with the files within the mount and its underlying directories.

**Additional notes:**
* The fix involves adding a check for negative dentries in the ovl\_rename function to prevent the race condition.
* The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions before the fix.
* Several distributions have released updates to address this issue.
* The provided information indicates that this issue can also cause a system crash, besides privilege escalation.
* The `RENAME_EXCHANGE` flag in `vfs_rename()` allows atomic exchange of two file names.
