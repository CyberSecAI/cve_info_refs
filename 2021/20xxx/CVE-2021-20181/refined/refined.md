  "CVE-2021-20181": {
    "description": "A race condition flaw was found in the 9pfs server implementation of QEMU. This flaw allows a malicious 9p client to cause a use-after-free error, potentially escalating their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity as well as system availability.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a Time-Of-Check Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in the QEMU Plan 9 file system (9pfs) server implementation. Specifically, the v9fs_mark_fids_unreclaim function stores a fidlist member on the stack, and when using a coroutine, restores it. If v9fsclunk(), which frees the fid, is called while the coroutine is executing, the coroutine restores a freed fid and uses it, resulting in a use-after-free.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition",
	  "TOCTOU"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a use-after-free, potentially escalating privileges on the system and allowing arbitrary code execution in the context of the hypervisor, leading to a loss of confidentiality, integrity and system availability.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local attackers exploiting a malicious 9p client.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system."
