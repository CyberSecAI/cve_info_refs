- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization within the IBM Sterling Order Management web UI, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This could lead to credentials disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI of IBM Sterling Order Management.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to insert the malicious script within a part of the application where it is not correctly sanitized.
