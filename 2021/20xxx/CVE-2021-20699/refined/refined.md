Based on the provided document, here's the analysis for CVE-2021-20699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The document states that the identified Public Displays "allows an attacker arbitrary command or program execution". However, the exact technical details of the vulnerability are not given.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary commands or programs on the affected public displays. This indicates a severe flaw in the device's firmware or operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute commands of their choosing, potentially leading to:
    *   Complete compromise of the display system.
    *   Data theft if the device stores or processes sensitive information.
    *   Use of the display in further attacks.
    *   Disruption of the intended function of the display.

**Attack Vectors:** The document does not specify the attack vector, but it is implied the vulnerability could be exploited over the network, given the provided workaround instructions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would likely need network access to the vulnerable display. The document recommends isolating the displays within a firewall-protected intranet as a workaround. This suggests that the exploit would be network-based and could be triggered from outside the local network if the display is not properly protected.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects multiple models with different firmware versions:
  *   UN462A, UN462VA, UN492S, UN492VS, UN552A, UN552S, UN552VS, UN552, UN552V, UX552S, UX552 (Firmware R1.300 and prior)
  *   V864Q, C861Q, P754Q, V754Q, C751Q, V984Q, C981Q, P654Q, V654Q, C651Q, V554Q (Firmware R2.000 and prior)
