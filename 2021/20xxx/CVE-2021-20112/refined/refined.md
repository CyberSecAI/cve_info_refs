Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-20112

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of file uploads in TCExam, specifically through `tce_select_mediafile.php`.
- Files uploaded with a filename beginning with a period are rendered as `text/html` instead of the intended file type.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of sanitization of uploaded filenames.
- Incorrect file type handling, causing arbitrary file content to be interpreted as HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can upload a malicious JavaScript payload by using a filename starting with a period.
- When a user views the uploaded file (either directly or through other TCExam pages), the malicious script is executed within their browser session. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vector:**
- The attacker uploads a malicious file via `tce_select_mediafile.php`.
- The malicious payload is triggered when the file is viewed by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the `tce_select_mediafile.php` upload functionality. This likely requires a valid user account with appropriate permissions.
- They must be able to craft and upload a malicious JavaScript payload disguised as a file.
