Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The SNKRDUNK Market Place App for iOS failed to properly verify SSL server certificates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Improper server certificate verification ([CWE-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)). This means the app doesn't correctly validate the authenticity of the server it's communicating with, specifically its SSL/TLS certificate.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A successful man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack could allow an attacker to:
    *   **Eavesdrop** on the communication between the app and the server, potentially intercepting sensitive data.
    *   **Alter** the communication, potentially injecting malicious content or manipulating data being exchanged.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack via a malicious Wi-Fi access point.
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable app and its server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to set up a malicious Wi-Fi access point that the user connects to.
*   The attacker must be able to intercept and potentially modify network traffic between the user's device and the SNKRDUNK server.
*   No specific user interaction is required other than the user connecting to the malicious network.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.0 of the app.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Okazawa Yoshihiro of Cryptography Laboratory, Tokyo Denki University.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 4.8 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)
*   The CVSS v2 score is 4.0 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)
