  - Cookie theft
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement
  - Redirection to malicious websites

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages related to the device, which are then executed in the user's browser when they access those pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into accessing a malicious web page. The attacker must be able to inject malicious scripts into pages viewed by the device user. A user interacting with the device's web interface through their browser is required for the attack to succeed.
