Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-20149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU router has insufficient access controls for the WAN interface. Specifically, the default iptables ruleset only applies to IPv4 traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate IPv6 Filtering:** The primary weakness is the lack of filtering for IPv6 traffic on the WAN interface. Services intended to be protected by firewall rules are inadvertently exposed via IPv6.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Access to Services:**  An attacker can access all services running on the device through the WAN interface using IPv6, bypassing intended IPv4-based firewall restrictions.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information/Functionality:** This would allow attackers to potentially gain access to internal administration tools, device configuration, or any other service running on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:**  The attack can be performed remotely through the WAN interface.
*   **IPv6 Network:** The vulnerability is specifically exploited using IPv6 traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the device's WAN interface.
*   **IPv6 Support:** The attacker's network must be capable of sending IPv6 packets to the target device.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker is not required to authenticate to gain access to the vulnerable services via IPv6.

**Additional Notes**

*   The content from tenable.com provides more details than the standard CVE description.
*   This vulnerability is categorized as "critical" due to the high impact and low attack complexity.
*   The vulnerability can allow for full compromise of the device because any service running on it is exposed to the WAN side.
