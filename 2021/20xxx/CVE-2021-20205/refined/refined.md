Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20205:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A divide-by-zero error occurs within the `libjpeg-turbo` library when processing a crafted GIF image. Specifically, this occurs in the `start_input_gif` function in `rdgif.c` when the GIF image has a specified width or height of 0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Divide-by-zero:** The code fails to handle cases where the width or height of the GIF image is zero, leading to a floating-point exception.
*   **Lack of input validation:**  The library does not properly validate the dimensions of the GIF image before processing it.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause a crash due to the floating-point exception, resulting in a denial of service. This makes affected applications or systems unavailable. The vulnerability primarily affects the `cjpeg` utility but could affect other applications using the vulnerable library, although it's stated that only `cjpeg` is directly affected in some contexts.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted GIF image:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted GIF image with a width or height set to zero as input to a vulnerable application or system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide input to an application or service that uses the vulnerable `libjpeg-turbo` library and attempts to process a GIF image.
*   No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `libjpeg-turbo` versions 2.0.90 (which is also referred to as 2.1 beta1) and 2.0.91 (pre-release builds).
*   The issue was introduced in the 2.1 beta release with the addition of LZW-compressed GIF support for `cjpeg`.
*   A fix was implemented in commit `1719d12e51641cce5c77e259516649ba5ef6303c`, which adds a check for zero width or height before proceeding with image processing.
*   The fix involves adding a check for zero width or height and returning an error instead of proceeding with division, preventing the divide by zero error.
*   Red Hat initially classified the vulnerability as having "low" severity, but the impact is still a denial of service.

The provided information gives a good view of the vulnerability, its impact and how the fix was implemented.
