Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20271:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in RPM's signature check functionality within `headerMergeLegacySigs()`. This function copies signature tags from the signature header to the main RPM metadata header without proper validation. Specifically, the code does not check if the tag types and sizes meet expectations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Length Checks:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper checks on the length/size of the data copied from the signature header to the main RPM header, allowing for a corrupted RPM package with malicious content. This also includes lack of validation of types.
*   **Unvalidated Tag Copying**: The logic in `headerMergeLegacySigs()` allows copying of unknown tags from the signature header into the RPM header.
*   **Bypass signature checks**: Corrupted RPM package with modified signature headers bypass RPM's signature verification.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **RPM Database Corruption:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can create a seemingly verifiable package with a modified signature header that corrupts the RPM database if installed.
*   **Code Execution:** By corrupting the RPM database, it may allow code execution. 
*   **Compromise of Data Integrity, Confidentiality, and Availability:** The vulnerability may lead to a loss of data integrity, potentially resulting in unusable or untrusted data, it can expose confidential information, and cause system unavailability by disrupting package management.
*   **System Instability:** The vulnerability may render headers inaccessible within the RPM database causing bad tag errors, installed packages not retrievable, missing dependencies that are actually installed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious RPM package installation:** Convincing a victim (user/system) to install a seemingly verified, but maliciously crafted RPM package is the main attack vector.
*   **Compromised RPM repository:** By compromising an RPM repository, an attacker can replace legitimate packages with malicious ones.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Craft a malformed RPM package:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the signature header of an otherwise valid RPM package without invalidating its signature.
*   **Victim Action:** The attacker needs to convince or trick a user into installing the modified RPM package.
*   **Local Access:** While the attacker needs local access to execute the compromised RPM file, it is not required for the vulnerable system, as the compromised RPM could be installed over the internet using a compromised repository.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Demi Marie Obenour.
*   The issue was fixed upstream in RPM 4.16.1.3 (as well as a later patch in commit `d6a86b5`).
*   Red Hat issued security advisories to address this vulnerability, for example RHSA-2021:2574, RHSA-2021:2791, RHSA-2021:4771, RHSA-2021:4785, RHSA-2021:4975.
*   StarWind software is also affected by this vulnerability, SW-20220805-0002.

**Summary of extracted information:**

* **Root Cause:** Incorrect handling of signature headers during package installation leading to RPM database corruption.
* **Vulnerabilities:** Missing length and type checks while copying signature tags, allowing for code execution, data integrity and system availability issues.
* **Attack Vector:** Installation of a malicious RPM package with a modified signature header.
* **Impact:** Potential RPM database corruption, code execution, data integrity, confidentiality, and system availability loss.
