Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-20408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The encryption key used by IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) to encrypt and decrypt product credentials was stored in an ISIQ configuration file, which was not sufficiently protected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure Storage of Cryptographic Key: The vulnerability lies in storing the encryption key in a configuration file, making it accessible to unauthorized users if they gain access to the file system or the configuration files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access to Product Credentials: Attackers could potentially obtain the encryption key and decrypt product credentials, leading to unauthorized access to the products managed by ISIQ.
- Compromise of Security: The confidentiality of the product credentials is breached, which can lead to further security compromises within the ISIQ environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Access to the ISIQ configuration file: An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the file system or the configuration files could extract the encryption key. This access could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Exploiting other vulnerabilities in the ISIQ system or the underlying platform
    - Gaining unauthorized access to the server or system where ISIQ is running.
    - Using stolen credentials to access the server or system where ISIQ is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to access the ISIQ configuration file on the server/system where the ISIQ is running
- Knowledge of the location and format of the ISIQ configuration file

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects IBM Security Verify Information Queue versions 1.0.6 and 1.0.7.
- The fix involves updating to version 10.0.0 or greater, where ISIQ now uses a separate Vault service for handling encryption and decryption requests.
- The document provides links to the ISIQ starter kit page for instructions on accessing and deploying the updated images.
- No workarounds or mitigations were available aside from updating the vulnerable version
