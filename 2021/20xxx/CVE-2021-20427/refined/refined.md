Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts". This means the system doesn't properly limit the number of failed login attempts, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The core weakness is the lack of proper rate limiting or lockout mechanisms for failed authentication attempts.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system through brute-forcing credentials.
*  **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the authentication interface of IBM Security Guardium. Attackers would attempt to login with various credentials repeatedly.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker would need to be able to reach the login interface of the affected IBM Security Guardium instances. They would also need to have some knowledge or guess at valid usernames in order to successfully execute a brute-force attack.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM Security Guardium versions 11.2 and 11.3.
*   Fixes are available for both affected versions.
*   No workarounds or mitigations are provided other than applying the fix.
