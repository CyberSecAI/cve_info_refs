{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `client_send_params` function of GnuTLS, specifically when handling the `pre_shared_key` extension in TLS 1.3. The vulnerability occurs because the `extdata->data` buffer is reallocated, making the `client_hello.data` pointer invalid, leading to a use-after-free when accessing the reallocated buffer later.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to memory corruption and denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious client sending a large Client Hello message with the `pre_shared_key` extension.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to initiate a TLS 1.3 connection with a vulnerable server, and craft a specific Client Hello message to trigger the vulnerability. No prior authentication is needed.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered when the client sends a large Client Hello message with the 'pre_shared_key' extension. The issue was exposed using a fuzzer tool and by modifying the gnutls_buffer allocators to force realloc() to always take a simpler strategy of memory allocation. The vulnerability affects GnuTLS versions prior to 3.7.1."
