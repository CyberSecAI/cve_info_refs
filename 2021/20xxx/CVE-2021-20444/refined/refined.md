- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Maximo Data Loader (maxloader), shipped with IBM Maximo for Civil Infrastructure, has a missing or insecure "X-Content-Type-Options" header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing or insecure "X-Content-Type-Options" header, leading to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Gathering of sensitive information about the web application, such as usernames, passwords, machine names, and sensitive file locations.
- **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly stated, but implied to be via web requests due to the missing header and the potential for XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Not specified, but likely requires the ability to send requests to the vulnerable application.
