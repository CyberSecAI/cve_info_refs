Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20683:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **Improper Neutralization of JavaScript input** within the blog article editing function of baserCMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the blog article editing feature. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they view the affected blog article. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Stealing session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user within the application
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Blog Article Editing:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the blog article's detailed content editing field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the privilege to edit blog articles. (The JVN description lists this as "PR:L" - low privileges)
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction, as the malicious script executes when a user views the crafted blog article ("UI:R" - user interaction required).
