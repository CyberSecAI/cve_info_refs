Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20265:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content from `bugzilla.redhat.com` explicitly mentions `(CVE-2021-20265)` and its corresponding description. The git commit log also relates to the fix of this vulnerability. Therefore, the content is related to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `unix_stream_recvmsg` function within the Linux kernel. Specifically, it arises from a memory leak when a signal is pending during the execution of this function, leading to the function breaking out of its loop without releasing allocated resources (specifically `scm`).
*   **Weakness:** The core weakness is improper resource management, specifically a missing `scm_destroy(&scm)` call when a signal interrupts the `unix_stream_recvmsg` loop.
*   **Impact:** The impact is a Denial-of-Service (DoS). An unprivileged local user can trigger the vulnerability by sending signals repeatedly to a process using unix stream sockets, causing the system to exhaust available memory.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is local.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the vulnerable system and trigger signals while a process is calling `unix_stream_recvmsg`.

**3. Technical Details (from git commit log):**

*   The patch adds `scm_destroy(&scm);` before the `goto out;` statement within the `if (signal_pending(current))` block of `net/unix/af_unix.c`. This ensures that `scm` is properly released when the loop is interrupted by a signal.
*   The commit message notes that the bug was reported by Dmitry Vyukov, and that it is a struct pid leak detected by a syzkaller program.

**4. Additional Information:**

*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry also mentions that the fix was backported into RHEL 6, and 7.
* The Oracle CPU for October 2021 lists this as addressed by a patch to Tekelec Platform Distribution, referencing the kernel CVE.

| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Root Cause                   | Improper handling of signal interrupts in `unix_stream_recvmsg`, leading to missing resource release.                                                                                                                                    |
| Weakness                     | Memory leak due to not freeing the socket control message (`scm`) structure in the `unix_stream_recvmsg` function when interrupted by a signal.                                                                                            |
| Impact                       | Denial of Service (DoS) - system crashes due to memory exhaustion.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Attack Vectors                | Local - An attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Affected Component            | Linux kernel `unix_stream_recvmsg`                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Fix                         | The patch introduces a call to `scm_destroy(&scm)` within the signal handling block in `unix_stream_recvmsg`, ensuring proper resource deallocation.                                                                                      |
