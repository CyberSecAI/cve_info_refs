Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20225:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a heap out-of-bounds write within the short form option parser in `grub2`. This occurs due to an incorrect calculation of required memory when processing short-form options.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Heap out-of-bounds write: A memory safety issue allowing an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer in the heap. This is triggered during command-line parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Memory corruption: Successful exploitation can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing the system to behave unpredictably, or lead to arbitrary code execution.
- System compromise: Depending on the affected system, the vulnerability can lead to a compromise of data confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
- Denial of Service: Memory corruption can lead to system instability and crash, resulting in Denial of Service.
- Circumvention of Secure Boot: In some configurations, the exploitation could also lead to the circumvention of UEFI Secure Boot.

**Attack vectors:**

- Local Access: The vulnerability is exploitable by a local privileged user. It requires an attacker to be able to influence GRUB2's execution, typically via the GRUB command line.
- Crafted Command: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability using specific, crafted commands that include a large number of short form options.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Privileged access: The attacker needs to be a privileged local user with access to the GRUB2 command line.
- Ability to influence GRUB2 parameters.
