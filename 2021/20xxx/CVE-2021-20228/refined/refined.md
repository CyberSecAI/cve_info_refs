  "CVE-2021-20228": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine prior to 2.10.6rc1, 2.9.18rc1, and 2.8.19rc1, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the `no_log` feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.",
    "Root cause": "The `no_log` feature in Ansible's `basic.py` module did not mask sensitive information when using sub-options, particularly when fallback values or defaults were used.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Sensitive information was not masked by default.",
      "The `no_log` feature failed to protect sensitive information in sub-options.",
       "Default and fallback values for no_log options were not masked properly."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could obtain sensitive information that was not properly masked or protected, leading to a breach of confidentiality.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation can occur over the network.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "No special privileges or user interaction required, indicating that a remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability.",
     "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerability exists in Ansible Engine versions prior to 2.10.6rc1, 2.9.18rc1, and 2.8.19rc1.",
        "The issue is related to how the `no_log` parameter handles suboptions, default values, and fallback mechanisms within the `basic.py` module.",
        "Patches were released in versions 2.10.6rc1, 2.9.18rc1, and 2.8.19rc1.",
         "The fix ensures that default and fallback values for `no_log` options are properly masked.",
         "The vulnerability is classified as High severity, with a CVSS score of 8.7.",
        "The issue is tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla as bug 1925002.",
        "The fix includes changes in `lib/ansible/module_utils/basic.py` to mask default and fallback values for `no_log` options, and new tests in `test/integration/targets/module_utils` to verify the fix.",
         "The fix includes changes to the `_set_defaults` and `_set_fallbacks` functions in `basic.py` to add default and fallback values to the `no_log_values` set when the 'no_log' option is set to True. This set is later used to mask out sensitive values.",
         "The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-200 (Information Exposure) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials)."
