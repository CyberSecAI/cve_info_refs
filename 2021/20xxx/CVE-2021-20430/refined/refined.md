- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from an unmodified deployment of IBM i2 Analyze that communicates unnecessary information, specifically the Liberty default landing page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure. The Liberty default landing page exposes unnecessary information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of potentially sensitive information through the default Liberty landing page.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially access the Liberty default landing page through the network to gather the disclosed information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IBM i2 Analyze deployment.
