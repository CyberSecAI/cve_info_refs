Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20841:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **Improper access control** in the management screen of EC-CUBE 2 series.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Privilege Checks:**  The system fails to properly verify if a user with "store owner" privileges has the authorization to modify system settings, which they should not have.
*   **Incorrect Permission Path Logic**: The application incorrectly determines the permission path, leading to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A user logged in with store owner permissions can alter system settings without proper authorization. This could lead to unauthorized modifications, potentially compromising the application's functionality and security.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with store owner permissions.
*   The attacker would then navigate to the area of the system settings which should not be accessible to them through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid account with "store owner" privileges within the affected EC-CUBE installation.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** EC-CUBE versions 2.11.2 to 2.17.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Workaround:** The provided workaround involves changing the value of `mtb_permission` to the directory name of the management screen URL. This likely corrects the permission path calculation.
*   **Solution:** The vulnerability is addressed in EC-CUBE version 2.17.2 and later. Patches are also available for affected versions.

**Summary**

CVE-2021-20841 is an authorization bypass vulnerability present in EC-CUBE which can be exploited by an attacker with store owner privileges to gain unauthorized access and modify system settings. This is due to improper access control and permission path logic.
