Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2021-20119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure implementation of the password change utility in the Arris SurfBoard SB8200's administration console. The password change process includes client-side validation which can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Client-Side Validation Bypass:** The primary weakness is the reliance on client-side checks to verify the current administrator password before allowing a password change. This check is easily bypassed by crafting a direct POST request to the server without going through the user interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Password Change:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker with a valid user session (not necessarily administrator) to change the administrator password.
*   **Loss of Control:** This could lead to a complete loss of control over the device, as the attacker would then have full administrative access, and any existing user (including the actual admin) would be locked out.
*  **Potential for further malicious activity:** Once the password has been changed, the attacker can modify other device settings, potentially causing further issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the local network where the Arris SurfBoard SB8200 is connected.
*   **HTTP Request Forgery:** The attacker crafts a direct HTTP POST request to the `/changepwd_tab.html` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Network Access:** Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
*   **Valid User Session:** The attacker needs to have an active session in order to execute the attack, which means that they need to have logged into the device already with *any* valid user account.
*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to send HTTP POST requests to manipulate the password.

**Additional details:**
*   The base64 encoded part in the URL (`YWRtaW46c2FwcGhpcmUx`) translates to `admin:sapphire1`. This shows how the password change endpoint is structured but is not itself a vulnerability, but rather an example of the request format.

**Affected Products:**
* Arris SurfBoard SB8200 AB01.02.053.01\_112320\_193.0A.NSH

**CVSS Score:**
* CVSS v3: 7.1 (High) AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* CVSS v2: 4.9 (Medium) AV:A/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P
