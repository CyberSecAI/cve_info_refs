Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-20717

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in EC-CUBE, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue (CWE-79), which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A remote attacker can inject a specially crafted script in a specific input field, leading to arbitrary script execution within the administrator's web browser.
*   **Unauthorized Access and Data Leakage:** Successful exploitation can grant unauthorized access to the vulnerable site, potentially leading to personal information leakage or further malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can initiate the exploit remotely.
*   **Specific Input Field:** The attack requires injecting the malicious script into a specific input field on the EC-CUBE management page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
