Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20288:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the Ceph's authentication mechanism (cephx). Specifically, the monitor daemon, when handling `CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY` requests, fails to properly sanitize the `other_keys` field, which allows for unauthorized reuse of keys. This occurs because Ceph does not enforce the reuse of old keys when generating new ones, enabling an attacker to request a global_id previously associated with another user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insufficient Input Validation:** The monitor daemon does not adequately validate the `other_keys` field during `CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY` requests, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary key data.
2.  **Lack of Key Reuse Enforcement:** Ceph's authentication protocol does not enforce the reuse of existing keys or tickets when generating new ones. This allows an attacker to use a known global ID without proving prior legitimate ownership.
3.  **Missing Global ID Validation:**  The monitor fails to verify that a presented ticket belongs to the entity claiming a given global ID, leading to unauthorized global ID re-use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who possesses a valid authentication key can potentially impersonate other clients by reusing their global ID.
*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** The unauthorized reuse of global IDs could lead to a loss of data confidentiality and integrity because a malicious actor can potentially manipulate data or access resources that are supposed to be protected.
*  **System Availability:** The ability to reuse or steal global IDs can lead to disruption of cluster services, potentially causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Ceph cluster to intercept and replay legitimate client connection attempts.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have some form of valid authentication key or credentials to initiate contact with a monitor.
*   **Client Impersonation:** The attacker has to be able to make `CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY` requests to the monitor with a target global ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker requires a legitimate authentication key within the cluster.
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker has to be on a network that can access the Ceph clusterâ€™s monitors to perform a man in the middle attack and replay packets
*   **Modified Client:**  The attacker needs a modified Ceph client implementation that does not comply with correct behavior of the auth protocol.
*   **Knowledge of Global IDs:** The attacker must have knowledge of a valid global ID to be able to impersonate a client.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability was a re-introduction of a previously fixed vulnerability (CVE-2018-1128), re-emerging in the msgr2 protocol.
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in newer versions of Ceph by requiring a secure key reclaim method.

The provided content offers specific insights into the following:

*   **Red Hat Ceph Storage:** Red Hat acknowledged and addressed the issue across different versions of their Ceph Storage product line, including security advisories (RHSA-2021:2445, RHSA-2022:1394) for their 3 and 4 releases. Patches included fixes in `ceph`, `ceph-ansible` and `tcmu-runner` packages.
*   **Fedora:** Fedora also pushed out fixes for the vulnerability, as demonstrated by the included mailing list messages.
*   **Gentoo:** Gentoo addressed the vulnerability with a security advisory (GLSA 202105-39).
*  **GitHub:** GitHub Security Advisories also has an entry for the issue and is marked with a High severity score.

The fixes and changes to the code are described in detail with associated code commits, pull requests, and issue links. The commits also show that the fix involves modifying the behavior of monitor daemons and implementing a check for the validation of a client's provided ticket with its global\_id in its re-authentication request. Also, the changes include adding mechanisms to detect vulnerable clients and allow administrators to enforce stricter security.
