* #### [rgw/auth: ignoring signatures for HTTP OPTIONS calls](/ceph/ceph/commit/34c71dadba01470d3dc6a2158b5dcab8ea2ab5fc "rgw/auth: ignoring signatures for HTTP OPTIONS calls Before [1] we always sent all HTTP OPTIONS requests to the S3AnonymousEngine and ignored any provided AWSv4 credentials sent in the request. That PR changed so that if we got credentials in the request we instead sent it through the authentication code in order to solve HTTP OPTIONS requests on tenanted users to start working (because we need to resolve the tenant, also called bucket tenant in the code, and we can't only rely on the bucket name since it will not be found). We solved this by modifying the canonical HTTP method used when calculating the AWSv4 signature by instead using the access-control-request-method header which worked good. This change did not take into account that when you generated a presigned URL for a put_object request you can also pass in extra parameters like a canned ACL [2] to the Params variable in for example boto3's generated_presigned_url(). Doing that will cause the client to add the x-amz-acl header to x-amz-signedheaders and also use that in their signature calculation. When doing a HTTP OPTIONS calls for CORS on that presigned URL the browser will never send a x-amz-acl header with the correct data since that is something that the actual PUT request should include later, so that HTTP OPTIONS call should pass even though the signature can never be calculated correctly server-side like verified against AWS S3 in tracker [3]. This patch as a result skips the signature calculation when doing EC2 auth using the LocalEngine but we still need to pass the request there in order to lookup the user to support buckets in a tenant. For the Keystone EC2 auth we're pretty out of luck in the sense that Keystone's API itself requires us to send the AWSv4 signature in the request with the access_key in order to obtain a token, and we cannot leave the signature out, we also cannot spoof the signature from rgw -> keystone since we don't have access to the secret_key if it's not in our cache. For that approach we simply pass on to get_access_token() that if it's an HTTP OPTIONS and we find the access_key in the cache we pull that and ignore verifying signature and pass it on for validation. This means that the cache must be warm if using Keystone auth and adding extra params to a presigned URL. This partly makes some of the commits in [1] redundant for EC2 LocalEngine auth but we still need it for tenanted bucket support.

RocksDB is one of them. in this change, we pass the `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` down in `BuildRocksDB.cmake` so that its `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` contains the same set of `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` used by its parent project. this should help with the performance in the bluestore, where RocksDB is used.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1935406#c0)  John Fulton    2021-03-04 19:55:07 UTC  ``` It has come to our attention that using ansible_* vars that are populated with INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS=True is not very performant. In order to be able to support setting that to off, we need to update the references to use ansible_facts[] instead of ansible_.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1935406#c1)  RHEL Program Management    2021-03-04 19:55:13 UTC  ``` Please specify the severity of this bug.

## Description

An authentication flaw was found in ceph in versions before 14.2.20. When the monitor handles CEPHX\_GET\_AUTH\_SESSION\_KEY requests, it doesn't sanitize other\_keys, allowing key reuse. An attacker who can request a global\_id can exploit the ability of any user to request a global\_id previously associated with another user, as ceph does not force the reuse of old keys to generate new ones. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This could happen if _flush_range(h1) allocated space for file h1 on device (like SLOW) that will not be used when flushing future replay log. Such thing can happen when we have h2 that wrote to WAL and out replay log is on DB. After fsync(h2) we write to replay log, wait for fdatasync on WAL and DB. There is no waiting on SLOW, but h1 was dirty and has been serialized to replay log. Solution is to delay notifying replay log that it has to include h1 after finishing fdatasync.

This is done by tricking replay log to already accept file metadata (size, allocations), but actual data stored in these allocations is not yet synced to disk. Scenario: 1) write to file h1 on SLOW device 2) flush h1 (and trigger h1 mark to be added to bluefs replay log) 3) write to file h2 4) fsync h2 (forces replay log to be written) The result is: - bluefs log now has stable state of h1 - SLOW device is not yet flushed (no fdatasync()) Test detects this condition and fails.

If auth_mon_ticket_ttl is increased by several times as done in
commit 522a52e6c258 (\"auth/cephx: rotate auth tickets less often\"),
active clients eventually get stuck because the monitor sends out an
auth ticket with a bogus validity.  The ticket is secured with the
\"current\" secret that is scheduled to expire according to the old TTL,
but the validity of the ticket is set to the new TTL.  As a result,
the client simply doesn't attempt to renew, letting the secrets rotate
potentially more than once.  When that happens, the client first hits
auth authorizer errors as it tries to renew service tickets and when
it finally gets to renewing the auth ticket, it hits the insecure
global_id reclaim wall.

Cap TTL by expiration of \"next\" key -- the \"current\" key may be
milliseconds away from expiration and still be used, legitimately.
Do it in KeyServerData alongside key rotation code and propagate the
capped TTL to the upper layer.

The second KeyServer::build_session_auth_info() overload is used only
by the monitor, for mon <-> mon authentication.  The monitor passes in
service_secret (mon secret) and secret_id (-1).  The TTL is irrelevant
because there is no rotation.

However the signature doesn't make it obvious.  Clarify that
service_secret and secret_id are input parameters and info is the only
output parameter.

    …

   ```
   This fixes a regression introduced in commit [85157d5](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/85157d5aae3d0ed33c7837193fd69e6c73e37883) ("mon:
   s/Mutex/ceph::mutex/").  Waiting for monmap and config indefinitely
   is not just bad UX, it actually masks other more serious bugs.

    …

   ```
   Eliminate confusion by moving auth from active_con into MonClient
   instead of swapping them.

   The existing MonClient::auth can be destroyed right away -- I don't
   see why active_con would need it or a reason to delay its destruction
   (which is what stashing in active_con effectively does).

3. [mon/MonClient: preserve auth state on reconnects](/ceph/ceph/commit/236b536b28482ec9d8b872de03da7d702ce4787b)
    …

   ```
   Commit [a2eb6ae](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/a2eb6ae3fb57b09efdd4d7baac6871ca8dd8e79f) ("mon/monclient: hunt for multiple monitor in
   parallel") introduced a regression where auth state (global_id and
   AuthClientHandler) was no longer preserved on reconnects.  The ensuing
   breakage was quickly noticed and prompted a follow-on fix [8bb6193](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/8bb6193c8f53d992df8de30c2750c94008171c18)
   ("mon/MonClient: persist global_id across re-connecting").

   However, as evident from the subject, the follow-on fix only took
   care of the global_id part.  AuthClientHandler is still destroyed
   and all cephx tickets are discarded.  A new from-scratch instance
   is created for each MonConnection and CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY
   requests end up with CephXAuthenticate::old_ticket not populated.
   The bug is in MonClient, so both msgr1 and msgr2 are affected.

   This should have resulted in a similar sort of breakage but didn't
   because of a much larger bug.  The monitor should have denied the
   attempt to reclaim global_id with no valid ticket proving previous
   possession of that global_id presented.  Alas, it appears that this
   aspect of the cephx protocol has never been enforced.  This is dealt
   with in the next patch.

   To fix the issue at hand, clone AuthClientHandler into each
   MonConnection so that each respective CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY
   request gets a copy of the current auth ticket.

    …

   ```
   Destroying AuthClientHandler and not resetting global_id is another
   way to get MonClient to send CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY requests with
   CephXAuthenticate::old_ticket not populated.  This is particularly
   pertinent to get_monmap_and_config() which shuts down the bootstrap
   MonClient between retry attempts.

10. [auth/cephx: option to disallow unauthorized global\_id (re)use](/ceph/ceph/commit/abebd643cc60fa8a7cb82dc29a9d5041fb3c3d36)
     …

    ```
    global_id is a cluster-wide unique id that must remain stable for the
    lifetime of the client instance.  The cephx protocol has a facility to
    allow clients to preserve their global_id across reconnects:

    (1) the client should provide its global_id in the initial handshake
        message/frame and later include its auth ticket proving previous
        possession of that global_id in CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY request

    (2) the monitor should verify that the included auth ticket is valid
        and has the same global_id and, if so, allow the reclaim

    (3) if the reclaim is allowed, the new auth ticket should be
        encrypted with the session key of the included auth ticket to
        ensure authenticity of the client performing reclaim.  (The
        included auth ticket could have been snooped when the monitor
        originally shared it with the client or any time the client
        provided it back to the monitor as part of requesting service
        tickets, but only the genuine client would have its session key
        and be able to decrypt.)

    Unfortunately, all (1), (2) and (3) have been broken for a while:

    - (1) was broken in 2016 by commit [a2eb6ae](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/a2eb6ae3fb57b09efdd4d7baac6871ca8dd8e79f) ("mon/monclient:
      hunt for multiple monitor in parallel") and is addressed in patch
      "mon/MonClient: preserve auth state on reconnects"

    - it turns out that (2) has never been enforced.  When cephx was
      being designed and implemented in 2009, two changes to the protocol
      raced with each other pulling it in different directions: commits
      [0669ca2](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/0669ca21f4f784e450068d8b937b37fb0240b595) ("auth: reuse global_id when requesting tickets")
      and [fec3196](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/fec31964a12b82f3d7d3a130b749aee428dbc265) ("auth: when renewing session, encrypt ticket")
      added the reclaim mechanism based strictly on auth tickets, while
      commit [5eeb711](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/5eeb711b6b2beb883d903636b05b89e95066c983) ("auth: change server side negotiation a bit")
      allowed the client to provide global_id in the initial handshake.
      These changes didn't get reconciled and as a result a malicious
      client can assign itself any global_id of its choosing by simply
      passing something other than 0 in MAuth message or AUTH_REQUEST
      frame and not even bother supplying any ticket.  This includes
      getting a global_id that is being used by another client.

    - (3) was broken in 2019 with addition of support for msgr2, where
      the new auth ticket ends up being shared unencrypted.  However the
      root cause is deeper and a malicious client can coerce msgr1 into
      the same.  This also goes back to 2009 and is addressed in patch
      "auth/cephx: ignore CEPH_ENTITY_TYPE_AUTH in requested keys".

    Because (2) has never been enforced, no one noticed when (1) got
    broken and we began to rely on this flaw for normal operation in
    the face of reconnects due to network hiccups or otherwise.  As of
    today, only pre-luminous userspace clients and kernel clients are
    not exercising it on a daily basis.

    Bump CephXAuthenticate version and use a dummy v3 to distinguish
    between legacy clients that don't (may not) include their auth ticket
    and new clients.  For new clients, unconditionally disallow claiming
    global_id without a corresponding auth ticket.  For legacy clients,
    introduce a choice between permissive (current behavior, default for
    the foreseeable future) and enforcing mode.

    If the reclaim is disallowed, return EACCES.  While MonClient does
    have some provision for global_id changes and we could conceivably
    implement enforcement by handing out a fresh global_id instead of
    the provided one, those code paths have never been tested and there
    are too many ways a sudden global_id change could go wrong.

11. [mon: fail fast when unauthorized global\_id (re)use is disallowed](/ceph/ceph/commit/08766a17edebb7450cd9b17cc2dc01efc068bb94)
     …

    ```
    When unauthorized global_id (re)use is disallowed, we don't want to
    let unpatched clients in because they wouldn't be able to reestablish
    their monitor session later, resulting in subtle hangs and disrupted
    user workloads.

    Denying the initial connect for all legacy (CephXAuthenticate < v3)
    clients is not feasible because a large subset of them never stopped
    presenting their ticket on reconnects and are therefore compatible with
    enforcing mode: most notably all kernel clients but also pre-luminous
    userspace clients.  They don't need to be patched and excluding them
    would significantly hamper the adoption of enforcing mode.

    Instead, force clients that we are not sure about to reconnect shortly
    after they go through authentication and obtain global_id.  This is
    done in Monitor::dispatch_op() to capture both msgr1 and msgr2, most
    likely instead of dispatching mon_subscribe.

    We need to let mon_getmap through for "ceph ping" and "ceph tell" to
    work.  This does mean that we share the monmap, which lets the client
    return from MonClient::authenticate() considering authentication to be
    finished and causing the potential reconnect error to not propagate to
    the user -- the client would hang waiting for remaining cluster maps.
    For msgr1, this is unavoidable because the monmap is sent immediately
    after the final MAuthReply.  But for msgr2 this is rare: most of the
    time we get to their mon_subscribe and cut the connection before they
    process the monmap!

    Regardless, the user doesn't get a chance to start a workload since
    there is no proper higher-level session at that point.

    To help with identifying clients that need patching, add global_id and
    global_id_status to "sessions" output.

     …

    ```
    If unauthorized global_id (re)use is disallowed, a client that has
    been disconnected from the network long enough for keys to rotate
    and its auth ticket to expire (i.e. become invalid/unverifiable)
    would not be able to reconnect.

    The default TTL is 12 hours, resulting in a 12-24 hour reconnect
    window (the previous key is kept around, so the actual window can be
    up to double the TTL).  The setting has stayed the same since 2009,
    but it also hasn't been enforced.  Bump it to get a 72 hour reconnect
    window to cover for something breaking on Friday and not getting fixed
    until Monday.

     …

    ```
    When handling CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY requests from nautilus+
    clients, ignore CEPH_ENTITY_TYPE_AUTH in CephXAuthenticate::other_keys.
    Similarly, when handling CEPHX_GET_PRINCIPAL_SESSION_KEY requests,
    ignore CEPH_ENTITY_TYPE_AUTH in CephXServiceTicketRequest::keys.
    These fields are intended for requesting service tickets, the auth
    ticket (which is really a ticket granting ticket) must not be shared
    this way.

    Otherwise we end up sharing an auth ticket that a) isn't encrypted
    with the old session key even if needed (should_enc_ticket == true)
    and b) has the wrong validity, namely auth_service_ticket_ttl instead
    of auth_mon_ticket_ttl.  In the CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY case, this
    undue ticket immediately supersedes the actual auth ticket already
    encoded in the same reply (the reply frame ends up containing two auth
    tickets).

Debian Bug     : 1053690

Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in Ceph, a massively scalable,
open-source, distributed storage system that runs on commodity hardware
and delivers object, block and file system storage.

CVE-2019-10222

    A Denial of service was fixed: An unauthenticated attacker could crash
    the Ceph RGW server by sending valid HTTP headers and terminating the
    connection, resulting in a remote denial of service for Ceph RGW clients.

CVE-2020-1700

    A Denial of Service was fixed: A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW
    Beast front-end handles unexpected disconnects. An authenticated attacker
    can abuse this flaw by making multiple disconnect attempts resulting in a
    permanent leak of a socket connection by radosgw. This flaw could lead to
    a denial of service condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually
    leading to the exhaustion of available resources, preventing legitimate
    users from connecting to the system.

CVE-2020-1760

    A XSS attack was fixed: A flaw was found in the Ceph Object Gateway,
    where it supports request sent by an anonymous user in Amazon S3.
    This flaw could lead to potential XSS attacks due to the lack
    of proper neutralization of untrusted input.

CVE-2020-10753

    A Header Injection attack was fixed: It was possible to
    inject HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag in an Amazon S3 bucket. The
    newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file
    generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is
    made.

CVE-2020-12059

    A Denial of Service was fixed: A POST request with an invalid tagging
    XML could crash the RGW process by triggering a NULL pointer exception.

CVE-2020-25678

    An Information Disclosure was fixed: ceph stores mgr module passwords
    in clear text. This can be found by searching the mgr logs for grafana and
    dashboard, with passwords visible.

CVE-2020-27781

    A Privilege Escalation was fixed: User credentials could be manipulated
    and stolen by Native CephFS consumers of OpenStack Manila, resulting in
    potential privilege escalation. An Open Stack Manila user can request
    access to a share to an arbitrary cephx user, including existing users.
    The access key is retrieved via the interface drivers. Then, all users of
    the requesting OpenStack project can view the access key. This enables the
    attacker to target any resource that the user has access to. This can be
    done to even "admin" users, compromising the ceph administrator.

CVE-2021-3524

    Similar to CVE-2020-10753, a Header Injection attack was fixed:
    It was possible to inject HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader
    tag in an Amazon S3 bucket

CVE-2021-3531

    A Denial of Service was fixed: When processing a GET Request in Ceph
    Storage RGW for a swift URL that ends with two slashes it could cause the
    rgw to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3979

    A Loss of Confidentiality was fixed: A key length flaw was found in
    Ceph Storage. An attacker could exploit the fact that the key length is
    incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key,
    which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and
    integrity on encrypted disks.

CVE-2021-20288

    A Potential Privilege Escalation was fixed: When handling
    CEPHX_GET_PRINCIPAL_SESSION_KEY requests, ignore CEPH_ENTITY_TYPE_AUTH in
    CephXServiceTicketRequest::keys.

CVE-2023-43040

    A flaw was found in Ceph RGW. An unprivileged
    user can write to any bucket(s) accessible by a given key
    if a POST's form-data contains a key called 'bucket'
    with a value matching the name of the bucket used to sign
    the request. The result of this is that a user could actually
    upload to any bucket accessible by the specified access key
    as long as the bucket in the POST policy matches the bucket
    in said POST form part.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
12.2.11+dfsg1-2.1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ceph packages.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# CVE-2021-20288: Unauthorized global\_id reuse in cephx[](#cve-2021-20288-unauthorized-global-id-reuse-in-cephx "Permalink to this heading")

* [NIST information page](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20288)

## Summary[](#summary "Permalink to this heading")

Ceph was not ensuring that reconnecting/renewing clients were
presenting an existing ticket when reclaiming their global\_id value.
An attacker that was able to authenticate could claim a global\_id in
use by a different client and potentially disrupt
other cluster services.

## Background[](#background "Permalink to this heading")

Each authenticated client or daemon in Ceph is assigned a numeric
global\_id identifier. That value is assumed to be unique across the
cluster. When clients reconnect to the monitor (e.g., due to a
network disconnection) or renew their ticket, they are supposed to
present their old ticket to prove prior possession of their global\_id
so that it can be reclaimed and thus remain constant over the lifetime
of that client instance.

Ceph was not correctly checking that the old ticket was valid, allowing
an arbitrary global\_id to be reclaimed, even if it was in use by another
active client in the system.

## Attacker Requirements[](#attacker-requirements "Permalink to this heading")

Any potential attacker must:

* have a valid authentication key for the cluster
* know or guess the global\_id of another client
* run a modified version of the Ceph client code to reclaim another client’s global\_id
* construct appropriate client messages or requests to disrupt service or exploit
  Ceph daemon assumptions about global\_id uniqueness

## Impact[](#impact "Permalink to this heading")

### Confidentiality Impact[](#confidentiality-impact "Permalink to this heading")

None

### Integrity Impact[](#integrity-impact "Permalink to this heading")

Partial. An attacker could potentially exploit assumptions around
global\_id uniqueness to disrupt other clients’ access or disrupt
Ceph daemons.

### Availability Impact[](#availability-impact "Permalink to this heading")

High. An attacker could potentially exploit assumptions around
global\_id uniqueness to disrupt other clients’ access or disrupt
Ceph daemons.

### Access Complexity[](#access-complexity "Permalink to this heading")

High. The client must make use of modified client code in order to
exploit specific assumptions in the behavior of other Ceph daemons.

### Authentication[](#authentication "Permalink to this heading")

Yes. The attacker must also be authenticated and have access to the
same services as a client it is wishing to impersonate or disrupt.

### Gained Access[](#gained-access "Permalink to this heading")

Partial. An attacker can partially impersonate another client.

## Affected versions[](#affected-versions "Permalink to this heading")

All prior versions of Ceph monitors fail to ensure that global\_id reclaim
attempts are authentic.

In addition, all user-space daemons and clients starting from Luminous v12.2.0
were failing to securely reclaim their global\_id following commit a2eb6ae3fb57
(“mon/monclient: hunt for multiple monitor in parallel”).

All versions of the Linux kernel client properly authenticate.

## Fixed versions[](#fixed-versions "Permalink to this heading")

* Pacific v16.2.1 (and later)
* Octopus v15.2.11 (and later)
* Nautilus v14.2.20 (and later)

## Fix details[](#fix-details "Permalink to this heading")

1. Patched monitors now properly require that clients securely reclaim
   their global\_id when the `auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim`
   is `false`. Initially, by default, this option is set to
   `true` so that existing clients can continue to function without
   disruption until all clients have been upgraded. When this option
   is set to false, then an unpatched client will not be able to reconnect
   to the cluster after an intermittent network disruption breaking
   its connect to a monitor, or be able to renew its authentication
   ticket when it times out (by default, after 72 hours).

   Patched monitors raise the `AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM_ALLOWED`
   health alert if `auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim` is enabled.
   This health alert can be muted with:

   ```
   ceph health mute AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM_ALLOWED 1w

   ```

   Although it is not recommended, the alert can also be disabled with:

   ```
   ceph config set mon mon_warn_on_insecure_global_id_reclaim_allowed false

   ```
2. Patched monitors can disconnect new clients right after they have
   authenticated (forcing them to reconnect and reclaim) in order to
   determine whether they securely reclaim global\_ids. This allows
   the cluster and users to discover quickly whether clients would be
   affected by requiring secure global\_id reclaim: most clients will
   report an authentication error immediately. This behavior can be
   disabled by setting `auth_expose_insecure_global_id_reclaim` to
   `false`:

   ```
   ceph config set mon auth_expose_insecure_global_id_reclaim false

   ```
3. Patched monitors will raise the `AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM` health
   alert for any clients or daemons that are not securely reclaiming their
   global\_id. These clients should be upgraded before disabling the
   `auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim` option to avoid disrupting
   client access.

   By default (if `auth_expose_insecure_global_id_reclaim` has not
   been disabled), clients’ failure to securely reclaim global\_id will
   immediately be exposed and raise this health alert.
   However, if `auth_expose_insecure_global_id_reclaim` has been
   disabled, this alert will not be triggered for a client until it is
   forced to reconnect to a monitor (e.g., due to a network disruption)
   or the client renews its authentication ticket (by default, after
   72 hours).
4. The default time-to-live (TTL) for authentication tickets has been increased
   from 12 hours to 72 hours. Because we previously were not ensuring that
   a client’s prior ticket was valid when reclaiming their global\_id, a client
   could tolerate a network outage that lasted longer than the ticket TTL and still
   reclaim its global\_id. Once the cluster starts requiring secure global\_id reclaim,
   a client that is disconnected for longer than the TTL may fail to reclaim its global\_id,
   fail to reauthenticate, and be unable to continue communicating with the cluster
   until it is restarted. The default TTL was increased to minimize the impact of this
   change on users.

## Recommendations[](#recommendations "Permalink to this heading")

1. Users should upgrade to a patched version of Ceph at their earliest
   convenience.
2. Users should upgrade any unpatched clients at their earliest
   convenience. By default, these clients can be easily identified by
   checking the `ceph health detail` output for the
   `AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM` alert.
3. If all clients cannot be upgraded immediately, the health alerts can be
   temporarily muted with:

   ```
   ceph health mute AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM 1w  # 1 week
   ceph health mute AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM_ALLOWED 1w  # 1 week

   ```
4. After all clients have been updated and the `AUTH_INSECURE_GLOBAL_ID_RECLAIM`
   alert is no longer present, the cluster should be set to prevent insecure
   global\_id reclaim with:

   ```
   ceph config set mon auth_allow_insecure_global_id_reclaim false

   ```

However it still fires if the predecessor is there but happens to be a primary demotion snapshot. A bogus \"incomplete local non-primary snapshot\" error is reported and the replayer gets stuck. Remove completed_non_primary_snapshots_exist tracking as the presence of the predecessor in the incomplete non-primary snapshot pruning arm is already ensured by \"m_local_snap_id_start > 0\" condition.

| [Description](#c0)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-12-20 07:53:33 UTC  ``` CVE-2020-25660:  A flaw was found in the Cephx authentication protocol in versions before 15.2.6 and before 14.2.14, where it does not verify Ceph clients correctly and is then vulnerable to replay attacks in Nautilus. This flaw allows an attacker with access to the Ceph cluster network to authenticate with the Ceph service via a packet sniffer and perform actions allowed by the Ceph service. This issue is a reintroduction of CVE-2018-1128, affecting the msgr2 protocol. The msgr 2 protocol is used for all communication except older clients that do not support the msgr2 protocol. The msgr1 protocol is not affected. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.   Maintainers, please proceed with stabilization when ready. ```   [Comment 1](#c1)  NATTkA bot   gentoo-dev  2020-12-20 07:56:57 UTC  Comment hidden (obsolete)  ``` Sanity check failed:  > sys-cluster/ceph-14.2.15 >   depend amd64 dev profile default/linux/amd64/17.0/no-multilib/prefix/kernel-3.2+ (2 total) >     dev-libs/rocksdb:= >   depend amd64 stable profile default/linux/amd64/17.1 (14 total) >     dev-libs/rocksdb:= >   rdepend amd64 dev profile default/linux/amd64/17.0/no-multilib/prefix/kernel-3.2+ (2 total) >     dev-libs/rocksdb:= >   rdepend amd64 stable profile default/linux/amd64/17.1 (14 total) >     dev-libs/rocksdb:= ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  NATTkA bot   gentoo-dev  2020-12-27 19:08:58 UTC  ``` All sanity-check issues have been resolved ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-12-27 19:32:00 UTC  ``` We'll actually need to stabilize a newer version for the dependency. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2021-05-24 14:36:20 UTC  ``` CVE-2020-1759: ============== Upstream commit: <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/f6c5ad8a5f534d73cba9c6bd794a89e879c46ecc>  Fixed in >=14.2.9  CVE-2020-1760: ============== Upstream commit: <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/c7da604cb101cbe78a257a29498a98c69964e0a6>  Fixed in >=14.2.9  CVE-2020-10753: =============== Upstream issue: <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/35773> Upstream commit: <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/46817f30cee60bc5df8354ab326762e7c783fe2c>  Fixed in >=14.2.10  CVE-2020-25660:  Fixed in >=14.2.14   New GLSA request filed. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2021-05-26 20:58:44 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 202105-39 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-39> by GLSA coordinator Thomas Deutschmann (whissi). ``` |  |

When the monitor handles CEPHX\_GET\_AUTH\_SESSION\_KEY requests, it doesn't sanitize other\_keys, allowing key reuse. An attacker who can request a global\_id can exploit the ability of any user to request a global\_id previously associated with another user, as ceph does not force the reuse of old keys to generate new ones. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2021-06-15 21:03:59 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | ceph config set global mon\_data\_size\_warn <size> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | AUTH\_INSECURE\_GLOBAL\_ID\_RECLAIM |
|  |  | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | One or more clients or daemons are connected to the cluster that are |
|  |  | not securely reclaiming their global\_id (a unique number identifying |
|  |  | each entity in the cluster) when reconnecting to a monitor. The |
|  |  | client is being permitted to connect anyway because the |
|  |  | ``auth\_allow\_insecure\_global\_id\_reclaim`` option is set to true (which may |
|  |  | be necessary until all ceph clients have been upgraded), and the |
|  |  | ``auth\_expose\_insecure\_global\_id\_reclaim`` option set to ``true`` (which |
|  |  | allows monitors to detect clients with insecure reclaim early by forcing them to |
|  |  | reconnect right after they first authenticate). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | You can identify which client(s) are using unpatched ceph client code with:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ceph health detail |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Clients global\_id reclaim rehavior can also seen in the |
|  |  | ``global\_id\_status`` field in the dump of clients connected to an |
|  |  | individual monitor (``reclaim\_insecure`` means the client is |
|  |  | unpatched and is contributing to this health alert):: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ceph tell mon.\\* sessions |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | We strongly recommend that all clients in the system are upgraded to a |
|  |  | newer version of Ceph that correctly reclaims global\_id values. Once |
|  |  | all clients have been updated, you can stop allowing insecure reconnections |
|  |  | with:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ceph config set mon auth\_allow\_insecure\_global\_id\_reclaim false |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If it is impractical to upgrade all clients immediately, you can silence |
|  |  | this warning temporarily with:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ceph health mute AUTH\_INSECURE\_GLOBAL\_ID\_RECLAIM 1w # 1 week |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Although we do NOT recommend doing so, you can also disable this warning indefinitely |
|  |  | with:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ceph config set mon mon\_warn\_on\_insecure\_global\_id\_reclaim false |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | AUTH\_INSECURE\_GLOBAL\_ID\_RECLAIM\_ALLOWED |
|  |  | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Ceph is currently configured to allow clients to reconnect to monitors using |
|  |  | an insecure process to reclaim their previous global\_id because the setting |
|  |  | ``auth\_allow\_insecure\_global\_id\_reclaim`` is set to ``true``. It may be necessary to |
|  |  | leave this setting enabled while existing Ceph clients are upgraded to newer |
|  |  | versions of Ceph that correctly and securely reclaim their global\_id. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If the ``AUTH\_INSECURE\_GLOBAL\_ID\_RECLAIM`` health alert has not also been raised and |
|  |  | the ``auth\_expose\_insecure\_global\_id\_reclaim`` setting has not been disabled (it is |
|  |  | on by default), then there are currently no clients connected that need to be |
|  |  | upgraded, and it is safe to disallow insecure global\_id reclaim with:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ceph config set mon auth\_allow\_insecure\_global\_id\_reclaim false |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If there are still clients that need to be upgraded, then this alert can be |
|  |  | silenced temporarily with:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ceph health mute AUTH\_INSECURE\_GLOBAL\_ID\_RECLAIM\_ALLOWED 1w # 1 week |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Although we do NOT recommend doing so, you can also disable this warning indefinitely |
|  |  | with:: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ceph config set mon mon\_warn\_on\_insecure\_global\_id\_reclaim\_allowed false |

## Topic

An update for ceph, ceph-ansible, ceph-iscsi, python-waitress, and tcmu-runner is now available for Red Hat Ceph Storage 4.2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a Ceph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.

The ceph-ansible package provides Ansible playbooks for installing, maintaining, and upgrading Red Hat Ceph Storage.

The tcmu-runner packages provide a service that handles the complexity of the LIO kernel target's userspace passthrough interface (TCMU). It presents a C plugin API for extension modules that handle SCSI requests in ways not possible or suitable to be handled by LIO's in-kernel backstores.

Security Fix(es):

* ceph: Unauthorized global\_id reuse in cephx (CVE-2021-20288)
* ceph-dashboard: Don't use Browser's LocalStorage for storing JWT but Secure Cookies with proper HTTP Headers (CVE-2020-27839)
* ceph-dashboard: Cross-site scripting via token Cookie (CVE-2021-3509)
