- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) web application does not properly encode error messages sent back to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper output encoding leading to potential information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure that could be leveraged in phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: By triggering an error in the ISIQ web application, an attacker can receive improperly encoded status messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to interact with the ISIQ web application in a way that triggers an error, no special capabilities are mentioned.
