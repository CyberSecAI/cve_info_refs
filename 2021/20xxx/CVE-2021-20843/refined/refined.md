Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a cross-site script inclusion (XSSI) vulnerability in the web-based management interface (Web GUI) of certain Yamaha routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-site Script Inclusion (XSSI) (CWE-829):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include malicious scripts from external sources into the context of the router's Web GUI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Settings Modification:** By tricking an administrator into visiting a malicious webpage while logged into the router's Web GUI, an attacker can modify the router's settings. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, such as DNS changes, port forwarding alterations, or other configuration manipulations.
* **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The router's configuration could be read and potentially used to compromise the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Webpage:** The attacker crafts a malicious webpage that contains the XSSI payload.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator of the vulnerable router to visit the malicious page. This could be done through phishing attacks, drive-by downloads, or other social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **External:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet.
*   **Low Privilege:** The attacker does not need high privileges on the router itself but needs to trick a valid administrator.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to trick a user with access to the router's management interface into visiting a malicious webpage.

**Affected Products:**

*   Yamaha RTX830 (Rev. 15.02.17 and earlier)
*   Yamaha NVR510 (Rev. 15.01.18 and earlier)
*   Yamaha NVR700W (Rev. 15.00.19 and earlier)
*   Yamaha RTX1210 (Rev. 14.01.38 and earlier)
*  NTT-West Biz Box routers which are re-branded versions of the above Yamaha routers.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Firmware Update:** Updating to the latest firmware version (RTX830 Rev.15.02.20, NVR510 Rev.15.01.21, NVR700W Rev.15.00.22, RTX1210 Rev.14.01.40 or later) is the primary solution.
*   **Workarounds (if firmware update isn't feasible):**
    *   Disable the HTTP server feature (`httpd service off`).
    *   Restrict access to the Web GUI from all hosts (`httpd host none`).

**Additional Notes:**
* This vulnerability is often paired with CVE-2021-20844, which is a HTTP Response Header Injection vulnerability found in the same devices.
*   The provided information includes advisories from both Yamaha and NTT-West, indicating they are affected.

This detailed information goes beyond the placeholder description in the initial CVE and provides actionable details about the nature of the vulnerability, its impact, and how to remediate it.
