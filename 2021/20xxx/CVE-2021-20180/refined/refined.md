{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `bitbucket_pipeline_variable` Ansible module was not properly masking sensitive information like credentials by default, and it did not respect the `no_log` feature.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Credentials such as secrets are disclosed in the console log by default.",
      "The `no_log` feature, intended to prevent sensitive information from being logged, is not respected by the `bitbucket_pipeline_variable` module."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially steal Bitbucket pipeline credentials by gaining access to the playbook execution output, which exposes the secrets by default.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs access to the playbook execution output where credentials are leaked. This could be through access to the logs, console output or any other medium where Ansible output is visible.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs access to the output of the Ansible playbook execution. The attacker does not need privileged access on the target system to exploit this vulnerability."
