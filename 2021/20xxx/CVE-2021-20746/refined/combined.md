# WordPress Popular Posts 5.3: Improved PHP 8 Support, Retina Display Support, and more!

Version 5.3 introduces PHP 8 support, sharper thumbnails for retina displays, improved Polylang support, and a few other minor improvements and fixes.

After months in the making, version 5.3 is finally available for everyone!

This version includes some nice updates and needed fixes. Check out below what 5.3 brings to you.

## PHP 8 Support

By the end of November 2020 PHP 8 was officially released to the public, including new features like the Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler and many other interesting new additions / improvements. The Kinsta team wrote a more in-depth blog post about it in case you’re feeling curious: [What’s New in PHP 8 (Features, Improvements, and the JIT Compiler)](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-8/).

![PHP usage chart as of April 2021](https://cabrerahector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wordpress-statistics-php-8-adoption.jpg)

As of June 2021 only around 0.3% of all of the WordPress websites out there have updated to PHP 8 (see [WordPress Statistics](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/)).

Early adopters were kind enough to reach out to me to notify that the plugin needed a couple of changes for it to be fully compatible with PHP 8. So here you go 😛

## Block Editor (a.k.a. Gutenberg) Support

Version 5.3.4 also brings **Gutenberg support**! There’s a brand new **WordPress Popular Posts block** that can be used inside the [Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-block-editor/) and on the [new Widgets screen](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-based-widgets-editor/) introduced with WordPress 5.8.

<https://cabrerahector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/widgets-screen-wordpress-popular-posts-block.mp4>

~~The WordPress Popular Posts block is still considered pretty much as experimental because it’s not as mature feature wise as the good ol’ WordPress Popular Posts widget~~.

The WordPress Popular Posts block is now on par feature wise with the classic WordPress Popular Posts widget. People using the classic widget and WordPress 5.0 or newer should migrate to the WordPress Popular Posts block as soon as possible.

~~While it can do most of the things the classic widget can, the WPP block still needs some work:~~

* ~~It’s not compatible with caching plugins yet: your popular posts list will remain static until the next time your site’s cache gets regenerated.~~ Fixed on [version 5.4.0](https://cabrerahector.com/wordpress/wordpress-popular-posts-5-4-widget-block-improvements-plus-prep-work-for-csp-support/#page-cache-support).
* ~~Needs some more tweaking to get the same (or better) out-of-the-box level of compatibility with WordPress themes as its predecessor, the classic widget.~~
* ~~Polylang / WPML are not supported yet.~~ Fixed on [version 5.4.0](https://cabrerahector.com/wordpress/wordpress-popular-posts-5-4-widget-block-improvements-plus-prep-work-for-csp-support/#polylang-wpml-support).
* ~~Possibly other things, you tell me.~~

~~Due to the reasons stated above the WPP block isn’t enabled by default yet.~~

~~If you want to try it out please head to **Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > Tools**, tick the **Enable experimental features** checkbox located under **Miscellaneous**, and then click on **Apply** to save changes. With that you’ll be able to find the new WordPress Popular Posts widget block on both the Block Editor screen and the new Widgets screen.~~

[Version 5.4.0 enables the WPP block for everyone](https://cabrerahector.com/wordpress/wordpress-popular-posts-5-4-widget-block-improvements-plus-prep-work-for-csp-support/#block-no-longer-experimental), please update as soon as possible.

Note that the WPP block has only been tested on WordPress 5.7 and newer. If you’re on an older version of WordPress you may need to upgrade to at least version 5.7 in order to be able to use it.
## Overriding Widget Theme Stylesheets

[Widget themes](https://cabrerahector.com/wordpress/wordpress-popular-posts-5-0-multiple-taxonomy-support-themes-thumbnail-lazy-loading-and-more/#themes) is a feature introduced with WordPress Popular Posts 5.0 that basically allows you to apply predefined layouts to your popular posts list.

![](https://cabrerahector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wordpress-popular-posts-card-theme.png)

Until now, if you wanted to make some changes to a specific theme (eg. change the color of links, use a different font family, etc.) you had to use PHP and hook into [wpp\_additional\_theme\_styles](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/3.-Filters#wpp_additional_theme_styles) to add your own CSS rules. Not very practical if you’re not familiar with PHP in general, right?

Starting version 5.3, you can also just copy the folder of the widget theme you wish to customize into your WordPress theme directory, then any changes made to your copy of the widget theme will persist across future updates (as long as there are no breaking changes within the widget theme of course).

For more details: [Customizing an existing WordPress Popular Posts widget theme](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/6.-Styling-the-list#customizing-an-existing-theme).

## New filter hook: wpp\_post\_meta\_separator

This version also introduces a new filter hook called [wpp\_post\_meta\_separator](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/3.-Filters#wpp_post_meta_separator) that lets you change the separator the plugin uses to divide the statistics of your post (views count, comment count, etc.)

![](https://cabrerahector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wpp-post-meta-separator.png)

Not a life changing feature, I know, but it’s nice to have.

## Retina Display Support

Retina displays are displays that have a higher pixel density than regular displays. This allows the screen to display text and images in more detail, improving the viewing experience.

Here’s how WordPress Popular Posts’s thumbnails looked on a Retina display before adding this feature vs how it looks after:

[![Image Retina Support Off vs On](https://cabrerahector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-retina-support-off-vs-on.jpg)](https://cabrerahector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-retina-support-off-vs-on.jpg)

Quite the difference, huh?

(The screen capture looks a bit pixelated due to the plugin I’m using to optimize images on this website but trust me it looks better.)

This feature is enabled by default. If you want to disable it there’s a new filter hook called [wpp\_retina\_support](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/3.-Filters#wpp_retina_support) that you can use to do so.

Note that you may need to clear WPP’s thumbnail cache first (**Settings > WordPress Popular Posts > Tools**, under **Thumbnails**) so the plugin can generate the images required for retina support.

## wpp\_get\_views() can now return views count from custom time ranges

Up until now the [wpp\_get\_views()](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags#wpp_get_views) template tag returned the views count of a post within a fixed time range: all, last 24 hours, last 7 days, and last 30 days. If you wanted to retrieve the views count of a post within the last hour, for example, you couldn’t do so using this function.

Version 5.3.0 introduces the ability to pass an array as the second parameter instead of a string so you can specify a custom time range:

```

<?php
if ( function_exists('wpp_get_views') ) {
    echo wpp_get_views(
        get_the_ID(),
        [
            'range' => 'custom', /* accepted values: all, last24hours, last7days, last30days, custom */
            'time_unit' => 'hour', /* accepted values: minute, hour, day, month */
            'time_quantity' => 1
        ]
    );
}

```
## Improved Polylang / WPML support

There were some bugs reported by the community that were affecting WPP’s integration with Polylang and WPML (mostly Polylang though.) This release fixes most of these issues so if you’re using either of these plugins in conjunction with WordPress Popular Posts you should definitely update as soon as possible.

## Minor Updates & Hotfixes

### 5.3.6

Version 5.3.6, released on July 21st, 2021, fixes a vulnerability identified and responsibly disclosed by the pluginvulnerabilities.com team. This issue affects the [[wpp] shortcode](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-%26-pages), if you’re using it on your website please make sure to test your shortcode with version 5.3.6 on a [development environment](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-staging-environment-for-a-wordpress-site/) first to make sure that it still works as intended before updating to 5.3.6 on your live website.

This release also fixes an issue where the classic WordPress Popular Posts widget won’t output its title under certain conditions. Thanks Okoth1 and others for reporting this issue!

Finally, with the official release of WordPress 5.8 -launched on July 20th- there was what it seems a last-minute change that started triggering a PHP notice on the new Widgets screen. This has been fixed as well.

#### About the WordPress 5.8 update and the classic WPP widget

As of WordPress 5.8.0 the classic WordPress Popular Posts widget doesn’t work very well / at all with the [new Widgets screen](https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/tatum/). I may or may not work on improving its compatibility with this new Widgets screen, especially considering the fact that now we have a brand new [WordPress Popular Posts block](#block-editor-support) that does work with it and that will likely end up replacing the classic widget entirely in the future.

For the time being, if you prefer / need to use the classic WordPress Popular Posts widget and you have WordPress 5.8 (or newer) please install the [Classic Widgets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/) plugin to restore the old Widgets screen so you can use WordPress widgets as you were used to before WordPress 5.8 came out.

### 5.3.5

Version **5.3.5**, released on July 4th, 2021, fixes a character encoding issue affecting the display of some characters on languages like Spanish, German, Japanese, etc. and also fixes a PHP fatal error that affected some websites. If you’re using WordPress Popular Posts 5.3.4 or older you should update to version 5.3.5 (or newer) as soon as possible (here’s [how to update a WordPress plugin](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/manually-update-wordpress-plugin/) in case you need assistance with this).

This release also rolls back some of the security enhancements introduced with version 5.3.4. These changes were meant to reduce the chances of someone with administrative privileges to inject malicious JavaScript code into the site, however this caused some issues for some websites (garbled output & layout issues for some). Obviously there are some (edge?) use cases out there that I didn’t consider when implementing these changes. Since it did more harm than the good it was intended to do I decided to revert this change with version 5.3.5.

In hindsight, the plugin has always relied on users managing their websites responsibly, granting administrator privileges only to people they trust or have vetted to at least some extent and so WordPress Popular Posts is not going to monitor what these users do. It’s not really its job.

Note that the patch that fixes the reported XSS vulnerability is still included with version 5.3.5 so don’t worry, your website’s security is not being compromised in any way with this release.

### 5.3.4

Version **5.3.4**, released on July 3rd, 2021, patches a potential security vulnerability and so if you’re using WordPress Popular Posts 5.3.3 or older you should update to version 5.3.4 (or newer) as soon as possible (here’s [how to update a WordPress plugin](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/manually-update-wordpress-plugin/) in case you need assistance with this).

An user that goes by the alias *Visse* reached out to report an authenticated stored [Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) that could allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

The reported vulnerability requires the attacker to be logged in and also to have Administrator privileges. This shouldn’t be an issue for most people out there since common sense dictates that you should only grant administrative privileges to **trusted users**, however the plugin will now make sure that not even someone with high privileges can abuse it.

This version also includes a few additional security enhancements to further reduce the risk of misuse by malicious actors. Visse also proved to be a big help with this so big shout-out to him!

Note though that these changes might unfortunately affect some sites, especially those that are using customized popular posts lists, so if in doubt consider testing this version on a development environment (like a [staging website](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-staging-environment-for-a-wordpress-site/) for example) before updating to 5.3.4 on your live website.

Not everything about this release is security related though: version 5.3.4 also introduces the first WordPress Popular Posts block. This wasn’t really planned and the block is still pretty much a work-in-progress but figured I could share a sneak peek. Check [Block Support](#block-editor-support) for more details.

### 5.3.3

Version **5.3.3**, released on June 4th, 2021, patches two potential security vulnerabilities and so if you’re using WordPress Popular Posts 5.3.2 or older you should update to version 5.3.3 (or newer) as soon as possible (here’s [how to update a WordPress plugin](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/manually-update-wordpress-plugin/) in case you need assistance with this).

The [JPCERT/CC Vulnerability Coordination Group](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) reported a potential [Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) discovered by researcher Yu Iwama (Secure Sky Technology Inc.) Said vulnerability can be exploited only if the attacker is logged in and has at least Author privileges along with other conditions.

Additionally, a potential [Code Injection vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection) was reported by Jerome from [NinTechNet](https://nintechnet.com/). To take advantage of it the attacker must be logged in and have at least Contributor privileges, and also additional specific conditions must be met as well making this particular vulnerability more difficult to exploit (but not impossible).

Version 5.3.3 also fixes a couple of issues that prevented the correct loading of posts thumbnails when SSL/HTTPS isn’t correctly installed on the website or when using specific PHP locales. If you’re using a caching plugin (or if your hosting provider, eg. SiteGround/WPEngine, provides their own page caching mechanism) you should clear its cache so these fixes can be applied to your website right away.

Lastly, 5.3.3 updates ChartJS (the script WPP uses to display that nice views/comments count per day chart) to version 2.9.4.

As a side note, this is likely the last version of the plugin that will support Internet Explorer 11. The WordPress team plans to [drop IE support entirely once version WP 5.8 is released](https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/dropping-support-for-internet-explorer-11/) and so it makes little sense for WordPress Popular Posts to continue providing support for it. If you have strong reasons why I should reconsider feel free to leave a comment below so we and anyone interested can talk about it.

### 5.3.2

Version **5.3.2**, released on April 21th, 2021, fixes an issue where [wpp\_get\_views()](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags#wpp_get_views) would return 0 views under certain conditions (thanks to everyone who helped with this!)

### 5.3.1

Version **5.3.1**, released on April 20th, 2021, fixes an issue where [wpp\_get\_views()](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags#wpp_get_views) would return last 24 hours views count instead of total views count when time range wasn’t set by the user (thanks @narolles for the report!) This version also enables the Ajaxify widget option by default for new installs for better compatibility with caching plugins.

* **[WP-PostRatings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-postratings/) support** – Show your visitors how your readers are rating your posts!

#### PSA: The classic WordPress Popular Posts widget has reached End-of-Life

The classic WordPress Popular Posts widget doesn’t work very well / at all with the new Widgets screen introduced with WordPress 5.8.

This new Widgets screen expects WordPress blocks instead of regular WordPress widgets. If you’re using the classic WordPress Popular Posts widget please replace it with the [WordPress Popular Posts block](https://cabrerahector.com/wordpress/wordpress-popular-posts-5-3-improved-php-8-support-retina-display-support-and-more/#block-editor-support) instead – it has the same features and functionality as the “classic” widget so you won’t be missing anything at all. See the [Migration Guide](https://cabrerahector.com/wordpress/migrating-from-the-classic-popular-posts-widget/) for more details.

Bjorn from wplearninglab.com was kind enough to create a video explaining how to use the new block for all of you visual learners:

If you cannot (or do not want to) use WordPress blocks on your website then please replace your classic widget with the [[wpp] shortcode](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-%26-pages#the-wpp-shortcode).

## Blocks

This plugin provides 1 block.

* WordPress Popular Posts

## Installation

Please make sure your site meets the [minimum requirements](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts#requirements) before proceeding.

#### Automatic installation

1. Log in into your WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to Plugins > Add New.
3. In the “Search Plugins” field, type in **WordPress Popular Posts** and hit Enter.
4. Find the plugin in the search results list and click on the “Install Now” button.

#### Manual installation

1. Download the plugin and extract its contents.
2. Upload the `wordpress-popular-posts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the **WordPress Popular Posts** plugin through the “Plugins” menu in WordPress.

#### Done! What’s next?

1. Please see the Usage section below to learn how to add a popular post list to your site. Once you’re done, keep reading.
2. If you have a caching plugin installed on your site, flush its cache now so WPP can start tracking your site.
3. If you have a plugin that minifies JavaScript (JS) installed on your site please read this FAQ: [Is WordPress Popular Posts compatible with plugins that minify/bundle JavaScript code?](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#is-wordpress-popular-posts-compatible-with-plugins-that-minifybundle-javascript-code)
4. If you have a security / firewall plugin installed on your site, make sure you [allow WPP access to the REST API](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wpp-does-not-count-properly/#post-10411163) so it can start tracking your site.
5. Go to Appearance > Editor > Theme File Editor. Under “Theme Files”, click on “Theme Header” (`header.php`) and make sure that the `<?php wp_head(); ?>` tag is present (it should be somewhere before the closing `</head>` tag).
6. (Optional but highly recommended) Are you running a medium/high traffic site? If so, it might be a good idea to check [these suggestions](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/7.-Performance) to make sure your site’s performance stays up to par.

That’s it!

#### USAGE

WordPress Popular Posts can be used in three different ways:

1. If you’re using the [Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/) you can insert a WordPress Popular Posts block on your sidebar and even anywhere within your posts and pages.
2. As a template tag: you can place it anywhere on your theme with [`wpp_get_mostpopular()`](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags#wpp_get_mostpopular).
3. Via [shortcode](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-%26-pages), so you can embed it inside a post or a page.

Make sure to stop by the **[Wiki](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki)** as well, you’ll find even more info there!

That’s it! It stopped working. They themselves decided to abandon it for some reason. Now it doesn’t work on regular sites. Don’t even waste your time.===Всё! Перестал работать. Они сами зачем-то решили от него отказаться. Теперь на обычных сайтах не работает. Даже время не теряйте.

At first I though this was not that good but then with the widget settings amazing! But unfortunately the best bit of the plugin has been removed.
“This widget has been deprecated and will be removed in WordPress Popular Posts 7.0. Please use either the WordPress Popular Posts block or the wpp shortcode instead.” The short code doesn’t allow custom HTML and CSS like the widget, does it? Unless there is a way to add custom HTML to the shortcode I’m just keeping the old version for now. If I update this plugin I’ll lose the custom HTML that looks great and it was the reason I used this plugin. It’s disappointing the widget settings were just removed as it was nice having all the settings in one are. Now we just have to keep checking everything to add shortcode from your site which we shouldn’t have to do.Long ago to speed up the plugin on my site. I set the Ajaxify widget to Disabled and Data Caching to Never Cache. Then turned on the HTML option, hidden in the actual widget area so I could customize stuff. Hummingbird Optimizer was also turned off so I could see the updates properly.
