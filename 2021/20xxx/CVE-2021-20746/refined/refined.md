*   **Account Takeover:**  Malicious JavaScript could be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, perform actions on behalf of logged-in users, or deface the website.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: By compromising an administrator account, an attacker could gain full control over the website

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Shortcode:** The `[wpp]` shortcode was the primary attack vector.
*   **Malicious Input:** By crafting malicious input containing JavaScript code and using the shortcode, an attacker could inject their code into the website's database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needed to be logged into the WordPress website.
*   **Administrator or Author Privileges**: The attacker required at least Author privileges. Some reports also mention the need for administrator privileges to exploit this.  This suggests that the vulnerability may have existed in different forms accessible to users with different privileges.
