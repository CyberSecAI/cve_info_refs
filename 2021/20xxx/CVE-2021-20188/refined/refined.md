The provided content relates to CVE-2021-20188.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Podman versions prior to 1.7.0 not properly checking file permissions for non-root users within privileged containers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- File permissions for non-root users in privileged containers are ignored.
- Non-root users inside a privileged container can bypass discretionary access control, gaining access to files owned by other users, including the root user within the container.
- Privileged containers have many security features disabled, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A low-privileged user inside a privileged container can gain read/write access to any file within the container, including those owned by the root user.
- This allows for potential data confidentiality breaches, data integrity violations, and system availability issues within the containerized environment.
- It does not allow to directly escape the container.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker needs access to a privileged container as a low-privileged user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to a privileged container with a low-privileged user account.
- The attacker would need to compromise a service running inside the container.
