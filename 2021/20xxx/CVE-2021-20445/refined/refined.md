- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The autocomplete HTML attribute is not disabled for password fields in the Maximo Data Loader.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The lack of disabling the autocomplete attribute on password fields allows browsers to potentially save and autofill passwords, which can bypass the web application's intended authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass the authentication of the Maximo Data Loader.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web browser's autocomplete functionality interacting with the vulnerable password field in the Maximo Data Loader.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be in a position where they can interact with the login form of the affected Maximo Data Loader application, and the browser would need to have the ability to save/autocomplete passwords.
