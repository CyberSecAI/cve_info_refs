- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `mongodb-client-encryption` module version 1.2.0 does not properly validate the KMS server's certificate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper certificate validation in the client-side field level encryption (CSFLE) module.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful MITM attack could intercept traffic between the Node.js driver and the KMS service, rendering CSFLE ineffective and potentially exposing encrypted data.
- **Attack vectors:** A privileged network position, combined with an active MITM attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position.
    - The attacker needs to perform an active MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack.
    - The target application needs to be using the vulnerable version of the `mongodb-client-encryption` module.
    - The application must be using CSFLE (Client-Side Field Level Encryption).
    - The application must not be residing inside the AWS, GCP, or Azure network fabrics where compensating controls are in place.
