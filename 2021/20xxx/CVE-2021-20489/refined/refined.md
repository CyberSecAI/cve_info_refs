- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the IBM Sterling File Gateway user interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a CSRF vulnerability, which allows an attacker to induce a victim to perform actions they did not intend to.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially perform actions on the vulnerable application using the privileges of an authenticated user by tricking the user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user to submit a crafted request, exploiting the lack of proper CSRF protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and somehow induce a user authenticated to the target application into making that request. This usually involves tricking the user into visiting a crafted link or webpage while they are authenticated to the vulnerable application.
