- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from IBM Cloud Pak for Applications v4.3's failure to properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper privilege management, leading to an unintended sphere of control for an actor.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An actor could potentially gain more control than intended within the system due to the faulty privilege management.
- **Attack vectors:** The bulletin does not explicitly specify the attack vector but implies it involves exploiting the improper privilege assignment within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The bulletin doesn't specify required attacker capabilities or position but implies the attacker would need to be an "actor" within the system, whose privileges are not properly managed.
