Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

* ansible-test - Correctly detect running in a Docker container on Azure Pipelines.
* ansible-test - Prefer container IP at `.NetworkSettings.Networks.{NetworkName}.IPAddress` over `.NetworkSettings.IPAddress`.
* ansible-test - The `cs` and `openshift` test plugins now search for containers on the current network instead of assuming the `bridge` network.
* ansible-test - Using the `--remote` option on Azure Pipelines now works from a job running in a container.

For information about this policy, see the discussion at: <https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/ansible-meeting/2017-09-28/ansible_dev_meeting.2017-09-28-15.00.log.html> This fixes CVE-2020-1746

### [Security Fixes](#id117)

### [Minor Changes](#id133)

* Fixed typos in various modules regarding argument\_spec data types.
* dnf - Properly handle module AppStreams that don't define stream ([#63683](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/63683))

### [Bugfixes](#id134)

* **SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14904 - solaris\_zone module accepts zone name and performs actions related to that. However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions. A malicious user could provide a crafted zone name which allows executing commands into the server manipulating the module behaviour. Adding user input validation as per Solaris Zone documentation fixes this issue.
* ActionBase - Add new `cleanup` method that is explicitly run by the `TaskExecutor` to ensure that the shell plugins `tmpdir` is always removed. This change means that individual action plugins need not be responsible for removing the temporary directory, which ensures that we don't have code paths that accidentally leave behind the temporary directory.
* CVE-2019-14905 - nxos\_file\_copy module accepts remote\_file parameter which is used for destination name and performs actions related to that on the device using the value of remote\_file which is of string type However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions. A malicious code could crafts the filename parameter to take advantage by performing an OS command injection. This fix validates the option value if it is legitimate file path or not.
* Fix bandwidth calculation in nxos\_ospf\_vrf for Python 3 ([#66095](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/66095))
* Fix for network\_cli become method to be compatible with collections

* Fix issue where nxos\_l3\_interfaces was not rendering 'dhcp' in facts ([#66049](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/66049))
* Fix issue where nxos\_user unintentionally creates user with two different roles ([#65962](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/65962))
* Fix issue where purge breaks with empty aggregate ([#66004](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/66004)).

Ansible is a radically simple model-driven configuration management,
multi-node deployment, and remote task execution system. Ansible works

on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and
are transferred to managed machines automatically.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed
on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and
are transferred to managed machines automatically.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

- ansible-test - Always connect additional Docker containers to the network used by the current container (if any).
- ansible-test - Always map ``/var/run/docker.sock`` into test containers created by the ``--docker`` option if the docker host is not ``localhost``.
- ansible-test - Attempt to detect the Docker hostname instead of assuming ``localhost``.
- ansible-test - Correctly detect running in a Docker container on Azure Pipelines.
- ansible-test - Prefer container IP at ``.NetworkSettings.Networks.{NetworkName}.IPAddress`` over ``.NetworkSettings.IPAddress``.
- ansible-test - The ``cs`` and ``openshift`` test plugins now search for containers on the current network instead of assuming the ``bridge`` network.
- ansible-test - Using the ``--remote`` option on Azure Pipelines now works from a job running in a container.
- ansible-test - disable ansible-doc sanity test for vars plugins in collections, which are not supported by Ansible 2.9 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72336).
- async_wrapper - Fix race condition when ``~/.ansible_async`` folder tries to be created by multiple async tasks at the same time - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59306

- facts - fix distribution fact for SLES4SAP (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71559).
- kubectl - follow up fix in _build_exec_cmd API (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72171).

Bugfixes
--------

- Restore the ability for changed_when/failed_when to function with group_by.
- ansible-test - Always connect additional Docker containers to the network used by the current container (if any).

- ansible-test - Attempt to detect the Docker hostname instead of assuming ``localhost``.
- ansible-test - Correctly detect running in a Docker container on Azure Pipelines.
- ansible-test - Prefer container IP at ``.NetworkSettings.Networks.{NetworkName}.IPAddress`` over ``.NetworkSettings.IPAddress``.
- ansible-test - The ``cs`` and ``openshift`` test plugins now search for containers on the current network instead of assuming the ``bridge`` network.
- ansible-test - Using the ``--remote`` option on Azure Pipelines now works from a job running in a container.
- ansible-test - disable ansible-doc sanity test for vars plugins in collections, which are not supported by Ansible 2.9 ([ansible/ansible#72336](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/72336)).
- async_wrapper - Fix race condition when ``~/.ansible_async`` folder tries to be created by multiple async tasks at the same time - [ansible/ansible#59306](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59306)
- dnf - it is now possible to specify both ``security: true`` and ``bugfix: true`` to install updates of both types. Previously, only security would get installed if both were true. ([ansible/ansible#70854](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70854))
- facts - fix distribution fact for SLES4SAP ([ansible/ansible#71559](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71559)).

- powershell - remove getting the PowerShell version from the env var ``POWERSHELL_VERSION``. This feature never worked properly and can cause conflicts with other libraries that use this var
- user - AnsibleModule.run_command returns a tuple of return code, stdout and stderr. The module main function of the user module expects user.create_user to return a tuple of return code, stdout and stderr. Fix the locations where stdout and stderr got reversed.

- user - Local users with an expiry date cannot be created as the ``luseradd`` / ``lusermod`` commands do not support the ``-e`` option. Set the expiry time in this case via ``lchage`` after the user was created / modified. ([ansible/ansible#71942](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71942))

Debian Bug     : 1053693

Ansible a configuration management, deployment, and task execution system
was affected by multiple vulnerabilities.

CVE-2019-10206

    Fix a regression in test suite of CVE-2019-10206.

CVE-2021-3447

    A flaw was found in several
    ansible modules, where parameters containing credentials,
    such as secrets, were being logged in plain-text on
    managed nodes, as well as being made visible on the
    controller node when run in verbose mode. These parameters
    were not protected by the no_log feature. An attacker can
    take advantage of this information to steal those credentials,
    provided when they have access to the log files
    containing them. The highest threat from this vulnerability
    is to data confidentiality

CVE-2021-3583

    A flaw was found in Ansible, where
    a user's controller is vulnerable to template injection.
    This issue can occur through facts used in the template
    if the user is trying to put templates in multi-line YAML
    strings and the facts being handled do not routinely
    include special template characters. This flaw allows
    attackers to perform command injection, which discloses
    sensitive information. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.

CVE-2021-3620

    A flaw was found in Ansible Engine's
    ansible-connection module, where sensitive information
    such as the Ansible user credentials is disclosed by
    default in the traceback error message. The highest
    threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.

CVE-2021-20178

    A flaw was found in ansible module
    snmp_fact where credentials are disclosed in the console log by
    default and not protected by the security feature
    This flaw allows an attacker to steal privkey and authkey
    credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability
    is to confidentiality.

CVE-2021-20191

    A flaw was found in ansible. Credentials,
    such as secrets, are being disclosed in console log by default
    and not protected by no_log feature when using Cisco nxos moduel.
    An attacker can take advantage of this information to steal those
    credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to data confidentiality.

CVE-2022-3697

    A flaw was found in Ansible in the amazon.aws
    collection when using the tower_callback parameter from the
    amazon.aws.ec2_instance module. This flaw allows an attacker
    to take advantage of this issue as the module is handling the
    parameter insecurely, leading to the password leaking in the logs.

CVE-2023-5115

    An absolute path traversal attack existed
    in the Ansible automation platform. This flaw allows an
    attacker to craft a malicious Ansible role and make the
    victim execute the role. A symlink can be used to
    overwrite a file outside of the extraction path.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.7+dfsg-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1915808#c0)  Tapas Jena    2021-01-13 13:16:11 UTC  ``` The bitbucket_pipeline module leaks sensitive info such as secret values. This could lead in disclosing those credentials for every user which has access to the output of playbook execution.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1915808#c1)  Tapas Jena    2021-01-13 13:16:17 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Abhijeet Kasurde (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1915808#c5)  Tapas Jena    2021-01-18 14:35:51 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1917465](show_bug.cgi?id=1917465 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-20180 ansible: ansible module: bitbucket_pipeline_variable exposes secured values [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1917463](show_bug.cgi?id=1917463 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-20180 ansible: ansible module: bitbucket_pipeline_variable exposes secured values [fedora-all]")] Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1917464](show_bug.cgi?id=1917464 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2021-20180 ansible: ansible module: bitbucket_pipeline_variable exposes secured values [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1915808#c12)  RaTasha Tillery-Smith    2021-02-04 19:00:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  The version of Ansible provided in Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 does not contain the vulnerable bitbucket module and is not affected by this vulnerability. However, Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 no longer maintains its own version of Ansible. The prerequisite is to enable the Ansible repository in order to consume the latest version of Ansible, which includes bug and security fixes.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1915808#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-02-24 17:46:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 8   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2021:0663 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0663](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0663)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1915808#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-02-24 17:46:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.9 for RHEL 8   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.9 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2021:0664 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0664](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0664)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1915808#c16)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-02-24 19:02:30 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1928774#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-02-15 14:33:59 UTC  ``` In OpenLDAP through 2.4.57 and 2.5.x through 2.5.1alpha, an assertion failure in slapd can occur in the issuerAndThisUpdateCheck function via a crafted packet, resulting in a denial of service (daemon exit) via a short timestamp. This is related to schema_init.c and checkTime.  References:  <https://bugs.openldap.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9454> <https://git.openldap.org/openldap/openldap/-/commit/3539fc33212b528c56b716584f2c2994af7c30b0> <https://git.openldap.org/openldap/openldap/-/commit/9badb73425a67768c09bcaed1a9c26c684af6c30>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1928774#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-02-15 14:34:31 UTC  ``` Created openldap tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1928775](show_bug.cgi?id=1928775 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2021-27212 openldap: Assertion failure in slapd in the issuerAndThisUpdateCheck function [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1928774#c5)  Jan Pazdziora (Red Hat)    2023-07-25 15:09:06 UTC  ``` Hello,  while doing review of the Vulnerability Assessment report of RHEL 8.6 for the purpose of Common Criteria certification, we came across this [CVE-2021-27212](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-27212). The CVE page <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-27212> lists RHEL 8 as Not affected and RHEL 9 as Affected. It is not clear from that page why that should be the case.  Actually, in RHEL 9 [bug 1929142](show_bug.cgi?id=1929142) Simon says    The issue is in the openldap-servers package which is not present on RHEL 8 and newer.  So it seems like both RHEL 8 and 9 should be listed as Not affected, and the Statement should explain that openldap-servers (or slapd) is not shipped there, similar to <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2022-29155> or <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-25710>.  Is that a correct conclusion?  Thank you, Jan   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1928774#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-08-10 16:08:27 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-27212>   ``` |  |

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 34 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GNUToolchain](/wiki/Changes/GNUToolchain "Changes/GNUToolchain")
* [F34Boost175](/wiki/Changes/F34Boost175 "Changes/F34Boost175")
* [F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.16](/wiki/Changes/golang1.16 "Changes/golang1.16")
* [Remove\_make\_from\_BuildRoot](/wiki/Changes/Remove_make_from_BuildRoot "Changes/Remove make from BuildRoot")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, Januar 20th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

### Remove make from BuildRoot

*koji block-group-pkg f34-rebuild build make*

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f34
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f34. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f34 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f34
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-20 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.
