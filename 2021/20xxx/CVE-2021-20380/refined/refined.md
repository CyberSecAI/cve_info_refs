- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM QRadar Advisor with Watson App for IBM QRadar SIEM has a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthorized attacker could obtain sensitive information that could be used in further attacks against the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The advisory doesn't explicitly specify the attack vector. However, it can be inferred that the vulnerability is related to the QRadar Advisor application since the vulnerability exists in the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthorized attacker. The specific details on the required attacker capabilities are not available in the advisory, but the attacker must have a way to interact with the vulnerable application.
