- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Self Boot Engine (SBE) can be compromised from the service processor, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the Self Boot Engine (SBE) which is susceptible to unauthorized code injection. This bypasses the host firmware signature verification process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who gains root access to the service processor can compromise the integrity of the host firmware and bypass the firmware signature verification. This compromised state cannot be detected through TPM attestation.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to gain root access to the service processor to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have root access to the service processor.
