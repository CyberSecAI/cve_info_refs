Based on the provided content, this commit appears to address a vulnerability related to the configuration of the city database location in Live Helper Chat.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The application allowed users to specify the location of the city database file, which was used for geolocation purposes. The application was using user-supplied input for file path, and it was not sanitized.
- The vulnerability lies in the fact that the application was using a configurable path and validating the existence of a file based on user provided path instead of using a predefined path.
- This commit effectively disables the user-configurable option by hardcoding the path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal/Arbitrary File Access:** Allowing users to define the location of the city database file can be exploited to access files outside of the intended directory, potentially exposing sensitive information or leading to other attacks.
- **Insecure Default Value:** the application uses `var/external/geoip/GeoLite2-City.mmdb` as a default value, which might be accessible if not properly protected in the deployment environment

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server by providing a malicious path to the database location.
- An attacker might be able to cause application crash due to incorrect paths provided.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious user could access the administrative panel (or a vulnerable configuration page) and modify the "Location of city database" setting to point to a sensitive file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to have access to the administrative panel or a similar configuration interface where the city database location can be set.

**Changes introduced by the commit:**

- **`lhc_web/design/defaulttheme/tpl/lhchat/geoconfiguration.tpl.php`:**
    - In the form, the text input field for `CityGeoLocation` now has `readonly` attribute, preventing the user from changing the path.
- **`lhc_web/ezcomponents/Base/src/file.php`:**
    - Minor code change, might be related to fixing a bug.
- **`lhc_web/ezcomponents/ConsoleTools/src/input/option.php`:**
    - Minor code change, might be related to fixing a bug.
-   **`lhc_web/modules/lhchat/geoconfiguration.php`:**
    - The city database path is now hardcoded to `var/external/geoip/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`, effectively disabling user configuration.
    - The check for the existence of the file is still done, but now the path is fixed.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commit message "Disable to change city database location" clearly indicates the intention to remove the user-configurable database path.
- By making the field read-only and hardcoding the path, the vulnerability is mitigated.
- The commit also includes minor changes in other files, which may be related to the primary vulnerability fix.

The commit addresses a critical security vulnerability related to arbitrary file access through the misconfiguration of the city database path.
