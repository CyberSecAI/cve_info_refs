Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability addressed by commit `8836c4f` and pull request #87:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities were primarily due to the use of direct SQL queries, which were vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The application was using a custom `fetch`, `fetch_row`, `fetch_col` and `fetch_assoc` functions that were not sanitizing or using prepared statements when querying the database, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, the application used insecure MD5 hashing for passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **SQL Injection:** The application used direct SQL queries without proper sanitization or prepared statements, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to or modification of sensitive data.
2. **Insecure Password Hashing:** The application was using MD5 hashing for passwords, which is considered insecure and vulnerable to cracking.
3. **Use of insecure custom database functions:** Custom database functions such as `fetch`, `fetch_row`, `fetch_col`, and `fetch_assoc` bypassed standard secure database query practices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1. **Data Breach:** Successful SQL injection could lead to a complete data breach, exposing sensitive user information, assessment data, and other confidential details stored in the database.
2. **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify or delete existing data within the database.
3. **Account Takeover:** An attacker could potentially create new administrator accounts or modify existing user privileges, thereby taking control of the application.
4. **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** The vulnerabilities could result in both loss of data confidentiality and integrity, undermining the system's trustworthiness.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector was through input fields in the application that were used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization. Attackers could inject SQL code via these input fields. For example, the commit message `Fix form edit SQL injection attack` indicates user input fields used when editing a form were vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **Basic Web Interaction:** An attacker would need to be able to interact with the web application and identify vulnerable input fields.
2. **Knowledge of SQL:** A basic understanding of SQL syntax would be necessary to construct malicious SQL queries.
3. **No Privilege Required:** It appears these vulnerabilities could be exploited by any user that can interact with the vulnerable input fields.

**Mitigation:**

The commit `8836c4f` and the associated pull request #87 mitigate these issues by:

1.  **Transitioning to Doctrine DBAL:** The code was refactored to use Doctrine DBAL, which supports prepared statements and parameterized queries. This effectively eliminates the SQL injection vulnerabilities by ensuring that all SQL queries are properly parameterized and sanitized before execution.
2.  **Secure Password Hashing:** The password hashing mechanism was updated to use the native `password_hash()` function in PHP. This provides a more secure and robust method for hashing passwords.
3.  **Removal of Insecure Functions:** The custom `fetch`, `fetch_row`, `fetch_col` and `fetch_assoc` functions were removed from the code base.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message "Security Fix" and the pull request title "Security Fix" clearly indicate that the changes are for addressing security vulnerabilities.
*   The changelog entries specifically mention the fixes for SQL injection attacks and the change in password hashing, further emphasizing the security improvements.
*   The pull request included changes to numerous files across the application, indicating a systematic effort to address vulnerabilities.
*   The commits also include some code cleanup and refactoring, moving configuration to a `.env` file and removing LDAP functionality, in addition to the security fixes.
