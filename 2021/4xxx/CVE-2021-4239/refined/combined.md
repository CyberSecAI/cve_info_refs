# Vulnerability Report: GO-2022-0425

* CVE-2021-4239, GHSA-6cr6-fmvc-vw2p, and 1 more
* Affects:
  github.com/flynn/noise
* Published: Feb 15, 2022
* Modified: May 20, 2024

The Noise protocol implementation suffers from weakened cryptographic security after encrypting 2^64 messages, and a potential denial of service attack.
After 2^64 (~18.4 quintillion) messages are encrypted with the Encrypt function, the nonce counter will wrap around, causing multiple messages to be encrypted with the same key and nonce.
In a separate issue, the Decrypt function increments the nonce state even when it fails to decrypt a message. If an attacker can provide an invalid input to the Decrypt function, this will cause the nonce state to desynchronize between the peers, resulting in a failure to encrypt all subsequent messages.
