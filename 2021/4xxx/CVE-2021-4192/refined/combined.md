Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an enhanced
vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and use-after-free may lead to
a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2:8.1.0875-5+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

For the detailed security status of vim please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/vim>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an
enhanced vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and Null pointer
dereferences may lead to a denial of service (application crash) or other
unspecified impact.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2:8.0.0197-4+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

For the detailed security status of vim please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/vim>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
