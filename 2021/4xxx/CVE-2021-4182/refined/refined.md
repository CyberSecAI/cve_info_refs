Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4182:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content confirms that the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-4182 is indeed related to an infinite loop in the RFC 7468 file parser within Wireshark.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the RFC 7468 file parser, which can lead to an infinite loop during processing.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is the parser's inability to handle malformed or incomplete RFC 7468 files, causing it to enter an infinite loop and consume excessive CPU resources.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS) condition. By providing a specially crafted RFC 7468 file, an attacker can force Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially freezing the application and making it unresponsive.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves convincing a user to open a malicious packet trace file that triggers the infinite loop in the RFC 7468 parser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide or entice a victim into opening a malicious capture file.  No specific position or privileges are required as long as the user can open the file.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 3.6.0, and 3.4.0 to 3.4.10.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in versions 3.6.1 and 3.4.11.
*   The root cause is a flaw in the RFC 7468 file parser logic, allowing a specific kind of malformed file to make the parser loop infinitely.

**4. Additional Information from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Роман Донченко.
*   Fedora has issued updates for Fedora 34 and 35 to address this vulnerability in their Wireshark package.
*   Gentoo has issued GLSA 202210-04 to address this and other vulnerabilities, urging users to update.

In summary, CVE-2021-4182 describes an exploitable vulnerability in Wireshark's RFC 7468 file parser, allowing a crafted file to cause a denial-of-service condition by triggering an infinite loop and excessive CPU consumption.
