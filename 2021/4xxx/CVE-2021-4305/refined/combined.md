Avoid turning

```
/*********************.js$

```

into regex

```
new RegExp("^\/(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)(?:.*)\.js$")
```

which takes seconds to execute, while

```
new RegExp("^\/(?:.*)\.js$")
```

can achieve the same

Sorry, something went wrong.
