The provided content is related to CVE-2021-4139.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper output sanitization in the Pimcore classification store module. Specifically, the application was not escaping HTML characters when displaying data such as names and descriptions in grids and titles within the admin interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, as unsanitized data is rendered on the page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via the classification store, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the data within the Pimcore admin interface. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the admin interface
    - Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users
    - Information theft

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with sufficient permissions to create or modify classification store data (such as names, descriptions, titles, etc.) could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code.
- The injected code would then execute in the context of other users' browsers when they view the grid.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify data within the Pimcore classification store. This typically means having some level of administrative or editor access.
- No other special capabilities are needed, other than the access level to modify the classification store data.
