The provided content is related to a commit that addresses a potential vulnerability by escaping the query in the search window of the Pimcore admin UI.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The search query was not properly escaped, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input sanitization. The search query was being passed directly to the backend without escaping potentially harmful characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By injecting malicious code into the search query, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to use the search window within the Pimcore admin UI to input a crafted query containing malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the Pimcore admin UI with the ability to use the search window.
- They need to be aware of the vulnerability and the ability to craft an exploit.

**Technical Details:**
The commit modifies the javascript files responsible for handling search queries for assets, documents, and objects, specifically:
-   `bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/public/js/pimcore/element/selector/asset.js`
-   `bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/public/js/pimcore/element/selector/document.js`
-  `bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/public/js/pimcore/element/selector/object.js`

In each of the above files, the `search` function for assets and documents, and `applyExtraParamsToStore` function for objects, are modified to use `Ext.util.Format.htmlEncode()` to properly encode the `query` before passing it to the backend as an extra parameter. This encoding prevents the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

The commit replaces:
```javascript
proxy.setExtraParam("query", formValues.query);
```
with:
```javascript
let query = Ext.util.Format.htmlEncode(formValues.query);
proxy.setExtraParam("query", query);
```
and also updates the `updateTabTitle` function accordingly from:
```javascript
this.updateTabTitle(formValues.query);
```
to:
```javascript
this.updateTabTitle(query);
```
