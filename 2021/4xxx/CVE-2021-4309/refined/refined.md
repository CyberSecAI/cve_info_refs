The provided content is related to CVE-2021-4309.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` in multiple PHP files to generate the current script's filename for use in URLs or other contexts. This variable is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it can be manipulated by an attacker via URL manipulation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The code uses the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable which includes the filename from the URL. This value is used to generate links, which makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks. If an attacker crafts a URL with malicious JavaScript code, it would be included in the generated links.
- Improper Input Handling: The application does not sanitize or validate the input from the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`, making it possible to inject arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page by manipulating the URL, which can lead to various attacks, including:
  - Stealing user session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
  - Defacing the website by changing its content.
  - Redirecting users to phishing websites or other malicious sites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through URL manipulation. An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code into the URL, which will then be included when the code generates links within the application using `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the crafted URL to execute the injected JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to deliver this crafted URL to a victim, for example via email, social media or other means.
