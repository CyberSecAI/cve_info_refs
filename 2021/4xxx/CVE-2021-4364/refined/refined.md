Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `jobsearch_add_job_import_schedule_call` and `jobsearch_update_job_import_schedule_call` AJAX actions within the JobSearch WP Job Board plugin lack proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to execute these AJAX actions.
*  **Missing CSRF Protection:** The AJAX actions lack security nonces, making them vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*  **Authenticated Arbitrary WordPress Options Change:** The `jobsearch_job_integrations_settin_save` AJAX action allows any authenticated user to modify WordPress options by sending POST requests containing arbitrary key/value pairs which are then directly saved to the database without validation.
* **Unauthenticated Settings Change:** The `save_locsettings` function is accessible to any user, authenticated or not, allowing modification of plugin settings through a POST request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Schedule Modification:** Authenticated users, including those with low privileges like "subscriber," can add or modify scheduled job import calls.
*   **Website Takeover:** An authenticated user can modify any WordPress option, leading to potential website takeover by creating admin accounts or redirecting traffic.
*   **Plugin Settings Modification:** An unauthenticated user can modify the plugin settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **AJAX Action:** Attackers send AJAX requests to the vulnerable actions.
*   **POST request:** Attackers can send POST requests containing arbitrary data to modify plugin settings and wordpress options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** For the schedule modification vulnerability, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user (even with low-level privileges like "subscriber").
*   **Authenticated User:** For the arbitrary wordpress options change vulnerability, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
*   **Unauthenticated User:** For the plugin settings modification vulnerability, the attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes**
* The blog.nintechnet.com content provides more detail than the other sources, describing 3 distinct vulnerabilities.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.8.2 of the plugin.
