- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `product_id` POST parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges (Admin+) can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically via the `product_id` POST parameter in the `fetch_product_ajax.php` AJAX call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (Admin+) on the WordPress site.
