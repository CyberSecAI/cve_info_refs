  "CVE-2021-4327": {
    "description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in SerenityOS related to integer overflow when creating typed arrays from array buffers. This is not an official CVE description, as the CVE is a placeholder.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow during the calculation of the new byte length for a TypedArray when created from an ArrayBuffer. Specifically, `new_length * element_size` can overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected `new_byte_length`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow vulnerability when calculating the size of a typed array"
    ],
    "impact": "The integer overflow allows the creation of typed arrays with a smaller-than-expected `byteLength`, which can lead to out-of-bounds access. This allows arbitrary reads and writes in memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a specific typed array creation in javascript using a large size for the typed array with an ArrayBuffer."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code within the SerenityOS environment (e.g., through the browser).",
    "details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `initialize_typed_array_from_array_buffer` function within `Userland/Libraries/LibJS/Runtime/TypedArray.cpp`. The multiplication of `new_length * element_size` can overflow, resulting in a small `new_byte_length`. This then leads to out-of-bounds access when using the TypedArray, allowing the attacker to read and write to arbitrary memory locations. This exploit uses a combination of a Javascript bug with a kernel bug to gain full system control."
