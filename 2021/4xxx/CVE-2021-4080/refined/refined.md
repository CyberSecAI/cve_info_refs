Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit `cdc913d`:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation on file uploads. Specifically, the application did not sufficiently restrict the types of files that could be uploaded, allowing for the potential upload of malicious PHP files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted file upload:** The application allowed the upload of files without adequate checks on their content and type. This was present in multiple areas including expense receipts, company logos and admin avatars.
- **Inadequate MIME type validation:** The initial file upload checks relied on MIME type validation, which can be easily bypassed by manipulating the file headers.
- **Missing content-based checks:** There were no checks to verify that uploaded files actually contained the type of content specified by their extension.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Data theft and manipulation:**  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to steal sensitive data, modify application data, or deface the website.
- **Denial of Service:** Uploaded files may be used to cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File upload functionality:** The attacker would use the file upload forms to upload malicious files disguised as legitimate file types. This vulnerability existed in the handling of:
    - Expense receipts.
    - Company logos.
    - Admin avatars.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user to access the upload features of the application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints:** The attacker would need to be aware of the file upload functionality and the absence of adequate validation.

**Additional Information:**
- The commit `cdc913d` addresses the vulnerability by:
  - Introducing new request classes `AvatarRequest.php` and `CompanyLogoRequest.php` which use a custom rule `Base64Mime.php` for handling base64 encoded images.
  - Updating `ExpenseRequest.php` to restrict the types of allowed attachments.
  - Updating `ExpensesController.php`,  `UploadReceiptController.php` and `CompanyController.php` to use the new request classes.
- The custom `Base64Mime.php` rule is introduced to check the content of base64 encoded data, verifying the content type based on its magic bytes, thus preventing attackers from using incorrect extensions or fake mime types.
- The commit includes changes to multiple files to enforce proper file upload validation across the application.
- The referenced pull request `#681` is titled "Unrestricted php file upload fix", confirming the nature of the vulnerability.
