{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "JSS did not properly free up all the memory resulting from a TLS connection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could force the invocation of Linux's Out-Of-Memory process, causing a denial of service by saturating the server's RAM. Over time, the wasted memory builds up.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and does not need any specific privileges or user interaction. A network connection is required to exploit the vulnerability.",
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is present in the JSS (Java Security Services) library. The vulnerability can be triggered by repeated TLS connections. The vulnerability has been fixed in jss versions 5.1.0 and 4.9.3. This vulnerability was rated as a medium severity issue by Ubuntu and Red Hat and high severity by CVSS with a score of 7.5."
