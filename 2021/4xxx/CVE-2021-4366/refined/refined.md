Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2021-4366:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the lack of proper authorization checks within the `pwaforwp_update_features_options` function of the PWA for WP & AMP WordPress plugin. This function is responsible for updating the plugin's settings, but it does not verify if the user performing the action has the necessary privileges. Instead, it relies solely on a nonce for CSRF protection, which is accessible to any logged-in user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a capability check before executing the `pwaforwp_update_features_options` function. This allows any authenticated user, regardless of their role or permissions, to potentially alter the plugin settings.
2.  **Reliance on Nonce:** The plugin incorrectly relies on a CSRF nonce for authorization purposes. The nonce is generated and made available to all logged-in users, defeating the purpose of access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Settings Modification:** An attacker can modify various settings of the PWA for WP & AMP plugin. The specific impact of these modifications would depend on the nature of the settings and their effect on the WordPress site.
*   **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability is linked to a separate arbitrary file upload vulnerability that uses the same nonce, which can lead to RCE. An authenticated user could upload a malicious zip file containing PHP scripts, and have these scripts extracted and accessible on the server, leading to RCE.
*   **Compromised PWA Functionality:**  By modifying the settings, an attacker could potentially disable or otherwise interfere with the Progressive Web App functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site, even with minimal privileges (e.g., a subscriber role).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the affected WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to send the malicious request to the vulnerable server.
*   **Understanding of Plugin Mechanics:**  A basic understanding of how WordPress plugins work and how to interact with AJAX endpoints is needed to exploit this.

**Additional Details:**
* The `pwaforwp_splashscreen_uploader` function also lacks a capability check and relies on the same `pwaforwp_security_nonce` nonce, leading to Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability.
* The issue was reported on June 22, 2021, and fixed on June 24, 2021 with the release of version 1.7.33
* The nonce is exposed to all logged-in users via the `pwaforwp_enqueue_style_js` function.
