The PWA for WP & AMP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the  pwaforwp_update_features_options function in versions up to, and including, 1.7.32. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to change the otherwise restricted settings within the plugin.
