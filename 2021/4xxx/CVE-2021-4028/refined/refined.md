**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   Use-after-free in the `RDMA listen()` function within the Linux kernel, specifically when a `rdma_id_private` is destroyed without calling `cma_cancel_listens()`.
    * A race condition related to address binding in `rdma_bind_addr()` which could corrupt `src_addr`.
    *  The issue stems from incorrect handling of the `src_addr` memory and improper state transitions when the RDMA listener state is not `RDMA_CM_IDLE` before calling `rdma_bind_addr()`.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect memory management of RDMA id structures.
    *   Race condition leading to potential memory corruption and use-after-free scenarios.
     *  Improper state transition management within the RDMA communication manager.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   System crash (denial of service) due to use-after-free.
    *   Potential for local privilege escalation by leveraging the use-after-free to execute arbitrary code.
    *   Possible disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Local attack vector as the vulnerability requires the ability to setup a socket to listen on a high port.
        *   Specifically, a local user can trigger this vulnerability by calling `listen()`.
        *    The vulnerability is triggered when `rdma_bind_addr()` is called with a non-idle state and attempts to use potentially freed `src_addr` memory.
    *   The bug can be triggered by multiple concurrent calls to `lvchange` using the same block device, causing the device to be suspended.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Local user access on the system.
    * Ability to execute code
    * Must be able to setup a socket and call `listen()` on it.

*   **Additional Details (from patch description):**
    *   The vulnerability occurs when the `src_addr` memory is reused indirectly to create an any address, rather than explicitly creating a new one on the stack, which is the normal procedure.
    *   The incorrect usage of the `cma_src_addr` with a potentially mangled address family causes issues during cancellation operations.

**3. Additional Notes**

*   The provided patch fixes this vulnerability by allocating a `sockaddr_in` struct on the stack to store the any address instead of re-using the existing `src_addr` memory, thus avoiding the use-after-free.
* Red Hat assigned an "Important" severity to this vulnerability.
* NetApp rated the vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.8 (HIGH)
* Multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) address this CVE.
* The issue was reported by syzbot.
* The vulnerability was discovered in Linux kernel versions prior to 5.1.15.
