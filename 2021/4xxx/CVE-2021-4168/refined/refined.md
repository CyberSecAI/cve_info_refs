Based on the provided commit, the changes appear to be related to a security update in the ShowDoc project. The core issue revolves around the use of `I()` function to retrieve parameters, which is vulnerable to parameter pollution/injection. This commit addresses this by switching from `I("parameter")` to `I("post.parameter")` for POST requests in several controller files.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The original code uses `I("parameter")` to retrieve request parameters. This function appears to be vulnerable to parameter injection or pollution as it doesn't explicitly specify the request method (GET or POST) it is retrieving the parameters from.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Parameter Pollution/Injection:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the request by sending parameters in both the URL (GET) and the body (POST) with the same name, potentially overriding the intended values. For example, a user could send a GET request with `item_id=1` and a POST request with `item_id=2`. If the code uses `I("item_id")`, it is not guaranteed which one is actually used leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify data or bypass authorization checks by exploiting parameter pollution. For example, an attacker might be able to change an item's ID or user's ID to that of another to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Access control bypass:** The parameter injection in the `TeamController::attorn` method could allow an attacker to transfer ownership of a team to another user.
*   **Unauthorized actions:** Similarly, parameter injection in `AdminUserController::deleteUser` method could be exploited by an attacker to delete a different user than intended.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Maliciously crafted HTTP requests, sending parameters with the same name via different request methods (both GET and POST).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints of the ShowDoc application. They don't need to be authenticated in some cases, but for others need to have a user account with authorization to the application, depending on the specific function.
*   The attacker needs to be aware of the request parameters used by the ShowDoc application and know the relevant API endpoint to target.

**Specific code changes:**

The commit modifies several controller files in the `server/Application/Api/Controller` directory. Here are a few examples:

*   `AdminItemController.class.php`: Changes `I("item_id/d")` to `I("post.item_id/d")` in `deleteItem` and `attorn` functions, ensuring that parameters are retrieved from the POST data.
*   `AdminUserController.class.php`: Similarly, updates `I("uid/d")`, `I("username")`, and `I("password")` to `I("post.uid/d")`, `I("post.username")`, and `I("post.password")` respectively.
*   `CatalogController.class.php`: Updates `I("cat_id/d")`, `I("cats")` and `I("item_id/d")` to `I("post.cat_id/d")`, `I("post.cats")` and `I("post.item_id/d")` respectively.
*   `ItemController.class.php`: Updates `I("item_id/d")`, `I("username")`, `I("password")`, `I("item_name")`, `I("item_domain")` to use the "post" source
*   Other controller files have similar changes, consistently using `I("post.parameter")` for POST request parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message "Security update / 安全更新" indicates that these changes are specifically addressing a security vulnerability.
*   The changes are focused on controller files, which handle incoming requests and data processing.
*   The diffs show a clear pattern of changing parameter retrieval from `I("param")` to `I("post.param")`, indicating a systematic fix for the vulnerability across multiple endpoints.

In summary, this commit addresses a parameter pollution vulnerability by explicitly retrieving POST parameters using `I("post.parameter")` instead of the generic `I("parameter")`. This change enhances the application's security by preventing attackers from manipulating request parameters and potentially performing unauthorized actions.
