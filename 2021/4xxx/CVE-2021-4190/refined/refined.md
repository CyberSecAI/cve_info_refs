  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-4190",
      "details": "The Kafka protocol dissector could go into an infinite loop due to a crafted packet with manipulated varint values. Specifically, the dissector would read a count of tagged items, then loop that many times to read tagged fields. A malformed packet can cause the dissector to repeatedly read from the same offset due to a failure to advance the pointer, resulting in an infinite loop.",
      "affected_versions": "Wireshark versions 3.6.0, 3.4.0 to 3.4.11",
      "fixed_versions": "Wireshark versions 3.6.1, 3.4.12",
      "root_cause": "The Kafka dissector did not handle malformed varint encoded fields, specifically in the tagged items array, leading to an infinite loop due to a failure to advance the reading pointer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of malformed varint data",
        "Lack of bounds checking or loop termination condition in dissector"
      ],
      "impact": "Wireshark can crash due to an infinite loop, resulting in denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Injecting a malformed Kafka packet onto the network",
        "Convincing a user to read a malformed packet trace file"
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft and inject malformed Kafka packets or to distribute a malformed packet capture file."
