The WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Setting Changs in versions up to, and including, 5.5. This is due to lacking both a security nonce and a capabilities check. This makes it possible for low-authenticated attackers to change plugin settings even when they do not have the capabilities to do so.
