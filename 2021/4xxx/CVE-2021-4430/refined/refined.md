The provided content is related to CVE-2021-4430.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from a mistaken attempt to simplify the definition of environment variables. The build process was incorrectly using Webpack's `DefinePlugin` to expose all server-side environment variables to the client-side JavaScript bundle. This caused the entire server's environment to be serialized into an object and included within the JavaScript bundle.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Exposure of sensitive server-side environment variables via the client-side JavaScript bundle. This included configuration data, API keys, or other secrets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information about the server environment which could lead to further attacks or data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could extract the sensitive environment variables by simply inspecting the JavaScript bundle.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to access the client-side JavaScript bundle, which is generally accessible to anyone who can access the web application.
