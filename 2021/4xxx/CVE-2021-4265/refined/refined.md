Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to potential XSS vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The application was using `html_safe` on address fields, which allowed users to inject HTML tags, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability. Specifically, the `invoicing_address` and `shipping_address` fields were vulnerable in both the `Common` and `Customer` models.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the potential for XSS attacks due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied address fields. By injecting malicious HTML into the address fields, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts to perform actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the application
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**

- **Address fields:**  The attack vector is primarily through the `invoicing_address` and `shipping_address` fields in the `Common` and `Customer` models. An attacker would need to inject malicious HTML into these fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to modify address fields:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify either the `invoicing_address` or `shipping_address` fields in the application. This may require user-level access depending on the application.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is mitigated by adding validations to the address fields, ensuring that they do not contain HTML tags by using a regular expression to disallow the use of angle brackets.
- Additionally, the application now enforces SSL by default unless the `NO_FORCE_SSL` environment variable is set.

**Additional notes:**

- The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description, showing the specific code changes made to address the vulnerabilities.
- The commit message "Fix possible XSS issues" clearly indicates the nature of the security concern.
- The pull request discussion also highlights that the address fields were the only fields that were using `html_safe`.
- The commit includes changes to enforce SSL by default. This also contributes to improving the security posture of the application.
