Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `global-data` role in the `cattle-global-data` namespace grants write access to Catalogs.
-  Each user with any level of catalog access was inadvertently bound to the `global-data` role.
- This grants write access to `CatalogTemplates` and `CatalogTemplateVersions` for all users with any level of catalog access, even if they are not supposed to have it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Any user with any catalog access (including the default `user` role) was granted unintended write access to catalog templates and template versions.
- **Incorrect RBAC:** The `global-data` role was overly permissive, granting write access to resources that should have been restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A malicious user with any level of catalog access could:

1.  **Modify application visibility:** Make applications or individual versions visible or hidden in the UI by modifying the `version` and `rancherMaxVersion` fields.
2.  **Spoof application icons:** Change the logo (`icon` field) of an application or template to an arbitrary image.
3.  **Misrepresent chart trust:**  Make less trusted charts appear more legitimate by adding the label `io.rancher.certified: partner`.
4.  **Swap template versions:** Swap files between different charts or versions within the same catalog by changing the `versionDir` field. This can lead to users deploying modified versions of charts when they expect the original ones.
   - Note: Arbitrary code injection via the base64 encoded `files` field is not possible.
- The vulnerability allows the injection of existing apps from registered catalog if the attacker lacks catalog access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Network-based attacks are possible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Low privileges are required. Any user with any catalog access can exploit this vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required for the attack.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Rancher instance through the network.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to Rancher when the `restricted-admin` role is enabled (either via environment variable `CATTLE_RESTRICTED_DEFAULT_ADMIN=true` or the configuration flag `restrictedAdmin=true`).
- Patched versions: 2.5.13, 2.6.4 and later releases
- Workaround: Limit access in Rancher to trusted users.
