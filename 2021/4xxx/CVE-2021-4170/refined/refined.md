The provided content relates to a commit in the `calibre-web` repository on GitHub. The commit message indicates "Fix upload of cover and book formats containing html characters". The code diff shows changes in `cps/static/js/edit_books.js` related to handling filenames when uploading book formats and cover images. It appears that the javascript code was modified to correctly display the filename after a file is selected for upload, addressing issues with "fakepath" prefixes that some browsers add to filenames.

Based on the provided information, it seems the vulnerability addressed by this commit was a client side issue with how filenames were being displayed in the UI when uploading files. It did not involve server-side code, or expose any sensitive information. This vulnerability would not qualify for a CVE.

Based on this analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect handling of file paths in JavaScript when displaying filenames after uploading.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The javascript code was not correctly parsing the filename, particularly when a fakepath prefix was introduced by the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:** This is not a typical vulnerability, but it might have caused user confusion. The incorrect display of filenames might have made it harder for the user to confirm the correct file was being uploaded

**Attack vectors:** None

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** None

**Conclusion:**
The provided content is related to a bug fix related to filename handling in the UI. It does not qualify as a security vulnerability and does not relate to CVE-2021-4170.
