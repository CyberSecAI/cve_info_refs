  "cve": "CVE-2021-4181",
  "description": "The Sysdig Event dissector could crash due to malformed packets with a number of params greater than expected.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Wireshark versions 3.6.0, 3.4.0 to 3.4.10"
  ],
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Sysdig event dissector in Wireshark is vulnerable to a crash due to an insufficient check on the number of parameters in a sysdig event",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted packet with a number of parameters greater than expected by the dissector can cause Wireshark to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [

    "required_capabilities": "An attacker can send the malformed packet over the network, or convince a user to open a crafted packet capture file",
