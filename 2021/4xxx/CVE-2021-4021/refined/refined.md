Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4021:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Radare2 handles ELF64 binaries for the MIPS architecture when a large section filled with zeros is present. Mapping this huge section, interpreted as NOPs (no operation instructions), leads to excessive resource consumption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Uncontrolled resource consumption: Radare2 attempts to analyze a large region of memory filled with NOPs without proper limits.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The extensive analysis of the large NOP section results in a hang or very long processing times, effectively causing a DoS.
- Vulnerability exists in Radare2 versions prior to 5.6.2, 5.6.0, 5.5.4, and 5.5.2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition. Radare2 becomes unresponsive or takes an impractically long time to complete analysis.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malicious ELF64 binary: An attacker provides a specially crafted ELF64 binary for MIPS architecture that includes a very large section of zeros.
- Network: The CVSS score specifies a network attack vector, suggesting the file can be delivered remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to provide a specially crafted ELF64 binary to the vulnerable version of radare2.
- No specific user interaction or privileges required.

**Additional Details**
- The issue is related to how the tool interprets and maps large sections of memory with no operations (NOPs), leading to extensive and unproductive analysis.
- A fix involves limiting the analysis of NOP sequences or by imposing a limit on basic block sizes during analysis.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity with a CVSS base score of 7.5.
- The issue is also tracked as GitHub Security Advisory `GHSA-4g55-4fxv-2g82`
- The issue is associated with CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion) and CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration)
