Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4349

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing or improper nonce validation in the Process Steps Template Designer plugin. Specifically, the plugin's code checks for the existence of a nonce value before verifying it. If the nonce is not present in the request, the verification is skipped, making the plugin susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The core issue is the lack of proper CSRF protection. The plugin relies on the presence of a nonce to validate requests, but fails to enforce that check if the nonce is absent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unspecified Attacks:** The Wordfence description states that an unauthenticated attacker could conduct unspecified actions on the site by using a crafted request.
- **Arbitrary actions:** As the attacker can cause a logged-in admin to perform actions without their consent by using crafted requests, they could potentially be able to perform any action that the user is allowed to do (such as deleting posts, changing user information, etc).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link/Form:** An attacker would need to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or submitting a forged form that makes a request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- **Unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform the CSRF attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Position:** The attacker can be external to the application.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to socially engineer a site administrator into interacting with a malicious link or form.
- **No authentication needed:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of the "Process Steps Template Designer" plugin up to and including 1.2.1.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3 and later.
- **Specific File:** The vulnerable code is located in `/icons-selector/font-awesome-field.php` at line 215, where the nonce check is implemented but can be bypassed if `$_POST['fa_field_icon_nonce']` isn't set.
- **Nonce Bypass:** The code snippet shows that the nonce check is skipped if the `$_POST['fa_field_icon_nonce']` is not set.
```
if ( isset( $_POST['fa_field_icon_nonce'] ) && ! wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['fa_field_icon_nonce'], 'fa_field_icon' ) ) {
   return;
}
```
- **Further explanation:** The blog.nintechnet.com content explains that the root cause of the vulnerability is the conditional check. Because the check is based on `isset`, the verification of the nonce is not executed if the value is not set.
- **Multiple vulnerabilities:** The blog.nintechnet.com content also shows that this is just one of the plugins that had similar CSRF vulnerabilities due to the same missing check.
