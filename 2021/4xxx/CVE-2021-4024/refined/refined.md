{
  "CVE-2021-4024": {
    "description": "The `podman machine` function spawns a `gvproxy` process on the host system. The `gvproxy` API is accessible on port 7777 on all IP addresses on the host. If that port is open on the host's firewall, an attacker can potentially use the `gvproxy` API to forward ports on the host to ports in the VM, making private services on the VM accessible to the network. This issue could be also used to interrupt the host's services by forwarding all ports to the VM.",
    "root_cause": "The `podman machine` command, when creating and managing Podman virtual machines, spawns a `gvproxy` process that binds to all IP addresses on the host.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
      "Origin Validation Error"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially use the `gvproxy` API to forward ports on the host to ports in the VM, making private services on the VM accessible to the network. The attacker could also interrupt the host's services by forwarding all ports to the VM.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network access to port 7777 on the host where `podman machine` is running.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs network access to the host's port 7777 and the ability to send requests to the `gvproxy` API."
