Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an open redirect vulnerability in the `oils-js` framework. The framework's redirect functionality was not properly validating the destination URL, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary, malicious site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation for redirect URLs.  The original `redirect` function within the Express framework was directly used, which doesn't inherently prevent open redirects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to redirect users to a malicious website. This could be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through manipulating the `url` parameter that is passed to the `redirect` function. If an attacker can control or influence this parameter, they can redirect the user to a location of their choosing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to influence the redirect URL that is passed to the `redirect` function. This could be achieved by manipulating query parameters or other user-controlled inputs that the application uses for redirects.

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix introduces a `fixOpenRedirect` function that wraps the original `redirect` function.
*   This new function checks if the URL starts with `://`.
*   If it does, it compares the URL to a list of allowed redirect hosts stored in `web.conf.allowedRedirectHosts`.
*   The host of the current request is automatically added to `allowedRedirectHosts` on the first redirect that contains `://`.
*   If the URL does not start with an allowed host, an error is thrown preventing the redirect.
*   The `conf-default.js` file now includes the `allowedRedirectHosts` configuration option, initialized as an empty array.
*   A log message is added to indicate when the host has been added. A warning is logged along with user information if the URL is not found within the allowed list of hosts.

**Summary of Changes:**
*   **core/Web.js:** Implements the `fixOpenRedirect` function that overwrites the express `redirect` with a safe version.
*   **core/conf/conf-default.js:**  Adds the `allowedRedirectHosts` configuration option to restrict allowed redirect URLs.
*   **package-lock.json:**  Updated dependencies.
*   **package.json:**  Updated version and dependencies.

This commit introduces a fix for an open redirect vulnerability by validating redirect URLs against a list of allowed hosts, preventing users from being redirected to arbitrary external sites.
