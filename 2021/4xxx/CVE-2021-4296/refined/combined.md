Fix XSS risk

[@jean-gui](https://github.com/jean-gui) I haven't tested it and am light years away of being in a position to test it, so your help in verifying this fix the bug and in deploying it if it does would be greatly appreciated

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@dontcallmedom](https://github.com/dontcallmedom) [@jean-gui](https://github.com/jean-gui) I was the one who reported the vulnerability. I'm sorry if my words are inappropriate. But I was unable to deploy the unicorn and check the suggested edits. Everything worked perfectly, XSS on my Payloads are no longer observed. HTML is escaped. You can check it here: <http://80.211.182.47:8081/unicorn/> |
