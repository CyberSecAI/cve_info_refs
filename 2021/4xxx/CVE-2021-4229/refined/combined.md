## Embedded malware in ua-parser-js

High severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-pjwm-rvh2-c87w)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-pjwm-rvh2-c87w/dependabot)

## Package

npm

ua-parser-js
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

= 0.7.29
= 0.8.0
= 1.0.0

## Patched versions

0.7.30
0.8.1
1.0.1

## Description

The npm package `ua-parser-js` had three versions published with malicious code. Users of affected versions (0.7.29, 0.8.0, 1.0.0) should upgrade as soon as possible and check their systems for suspicious activity. See [this issue](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js/issues/536) for details as they unfold.

Any computer that has this package installed or running should be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer. The package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Hi!  See a warning at npm - <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js> - `This package has been hijacked. Please revert to 0.7.28`  First question - Can we use range `^0.7.28`, or it is not safe?  Second question - Will you create a new package, or try to remove hijacked versions and continue update this package? |

| Hi all, very sorry about this.  I noticed something unusual when my email was suddenly flooded by spams from hundreds of websites (maybe so I don't realize something was up, luckily the effect is quite the contrary).  I believe someone was hijacking my npm account and published some compromised packages (`0.7.29`, `0.8.0`, `1.0.0`) which will probably install malware as can be seen from the diff here: <https://app.renovatebot.com/package-diff?name=ua-parser-js&from=0.7.28&to=1.0.0>  I have sent a message to NPM support since I can't seem to unpublish the compromised versions (maybe due to npm policy <https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish>) so I can only deprecate them with a warning message. |

| Extra carefulness required because it seems to be affecting linux machines as well, make sure the miner doesn't get installed in your servers & ci stuff  For now it seems to only hang in installing because the url containing the infection doesn't seem to be working, but it may not last  Linux users can use this command to see if the miner is running or not and stop it : `ps -aux | grep jsextension` |

So, ua-parser-js will need up version to 2.0.0, when want to push real updates  That's right but it's a safest method I think. You can continue with version 2.0.0 and users don't specify a specific version will not be affected. |

| a solution that we're using to address this vulnerability is to set the resolutions in pacakge.json to use the last good version:  `...},"resolutions": { "ua-parser-js": "0.7.28" },...`  That resolution will come in handy when using a library that depends on the latest of `ua-parser-js`  as opposed to using `ua-parser-js` directly in your package.json dependencies. |
