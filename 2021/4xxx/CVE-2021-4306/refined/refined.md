The provided content relates to CVE-2021-4306.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the `misc.markupWidth` function. The original regular expression `/\^\[[^\]]\*]|\^(.)/g` used to remove markup from a string was vulnerable to ReDoS with a crafted string like `'^['.repeat(bigNumber)`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inefficient regular expression that could lead to excessive backtracking when processing certain inputs, causing a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user could provide a specially crafted input string that would cause the application to hang or become unresponsive. This can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could send a crafted string with a large number of `^[` sequences to the vulnerable `misc.markupWidth` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to provide input that will be processed by the vulnerable code. This could be through user-controlled input fields or other means of data entry into the application.

**Additional Details:**
The vulnerability was fixed by changing the regex to `/\^\[[^^[\]]\*]|\^(.)/g`.
The commit message explicitly states "Fix a possible ReDoS, the regex: /\^\[[^\]]\*]|\^(.)/g was replaced by: /\^\[[^^[\]]\*]|\^(.)/g".
The commit also adds a SECURITY.md file, emphasizing responsible disclosure for security vulnerabilities, and noting the preference for maintainers fixing the issue.
