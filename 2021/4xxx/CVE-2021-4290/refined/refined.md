Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of string concatenation to build SQL queries, specifically within the `passport.js` file. This practice makes the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The code directly embeds user-provided data (like email and id) into the SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized data access: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to read, modify, or delete data from the database beyond what they are normally authorized to access.
- Authentication bypass: In the context of the login, an attacker could potentially bypass authentication by injecting SQL code that manipulates login verification.
- Database compromise: Severe exploitation can lead to complete database takeover, allowing an attacker to control the entire database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through user-controlled input fields, such as those used for login or registration. An attacker can input crafted strings that modify the intended SQL queries.
   - The email field is mentioned as a vulnerable point in 2 locations.
   - The id field is mentioned as a vulnerable point in 1 location.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to input data into the vulnerable fields, which are typically present in user interfaces like login or registration forms.
- Basic knowledge of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques is necessary to craft malicious input.

**Changes made to fix the vulnerability:**
The commit demonstrates how to fix the vulnerability by switching from string concatenation to prepared statements (parameterized queries), replacing:

```javascript
connection.query("select * from users where id = " + id, function (err, rows) { ... });
```
with
```javascript
connection.query("select * from users where id = ?", [id], function (err, rows) { ... });
```
and similarly for the other SQL queries.
This ensures that user-supplied data is treated as literal values, preventing SQL injection attacks.
