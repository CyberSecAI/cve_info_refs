The uListing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass via wp_route due to missing capability checks, and a missing security nonce, in the StmListingSingleLayout::import_new_layout method in versions up to, and including, 1.6.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change any WordPress option in the database.
