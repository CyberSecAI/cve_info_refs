Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-4357, and other critical vulnerabilities found in the uListing plugin:

**1. Root Cause:**
   - **Missing Authorization Checks:** The plugin lacked proper capability checks and security nonces on several functions, allowing unauthenticated access to sensitive functionalities.
    - **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Several endpoints were vulnerable to SQL injection and arbitrary option changes because of a lack of user input validation and sanitization.
   
**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Account Creation:**  An attacker can create an administrator account by submitting a role during the registration process, as the plugin doesn't validate the user role.
   - **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Account Change:** An unauthenticated user can edit any user account by exploiting the profile edit feature, including the admin account.  This includes changing email addresses and profile pictures.
   - **Unauthenticated WordPress Options Change (via AJAX and WP_Route):** An unauthenticated attacker can modify any WordPress option in the database. This could be used to enable registration, change user roles, or redirect website traffic.
   - **Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:**  An unauthenticated user can retrieve a list of all users and their email addresses via an insecure search function.
   - **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Roles and Capabilities Creation/Deletion:**  An attacker can add or delete roles, and add capabilities without authentication.
   - **Unauthenticated SQL Injection (Multiple Instances):** Both user-supplied data, such as listing IDs and IP addresses are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.
   - **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post/Page Deletion:** An unauthenticated attacker can delete any post or page on the website.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Complete Website Takeover:** Attackers could gain full control of the WordPress site through arbitrary admin account creation and modification.
   - **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized users can access sensitive user information such as email addresses.
    - **Website Defacement/Redirection:** Attackers could redirect website traffic to malicious sites and deface the website using the ability to change site options.
   - **Data Loss:** Ability to arbitrarily delete posts and pages.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Unauthenticated users can create or add capabilities, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions on the site.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
    - **Direct HTTP Requests:** The plugin exposes API endpoints via AJAX and WP_Route, making them accessible directly through HTTP requests.
    - **Forged Requests:** The lack of proper authorization and security nonces means that attackers can construct malicious requests without needing prior authentication or specific user permissions.
    - **Unsanitized Input:**  Attackers can use specially crafted SQL queries and/or malicious data within HTTP requests.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **No authentication required:**  The vulnerabilities can be exploited by anyone with network access to the WordPress site, and no prior authentication is required.
   - **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints:** Attackers would need to know the exposed API endpoints of the plugin to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerabilities were reported to the WordPress Plugin Team after failed attempts to contact the plugin authors.
-  A new version of the plugin, 1.7, was released to address the flaws.
-  The plugin also had issues with bypassing security plugins due to character encoding in WP_Route API, but this could be mitigated using a robust firewall such as NinjaFirewall.
