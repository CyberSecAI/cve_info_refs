Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress lacks proper capability checks in several functions. Specifically, the `download_orderdetail_list()`, `change_orderlist()`, and `download_member_list()` functions are vulnerable. These functions are hooked to the `admin_init` action, which can be triggered without authentication, and they do not verify if the user is an administrator.
*   Additionally, the `usces_download_system_information` AJAX action lacks a capability check, allowing logged-in users to access sensitive system information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization/Capability Checks:** The core issue is the failure to implement authorization checks before executing sensitive functions. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger actions intended for administrators and logged-in users to access system information without the necessary permissions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to lists of members, products, and orders, as well as sensitive system information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can download CSV files containing customer data (members, orders) and product information.
*   **System Information Disclosure:** Logged-in users can download a JSON-encoded file that includes system information such as WordPress settings, theme and plugin details, Welcart settings, payment method configurations, server settings and PHP settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:** The vulnerable functions are triggered by specific requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` or `wp-admin/admin-post.php` scripts, which can be accessed by unauthenticated users.
*   **Authenticated System Information Disclosure:** The vulnerable AJAX action can be triggered by any logged-in user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:** An attacker needs no prior authentication to the WordPress site to exploit the missing authorization checks.
*   **Authenticated System Information Disclosure:** An attacker must be logged into the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Welcart e-Commerce versions up to and including 2.2.7.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.8.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the developers on July 29, 2021 and the fix was released on July 31, 2021.
*   The Wordfence article lists the CVE ID, CVSS score, and researcher, as well as remediation steps.
*   The NinTechNet blog provides additional detail, including code snippets and examples of the exported data. It mentions that the `admin_init` hook doesn't guarantee user authentication, which contributes to the vulnerability.
