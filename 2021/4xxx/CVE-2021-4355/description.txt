The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on the download_orderdetail_list(), change_orderlist(), and download_member_list() functions called via admin_init hooks in versions up to, and including, 2.2.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download lists of members, products and orders.
