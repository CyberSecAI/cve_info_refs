The provided content describes a vulnerability in the NodeGoat application, specifically related to the research page. This vulnerability is a combination of an intentional SSRF and an unintentional denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **SSRF:** The research page allows users to specify a URL and query parameters via the `url` and `symbol` query parameters. This allows an attacker to make the server connect to arbitrary URLs.
*   **DoS:** The `needle` library callback in `app/routes/research.js` does not properly handle errors when making the request to the target URL. If the request fails (e.g., the target server is unavailable), `newResponse` will be undefined, and accessing `newResponse.body` leads to a `TypeError` which crashes the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application allows users to control the URL the server requests, leading to SSRF.
*   **Uncaught Exception (DoS):** Failure to handle errors when making external requests leads to an uncaught exception which crashes the server when the request fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **SSRF:** An attacker can use the SSRF vulnerability to make the server connect to internal services or other external resources. This could potentially expose sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the server.
*   **DoS:** The DoS vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the server by sending a request to the research page with a URL that will cause the server request to fail. This could lead to service downtime.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker sends a GET request to `/research` with the `url` and `symbol` query parameters.
*   For SSRF, the attacker specifies a URL that points to an internal or external resource that they wish to interact with.
*   For DoS, the attacker specifies a URL that causes a request failure (e.g., `http://localhost:4001/` if the server is running on `localhost:4000` and no service is on port 4001).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable NodeGoat server.
*   The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the SSRF and DoS vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided content includes a link to the commit that addresses this vulnerability, and shows the code changes made to fix the DoS by adding a check for the existence of the `body` property of the response before attempting to use it.
