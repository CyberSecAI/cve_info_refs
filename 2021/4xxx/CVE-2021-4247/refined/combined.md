### **[rcowsill](/rcowsill)** commented [Jan 24, 2021](#issue-792841085)

| The research page intentionally exposes a SSRF vulnerability which allows an attacker to submit unexpected `url` and `query` params. The tutorial demonstrates how this can be used to make the server connect to an attacker-controlled site.  As well as this expected vulnerability there's a bug in [app/routes/research.js](https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat/blob/f2514a5f71c69d5639d56e88980b86d31a20b436/app/routes/research.js) which crashes the server if the request to that target URL fails.  This happens when visiting (eg) `http://localhost:4000/research?url=localhost%3A4001%2F&symbol=login` while the server is running locally on port 4000:  ``` [...]\app\routes\research.js:23                 res.write(newResponse.body);                                       ^  TypeError: Cannot read property 'body' of undefined     at [...]\app\routes\research.js:23:39     at done ([...]\node_modules\needle\lib\needle.js:442:14)     at ClientRequest.had_error ([...]\node_modules\needle\lib\needle.js:452:5)     at ClientRequest.emit (events.js:310:20)     at Socket.socketErrorListener (_http_client.js:426:9)     at Socket.emit (events.js:310:20)     at emitErrorNT (internal/streams/destroy.js:92:8)     at emitErrorAndCloseNT (internal/streams/destroy.js:60:3)     at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:84:21)  ```  What's happening is that the needle callback skips setting the content-type when there's an error, but still tries to append `newResponse.body` to `res`. If there's an error, `newResponse` is undefined and the server crashes. |

| [@rcowsill](https://github.com/rcowsill) Thanks for reporting this issue and identifying the root cause. Yes, there should be a check for undefined value of `newResponse`. I'd be happy to merge a PR in case you have bandwidth to fix it. |
