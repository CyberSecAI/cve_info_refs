Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-4359:

**Root Cause:**
The primary root cause is a lack of proper authorization checks and security nonces in the "Frontend File Manager" WordPress plugin. This allows unauthenticated users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to, as well as bypass security checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The plugin allows modification of the user ID via the `$_GET['file_owner']` parameter, leading to unauthorized access to other users' files.
*   **Unauthenticated Content Injection/Stored XSS:** The `wpfm_edit_file_title_desc` AJAX action allows unauthenticated users to modify post titles and content, leading to content injection and Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the lack of sanitization on post titles in the backend allows for execution of injected JavaScript when an admin visits the plugin settings.
*   **Authenticated Settings Change:** The `wpfm_save_settings` AJAX action allows any authenticated user to modify plugin settings without capability checks or security nonces, including allowed file types, which could be leveraged by an attacker for further attacks.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload (chained):** By changing settings to allow PHP files to be uploaded, an attacker can use the `wpfm_upload_file` AJAX action to upload a malicious PHP script to the server, leading to remote code execution.
*  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion:** The `wpfm_delete_file` AJAX action lacks authentication and security nonce, allowing unauthenticated users to delete arbitrary posts and pages on the site.
*   **Unauthenticated Post Meta Change:** The `wpfm_file_meta_update` AJAX action allows unauthenticated users to modify post meta data without validation/sanitization, enabling arbitrary file downloads by changing the path.
*   **Unauthenticated HTML Injection:** The `wpfm_send_file_in_email` AJAX action allows unauthenticated users to send emails with custom HTML in the message body, which could lead to spam and phishing attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to files by impersonating other users.
*   **Content Defacement/Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the title and content of posts and pages.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading malicious PHP scripts, attackers can gain full control of the server.
*   **Data Loss:** Attackers can delete arbitrary posts and pages.
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** Attackers can download sensitive files by manipulating post meta data.
*   **Spam/Phishing:** Attackers can use the site as a spam relay by sending emails with malicious content.
*   **Account compromise** by injecting JavaScript code, an attacker can create a malicious administrator account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST requests:** Exploiting the `$_GET['file_owner']` parameter for privilege escalation and direct AJAX requests to vulnerable endpoints.
*  **Direct access to AJAX endpoints:** All vulnerabilities exploited by sending crafted AJAX requests to plugin's handlers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication required** for most of the vulnerabilities
*   For remote code execution, the attacker needs to authenticate to change settings, but unauthenticated users can still upload files.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerabilities are present in versions of the plugin up to and including 18.2. Version 18.3 fixes the identified issues.
* The `wpfm_get_current_user` function is insecure as it allows overriding the current user's ID via the `file_owner` parameter in the request.
* The plugin lacks proper security measures such as nonce verification and capability checks.
*   Multiple vulnerabilities are chained together to achieve remote code execution.
