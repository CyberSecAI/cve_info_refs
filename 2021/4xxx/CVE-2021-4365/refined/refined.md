Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-4365:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the lack of proper authentication and sanitization of user inputs within the "Frontend File Manager" WordPress plugin. Specifically, multiple AJAX actions lacked nonce verification, capability checks, and proper sanitization functions, allowing for unauthorized access and manipulation of data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `wpfm_edit_file_title_desc` AJAX action did not properly sanitize the file title, allowing unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This code would then execute when an admin user views the plugin's settings pages or the post itself.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The plugin used the `$_GET['file_owner']` parameter to retrieve the user ID, which could be manipulated to impersonate another user.
*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion:** The `wpfm_delete_file` AJAX action did not verify the user's authorization to delete a post, allowing unauthenticated users to delete any post.
*  **Unauthenticated Post Meta Change and Arbitrary File Download:** The `wpfm_file_meta_update` AJAX action allowed unauthenticated users to modify post meta data without proper validation or sanitization, potentially leading to arbitrary file download by changing the file path.
*   **Authenticated Settings Change and Arbitrary File Upload:** The `wpfm_save_settings` AJAX action lacked capability checks and security nonces, allowing authenticated users to modify the pluginâ€™s settings, for example, allowing upload of PHP files and then uploading malicious scripts.
*   **Unauthenticated HTML Injection:** The `wpfm_send_file_in_email` AJAX action allowed unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary HTML code into emails, allowing for spam and phishing attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Attackers could upload and execute malicious PHP files, leading to complete control of the server.
*   **Account compromise:** Attackers could create new admin accounts using the stored XSS vulnerability, gaining full control over the website.
*   **Data manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete any post or page, as well as modify post meta, leading to data loss and manipulation of the website content.
*   **Spam and Phishing:** Attackers could use the website as a spam relay, sending unsolicited emails to potential victims.
*   **File download:** Attackers could force the server to download arbitrary files from the server by manipulating post meta data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerabilities were exploited through direct HTTP requests to the plugin's AJAX endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** Most of the vulnerabilities could be exploited by unauthenticated users.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers only needed network access to the vulnerable WordPress website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were present in versions up to and including 18.2 of the plugin.
*   Version 18.3 of the plugin addresses these security flaws.
*   The plugin's reliance on the `wpfm_get_current_user` function and lack of proper sanitization and authorization checks was a key factor in the vulnerabilities.
