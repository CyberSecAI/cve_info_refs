### CVE-2021-4002

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) flush in the hugetlbfs (huge pages filesystem) when unmapping a page of Page Middle Directories (PMDs) by clearing a Page Upper Directory (PUD). The code incorrectly assumed a TLB flush was not necessary under these circumstances, leading to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing TLB Flush:** The core issue is the absence of a TLB flush operation after unmapping PMDs, specifically when a PUD is cleared, leading to the potential reuse of unshared pages. This is a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability.
*   **Incorrect Assumption:** The kernel code comment inaccurately states that the TLB flush is not necessary in this specific scenario, resulting in the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Leak:** A local attacker could potentially read data from a freed and reallocated huge page before a proper TLB flush occurs.
*   **Data Corruption:** A local attacker could write to a freed and reallocated huge page, potentially corrupting data intended for a different process.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If executable code is mapped onto hugetlbfs, this vulnerability allows modification of the executable code.
* **Denial of Service:** System hangs were observed in some instances due to corrupted timer queues.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User:**  The attacker must be a local user on the system, potentially without special privileges, but can also be a user with certain privileges, like having access to an overlayfs mount or CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities.
* **Ability to use hugetlbfs:** Specifically, the attacker needs to be able to use the hugetlbfs, for example via `mmap` or `shmget` with `SHM_HUGETLB`.
*   **Timing:** The attacker must be able to trigger the unmapping and reallocation sequence in a specific window to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel 3.6 with commit `24669e58477e`.
*   The fix involves adding a call to `tlb_flush_pmd_range()` in `__unmap_hugepage_range()` when `huge_pmd_unshare()` succeeds, and forcing a flush before returning from `__unmap_hugepage_range()`.
*   The issue affects systems using hugetlbfs, which is a virtual filesystem that provides a way for applications to allocate huge pages in RAM. This is often done using `mmap(MAP_HUGETLB)` or `shmget(SHM_HUGETLB)`.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available that uses shared memory and a child process to demonstrate the information leak by leaking data from the child back to the parent. The PoC uses shared PUDs to create the memory leak, which can then be read in a second process after the first frees it.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is resolved by backporting and applying commit `a4a118f2eead` to the affected kernel versions.

The provided Red Hat content confirms that the fix is included in the following advisories:

These advisories and bug reports provide more details and context, and confirm that the issue is a legitimate security vulnerability that needs to be addressed.

The redhat bugzilla entry notes,
> A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.
