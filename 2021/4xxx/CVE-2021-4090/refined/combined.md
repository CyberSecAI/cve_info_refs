Subject: [[PATCH v1] NFSD: Fix exposure in nfsd4_decode_bitmap()](#r)
Date: Sun, 14 Nov 2021 15:16:04 -0500	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <163692036074.16710.5678362976688977923.stgit@klimt.1015granger.net> (<raw>)

rtm@csail.mit.edu reports:
> nfsd4_decode_bitmap4() will write beyond bmval[bmlen-1] if the RPC
> directs it to do so. This can cause nfsd4_decode_state_protect4_a()
> to write client-supplied data beyond the end of
> nfsd4_exchange_id.spo_must_allow[] when called by
> nfsd4_decode_exchange_id().

Rewrite the loops so nfsd4_decode_bitmap() cannot iterate beyond
@bmlen.

Reported by: rtm@csail.mit.edu
Fixes: d1c263a031e8 ("NFSD: Replace READ* macros in nfsd4_decode_fattr()")

Hi Bruce-

This version is cleaned up slightly and has been tested as follows:

- I am not able to crash a patched server using rtm's nfsd_1
- No new FAILUREs with NFSv4.1 pynfs tests
- No new failures with xfstests on NFSv4.1 or NFSv4.2
- No new failures with the git regression suite on NFSv4.1 or NFSv4.2
- No reports of NFS4ERR_BADXDR or GARBAGE_ARGS during xfs or git regr

Hopefully that exercises enough uses of nfsd4_decode_bitmap() to be
confident that it is working properly.

I tested this on top of my XDR tracepoint series, so the line numbers
might be a little off from your current tree. However, it should
otherwise apply cleanly.
