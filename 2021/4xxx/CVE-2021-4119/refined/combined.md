```
Altered access & usage of the /search/users/select endpoint with the
following changes:
- Removed searching of email address to prevent email detail discovery
  via hunting via search queries.
- Required the user to be logged in and have permission to manage users
  or manage permissions on items in some way.
- Removed the user migration option on user delete unless they have
  permission to manage users.
