Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit `e765e618547c92f4e0b46caca6fb91f0174efd99` in the BookStack repository:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `/search/users/select` endpoint was previously allowing unauthenticated users to search for user details, including email addresses, by making arbitrary search queries. This allowed for the harvesting of user information without proper authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The main weakness was the exposure of user email addresses via a publicly accessible search endpoint.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The endpoint did not enforce proper authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated users to access user data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Detail Harvesting:** Attackers could enumerate and collect email addresses of users registered on the BookStack instance. This information could be used in further attacks such as phishing campaigns or password spraying.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request to the `/search/users/select` endpoint:** The vulnerability could be exploited by sending GET requests with search queries to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only required network access to the BookStack instance. They didn't need any specific user credentials to exploit the issue.

**Mitigation in the Commit:**

The commit addresses the vulnerability by making the following changes:
*   **Email Search Removal**: The search functionality was altered to no longer search based on email address.
*   **Authentication and Authorization**: The `/search/users/select` endpoint now requires the user to be logged in and have one of the following permissions:
    *   `users-manage`
    *   `restrictions-manage-own`
    *   `restrictions-manage-all`
*   **User Migration Restriction**: The user migration option on user deletion is now also restricted to users with the `users-manage` permission.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message mentions "Addressed user detail harvesting issue".
*   The commit includes changes to `UserSearchController.php`, `UserRepo.php`, `delete.blade.php`, and associated test files.
*   The commit references the huntr.dev bounty report: `<https://huntr.dev/bounties/135f2d7d-ab0b-4351-99b9-889efac46fca/>`, this confirms this commit is related to the vulnerability.
