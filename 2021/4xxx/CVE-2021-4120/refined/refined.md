Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-4120:

**Root Cause:**

- Insufficient validation of input strings used in snap content interface and layout paths within `snapd`. Specifically, the `read` attribute of content slots and the paths in layouts were not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** `snapd` failed to properly sanitize or validate the strings provided for content interface `read` settings and layout paths. It treated them as filepaths, without proper quoting or filtering.
- **AppArmor Injection:**  Due to the lack of validation, it was possible to inject arbitrary AppArmor policy rules by embedding them within these paths.
- **Profile Loading Behavior:** `snapd` loaded AppArmor profiles without handling compilation failures. If the profile for the snap-update-ns failed to compile (due to invalid rules), the profile for the snap application could still be loaded, allowing the injected rules to be active if the mount namespace already existed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **AppArmor Sandbox Escape:** By injecting arbitrary AppArmor rules, attackers could escape the strict confinement imposed on snaps, gaining unauthorized access to the system resources.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By escaping the sandbox and gaining access to system resources, the attacker could escalate privileges and perform actions outside the intended scope of the snap.
- **Arbitrary Rule Injection:** Attackers could use this to grant any AppArmor rule to the plug side of a content interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Snap:** An attacker could create a malicious snap package with a specially crafted content slot or layout definition.
- **Snap Store Publication:** The malicious snap could be published to the snap store.
- **Auto-connection:**  For snaps from the same publisher, content interfaces can be auto-connected. This makes it easier for an attacker to have their malicious snap's plug connect to their malicious snap's slot.
- **Local Snap:** The exploit could also be achieved using local snaps, which do not need to be published to the store

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create and publish snaps or install a local snap:**  The attacker needs to be able to create and install snap packages, and optionally publish them on the snap store.
- **Local Access (Implicit):** The vulnerability requires the installation of a malicious snap, which would typically imply a local attack vector.
- **User interaction:** The user must install and run the malicious snap.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability existed in how `snapd` processes the `read` attribute in content slots and path definitions in layouts.
- The `read` attribute is supposed to define file paths that the plug side of the content interface can access from the slot. The attacker crafts a string for this attribute that includes apparmor rules and abuses the comma (`,`) character to make it appear like a file path to snapd. 
- The injected AppArmor rules are placed in the snap's AppArmor profile, which grants the plugging app specific permissions. 
- The vulnerability also exists in the layout attribute, where attacker can inject a similar AppArmor profile using a similar method.
- The exploit works because snapd doesn't validate the crafted string before pasting it into the apparmor profile, and does not quote it to treat it as a single filepath.
- The exploit leverages the fact that even if the `snap-update-ns` profile fails to compile, the snap application profile can still load, as long as the mount namespace already exists.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in `snapd` version 2.54.3, and by updates in Ubuntu.
-  The `system-files` and `personal-files` interfaces are also potentially vulnerable, but are closely monitored.
- The `netlink-driver` interface had a similar injection possibility, but this could not be used for sandbox escape.
- The fix for this vulnerability involved stricter pattern enforcement for filepaths, and excluding paths with commas or braces for example.

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the necessary remediation steps.
