      "content": "The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-4044, specifically concerning its impact on NetApp products.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause lies in the mishandling of negative return values from the `X509_verify_cert()` function within the OpenSSL library. This is further exacerbated by a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that causes `X509_verify_cert()` to return an internal error when processing a certificate chain without Subject Alternative Name extension under certain conditions.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: The primary vulnerability is the mishandling of internal errors within the OpenSSL library when verifying X.509 certificates. Specifically, negative return values, intended to indicate internal errors, are incorrectly interpreted, leading to the unexpected return value `SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY`. This unexpected return, combined with a related bug, can induce application-dependent errors.\n\n**Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to Denial of Service (DoS). Other potential impacts depend on the specific application, but may include crashes, infinite loops or other incorrect responses.\n\n**Attack vectors**: An attacker can induce the vulnerable code path by providing a crafted certificate to an OpenSSL 3.0.0 client. This crafted certificate chain would not have the Subject Alternative Name extension but has the name constraints enforced by the Certificate Authority.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to send a crafted certificate chain to a vulnerable NetApp product's OpenSSL client. No special privileges are mentioned to be required.",
