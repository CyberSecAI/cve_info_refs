Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-4363:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary root cause is the lack of proper access control checks and sanitization within the WordPress WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin. Specifically:
    *   The `save_content_front` function does not verify if the user has the necessary privileges to edit or create posts/pages.
    *   The `save_admin_options` function doesn't validate user capabilities before updating plugin settings.
    *   Input sanitization is missing which leads to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Broken Access Control (Authenticated Content Injection):**
    *   The `save_content_front` function allows any authenticated user to modify or create posts and pages, regardless of their intended role or capabilities.
2.  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The `save_content_front` function utilizes `print_r($_REQUEST)`, which outputs unsanitized user input, making it susceptible to reflected XSS. This is exploitable through a CSRF attack.
3.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) & Authenticated Settings Change:**
    *   The `save_admin_options` function allows any authenticated user to modify plugin settings without proper checks.
    *   The plugin settings are saved without sanitization, allowing the injection of JavaScript code into the "btnText" and "disBtntext" variables, resulting in Stored XSS that executes when logged-in users visit the admin dashboard.
4.  **Lack of Security Nonces:** Both the `save_content_front` and `save_admin_options` actions lack security nonces, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Content Injection:** An attacker can modify or create arbitrary posts and pages on the WordPress site, potentially defacing the site or injecting malicious content.
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser by tricking them into clicking a malicious link. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.
*  **Stored XSS:** Attacker can inject malicious JavaScript in the plugin settings, which will be executed in the browser of any logged-in user.
*   **Settings Manipulation:** An attacker can alter plugin settings, potentially disrupting functionality or further compromising the site through malicious settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attackers exploit vulnerable plugin endpoints via HTTP requests.
*   **User Interaction:** The reflected XSS vulnerability requires tricking a user into clicking on a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** For content injection, settings manipulation and Stored XSS, the attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site (with any role).
*   **Social Engineering:** For reflected XSS, the attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin is no longer maintained and has been removed from the WordPress plugin repository due to these vulnerabilities.
*   The Wordfence analysis provides a CVSS score of 6.1 (Medium) for the reflected XSS vulnerability.
