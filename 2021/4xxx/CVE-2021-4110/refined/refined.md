Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-4110:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content is a commit log for `mruby` which discusses changes to `mrb_proc_copy()`. This is likely relevant to CVE-2021-4110, as the changes involve adding `mrb_state` as an argument, which, according to the commit message, is required for garbage collection that may be invoked.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability, which the commit aims to fix, arises from the `mrb_proc_copy()` function potentially invoking garbage collection without having access to `mrb_state`. This implies that prior to the fix, `mrb_proc_copy` could have been called in a context where the garbage collector would either not function correctly, leading to crashes or other undefined behaviors.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness was a missing `mrb_state` argument in `mrb_proc_copy()`. The old implementation was not aware of the `mrb_state`, which is vital for the proper execution of the garbage collection and memory management inside `mruby`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Without the fix, `mrb_proc_copy()` could potentially lead to:
    - Crashes: due to the garbage collector not functioning properly without the required state.
    - Memory Corruption: Due to incorrect memory management.
    - Undefined Behavior: Due to the potential for the garbage collector and other memory management functions not behaving as expected.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by:
    - Crafting malicious code that calls `mrb_proc_copy()` without the necessary `mrb_state`, causing the garbage collector and memory manager to malfunction, potentially leading to a crash or other exploitable conditions.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker would need to be able to:
    -  Execute mruby code.
    -  Craft specific scenarios where `mrb_proc_copy()` is called, and where the absence of `mrb_state` could trigger the garbage collection or memory management errors.

**7. Technical Details:**

* **Code Changes:** The commit introduces changes in the following files:
    * `include/mruby/proc.h`: The function signature of `mrb_proc_copy` is updated to `void mrb_proc_copy(mrb_state *mrb, struct RProc *a, struct RProc *b);`, adding the `mrb_state` parameter.
    * `src/class.c`: Calls to `mrb_proc_copy` are updated to include the `mrb` parameter.
    * `src/proc.c`: The implementation of `mrb_proc_copy` is updated to accept and use the `mrb_state`, as well as updating all the calls of this function in the file.

* **Commit Message:** The commit message states "The function may invoke the garbage collection and it requires `mrb_state` to run." This highlights the root cause and the reason for adding the argument.

In summary, the provided content outlines a vulnerability related to missing the `mrb_state` argument in the `mrb_proc_copy()` function within the `mruby` project that could lead to crashes and other undefined behavior due to improper garbage collection.
