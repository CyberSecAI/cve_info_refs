# Vulnerability Report: GO-2021-0061

* CVE-2021-4235, GHSA-r88r-gmrh-7j83
* Affects:
  gopkg.in/yaml.v2, github.com/go-yaml/yaml
* Published: Apr 14, 2021
* Modified: May 20, 2024

Due to unbounded alias chasing, a maliciously crafted YAML file can cause the system to consume significant system resources. If parsing user input, this may be used as a denial of service vector.

### @simonferquel **[simonferquel](/simonferquel)** commented [Jun 14, 2018](#issue-332347436)

This PR gives user code the opportunity to limit the number of values unmarshalled while decoding a yaml payload.

This is very usefull to protect programs from malicious external yaml documents such as these:

```
version: "3"
services: &services ["lol","lol","lol","lol","lol","lol","lol","lol","lol"]
b: &b [*services,*services,*services,*services,*services,*services,*services,*services,*services]
c: &c [*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b,*b]
d: &d [*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c,*c]
e: &e [*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d,*d]
f: &f [*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e,*e]
g: &g [*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f,*f]
h: &h [*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g,*g]
i: &i [*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h,*h]

```

This is a valid document, but parsing this will crash the program with an out of memory panic at some point.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@omeid](https://github.com/omeid) the implementation that was merged is different; this PR suggested a configurable limit, whereas the code merged has a hard coded limit.  The test case looks similar, because both are based on the same YAML exploit (the example can be found on WikiPedia: <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack>)  That said, it would've been nice if this PR had gotten attention earlier. |

| [@thaJeztah](https://github.com/thaJeztah) Yeah, it's internally handled, but it's not quite hardcoded. We consider the percentage of aliases in the overall document. And we also look at the depth since that's where the issue happens. You are also right that this should have been looked into before. |

Package        : golang-yaml.v2
Version        : 2.2.2-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-4235 CVE-2022-3064

Two denial of service vulnerabilities have been discovered in
golang-yaml.v2, a library which provides YAML support for the Go
language.

CVE-2021-4235

    Due to unbounded alias chasing, a maliciously crafted YAML file can
    cause the system to consume significant system resources. If parsing
    user input, this may be used as a denial of service vector.

CVE-2022-3064

    Parsing malicious or large YAML documents can consume excessive
    amounts of CPU or memory.

Thanks to Scarlett Moore for working on preparing this update.
