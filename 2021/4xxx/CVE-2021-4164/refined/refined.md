Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the changes made in commit `785726deee13b4d56f6c3503dd57c1e3eb7d6f30` which is related to CVE-2021-4164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit migrates several routes from GET to POST requests. These routes involve actions like:
- Shutting down the server.
- Performing a full sync with Kobo.
- Resetting a user's password.
- Importing LDAP users.
- Deleting a book.
- Deleting a Kobo authentication token.
- Adding/removing books to/from shelves.
- Deleting a shelf.
- Sending a book to a Kindle device.

The vulnerability likely stems from the fact that these actions were previously accessible via GET requests. GET requests are often cached by browsers and intermediary proxies, making them vulnerable to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks. An attacker could trick a user into clicking a link or loading an image that performs these sensitive actions on the user's behalf without their knowledge or consent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CSRF vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive actions via GET requests, which are susceptible to CSRF attacks.
- **Lack of proper request method enforcement:** The application was not enforcing the correct request methods for these actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:

-   **Shut down the server:**  Potentially causing denial of service.
-   **Perform a full sync with Kobo:**  Leading to data manipulation or unexpected behavior.
-   **Reset a user's password:**  Gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
-   **Import LDAP users:** Creating unauthorized user accounts.
-   **Delete books:** Resulting in data loss for users.
-   **Delete Kobo authentication tokens:** Forcing users to re-authenticate or disrupting their Kobo integration.
-   **Manipulate shelves:**  Adding/removing books from shelves without the user's consent.
-  **Delete shelves:** Causing data loss.
-  **Send books to a Kindle device:** Potentially sending unauthorized books to the user's kindle.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **CSRF Attack:**  An attacker could embed a malicious link or script on a website, an email, or a chat message.  If a user is logged into Calibre-Web, their browser might unknowingly send a GET request to perform the actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user into clicking a crafted link or loading malicious content that sends the GET request.
-   The attacker does not necessarily require direct access to the Calibre-Web server itself.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commit migrates the routes from GET to POST. POST requests are not cached by default and are not as vulnerable to CSRF, although they still require CSRF protection via a token.
- The commit also includes changes to the JavaScript code (`main.js`) to reflect the change in request methods from `GET` to `POST` for these actions. Also include adding `contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8"` and `dataType: "json"`, to provide correct data handling.
- Several places where the previous ajax calls were implemented were changed from `method: "get",` to `method: "post",`
- The commit also includes CSRF tokens in the shelf.html template for delete actions, which is not strictly related to the GET to POST change but does provide additional protection.

The identified changes in this commit address the vulnerability by switching from GET to POST and provide an additional layer of security by implementing CSRF protection to prevent malicious use of these requests.
