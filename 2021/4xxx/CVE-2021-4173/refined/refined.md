  "CVE-2021-4173": {
    "Description": "Vim is vulnerable to Use After Free with nested :def function.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from improper handling of memory when defining nested functions within Vim9 scripts. Specifically, a 'line_to_free' variable is not correctly managed during the compilation of nested :def functions, which may lead to a double free condition.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability, double-free.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could cause a denial-of-service, possibly leading to application termination or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious Vim script that defines nested functions within the vim9 script.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the ability to execute a crafted Vim script."
