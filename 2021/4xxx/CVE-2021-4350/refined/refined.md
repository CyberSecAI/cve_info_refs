Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4350

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication and sanitization in the `wpfm_send_file_in_email` AJAX action within the Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authentication:** The `wpfm_send_file_in_email` AJAX action does not require authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger the email sending functionality.
*   **HTML Injection:** The email body is constructed by directly incorporating user-provided content without sanitization. This enables injection of arbitrary HTML into the email body.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Spam Relay:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to send arbitrary emails using the WordPress site's email functionality, effectively using the site as a spam relay. This can lead to the site's IP address being blacklisted, disrupting legitimate email communications.
*  **Custom Email Content:** The attacker can control the email's subject, recipient, and body, including formatting, images, and other HTML elements.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **AJAX Request:** The attacker sends a crafted AJAX request to the `wpfm_send_file_in_email` action, including the malicious HTML content in the email body parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior user account or authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable site.

**Additional Details:**
*   The plugin's code fails to check the validity of the file ID, allowing emails to be sent even when no valid file is associated.
*   The vulnerability exists in Frontend File Manager plugin versions up to and including 18.2.
*   The issue was fixed in version 18.3
