The provided content relates to a fix for a SQL injection vulnerability, as indicated by the commit message "preventing sql injection" and the pull request title.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `orderByRaw` parameter was being processed in the `EloquentRepositoryAbstract.php` file. The code was directly using the provided `orderByRaw` string in a database query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `sord` parameter (sort order).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the susceptibility to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of input sanitization of the `orderByRaw` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL execution: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or even denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET parameters: Specifically the `sord` parameter, which contributes to the construction of the `orderByRaw` clause.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with control over the `sord` parameter in the query string.
- No special privileges are required

**Changes introduced to fix the vulnerability**
The code was changed to parse the raw order by string and then call the eloquent query builder with column name and order direction.

```php
foreach(explode(",", $orderByRaw) as $subOrderByRaw) {
    $params = preg_split("/\ /i", trim($subOrderByRaw));
    if (count($params) == 2) {
        $rows = $rows->orderBy($params[0], $params[1]);
    } elseif (count($params) == 1) {
        $rows = $rows->orderBy($params[0]);
    }
}
```
