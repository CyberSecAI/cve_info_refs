- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability was introduced in Insight Agent v3.0.1 where certain DLLs were loaded and executed with `SYSTEM` permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local Privilege Escalation due to insecure DLL loading.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain `SYSTEM` level privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation by leveraging the vulnerable DLL loading mechanism within the Insight Agent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have local access to the machine where the vulnerable Insight Agent was installed.
