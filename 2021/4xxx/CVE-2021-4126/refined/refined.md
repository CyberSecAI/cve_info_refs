The provided content includes information about CVE-2021-4126.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Thunderbird incorrectly handles OpenPGP/MIME signed email messages with an additional outer MIME message layer. It only considered the inner signed message for signature validity, leading to a false impression that additional content was also covered by the signature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper verification of OpenPGP/MIME signatures when additional MIME layers are present.
- The vulnerability lies in Thunderbird's logic for checking OpenPGP signatures, specifically when a signed message is nested within another MIME part.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A user could be misled into believing that a signed email has not been tampered with when in fact, additional content outside of the signed portion could have been maliciously added or modified.
- This could lead to a user trusting forged or manipulated content in a signed email.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would send a crafted email with a legitimate OpenPGP signature in an inner MIME part. Then, they would add malicious or forged content as a separate, outer MIME part.
- The recipient's Thunderbird client would validate the inner part signature as valid, but not consider that additional content was not covered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send emails to the victim.
- The attacker should be capable of crafting emails with nested MIME structures, including one with a valid OpenPGP signature and one with malicious content.
