Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4313 (based on the pull request title and commit message indicating a SQL injection fix).

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of user-supplied data within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `$interval` variable in the `get_info` function and the `$country_code` variable in the `get_country_coor` function were being directly inserted into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the input for `$interval` or `$country_code`, an attacker could inject arbitrary SQL code into the queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to:
    - Access sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially gain further control of the system, depending on database permissions and the application's capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vectors are HTTP requests to the vulnerable application endpoints that call the `get_info` and `get_country_coor` functions. The attacker would need to manipulate the parameters used to call these functions (`interval` and `country_code`, respectively) to include malicious SQL syntax.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application endpoint that triggers the vulnerable code.
- **Understanding of SQL syntax:** Some understanding of SQL is required to craft a successful injection attack.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is present in the `server/index.php` file.
- The fix involves using prepared statements with parameterized queries, replacing direct string concatenation with placeholders (`:interval`, `:country_code`) and binding the user input to those parameters using PDO's `execute()` function.
- The vulnerable code before the fix:
```php
$sql .= " WHERE reg_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL $interval DAY)";
...
WHERE code = '$country_code'";
```
- The corrected code after the fix:
```php
$sql .= " WHERE reg_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL :interval DAY)";
...
WHERE code = ':country_code'";
```
and
```php
$stmt->execute(array(':interval' => intval($interval)));
...
$stmt->execute(array(':country_code' => $country_code));
```
This shows the use of prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
