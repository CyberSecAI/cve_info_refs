The content is related to CVE-2021-4022.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A use-after-free vulnerability occurs due to incorrect initialization of a structure member before it's freed. Specifically, when analyzing an ELF64 binary for the HPPA architecture, the `retctx.ret_reg` member of the `ReturnTypeAnalysisCtx` struct is freed without being initialized. This happens because a `goto` statement skips the initialization, and the subsequent free call operates on uninitialized stack data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can lead to a segmentation fault, crashing the rizin tool. In a release build, this could potentially lead to controlled memory corruption, as the uninitialized value used in `free` could be influenced to some degree by changing the block size during compilation.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by loading and analyzing a specially crafted ELF64 binary compiled for the HPPA architecture using `rizin` with the `-A` flag or the `aaa` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious ELF64 binary for HPPA architecture to be analyzed by the rizin tool.
