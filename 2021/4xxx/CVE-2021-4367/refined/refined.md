Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4367

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `flo_import_forms_options` AJAX action in the Flo Forms plugin lacks proper access control and security measures. Specifically:
  - It does not check for the `manage_options` capability, allowing any logged-in user to access it.
  - It lacks a security nonce, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
  - It does not sanitize the imported data, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** Low-privileged users can access functionality intended for administrators.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Lack of nonce protection allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of logged-in users without their consent.
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript can be injected and stored in the plugin settings due to insufficient sanitization of input, which is then executed when an administrator visits the settings page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Compromise:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that, when executed in the admin backend, can:
    - Install rogue plugins.
    - Create new admin accounts.
    - Backdoor the theme via the built-in theme editor.
    - Gain full control of the website.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify plugin settings and potentially gain access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be a logged-in user.
- **AJAX Action:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted request to the `flo_import_forms_options` AJAX endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the vulnerable WordPress site (any level, even subscriber).
- They need to be able to send crafted AJAX requests to the site.
- No social engineering is required, other than getting a user logged in to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was actively being exploited at the time of discovery.
- The injected JavaScript code was used to install a rogue plugin named "woocommerce-admin-demo" and create new admin accounts.
- The injected script also contained additional functionality such as theme backdooring.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.0.36 of the Flo Forms plugin.
