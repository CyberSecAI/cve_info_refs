Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of an outdated version of the TinyMCE text editor within Wocu Monitoring. This older version of TinyMCE fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**  The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious scripts can be injected and persistently stored within the application's data, specifically during report creation.
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The root cause of the XSS vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization by the TinyMCE editor.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Code Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into the application.
    *   **Data compromise:**  This could lead to sensitive data exfiltration, session hijacking, or other malicious actions performed in the context of other users' sessions.
    *   **Potential for Privilege escalation:** If an admin were to view the infected report, their privileges could be hijacked.
    *   **Malicious redirects**: injected scripts could be used to redirect users to external malicious resources.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Report Creation:** The vulnerability exists within the report creation functionality of Wocu Monitoring. The attacker would insert the malicious script through this feature.
    *   **Web Application:** The attack targets a web application, and successful attacks rely on manipulating inputs into a web-based text editor.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs a legitimate account with sufficient privileges to create and edit reports. This requirement implies that the attacker must have compromised a legitimate user account.
    *   **Access to Wocu Monitoring:** The attacker needs access to the Wocu Monitoring application, likely via its web interface.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-4035 and has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 3.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 48.2 of Wocu Monitoring, released on 03/12/2021.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by David Cámara Galindo from Telefónica Tech.
