Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-4228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded TLS certificate within the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hard-coded TLS Certificate:** The BMC firmware uses a static, pre-defined TLS certificate instead of generating a unique one or allowing administrators to configure their own. This certificate is present on the firmware version 1.00.0 of Lanner IAC-AST2500.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** An attacker can potentially intercept or manipulate encrypted communication between a client (e.g., a web browser or management application) and the BMC, as the attacker possesses a copy of the private key associated with the hard-coded certificate.
*   **Limited Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data. Availability can be impacted due to potential manipulation of commands or denial of service during the MitM attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the BMC to perform a MitM attack.
*   **Unspecified access point:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the network, depending on the accessibility of the BMC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the BMC to intercept communications.
*   **MitM Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the client and the BMC.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Requires a degree of technical sophistication to perform MitM attack.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text states that this vulnerability (CVE-2021-4228) was found in version 1.00.0 of the Lanner IAC-AST2500 firmware, while other vulnerabilities were found in version 1.10.0.
*   The vulnerability is rated as CVSS v3.1 5.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).
