The provided content relates to CVE-2021-4297.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `sourcefilename` parameter in the JOBE application's API, which allowed for path traversal. Specifically, the application did not properly sanitize the provided filename, allowing attackers to use sequences like "../../" to save files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability.
- Insufficient input validation on the `sourcefilename` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: By using path traversal to write files to the web directory, attackers could execute arbitrary PHP code and potentially gain root access to the server.
- Arbitrary file write: Ability to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem, potentially overwriting important system files.
- Code execution: Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `runs_post` API endpoint with a malicious `sourcefilename` parameter.
- The attacker needs to craft the request, including the `sourcecode`, `language_id` and the malicious `sourcefilename`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the JOBE API.
- The attacker needs to be able to specify the `sourcefilename` parameter in the request.
