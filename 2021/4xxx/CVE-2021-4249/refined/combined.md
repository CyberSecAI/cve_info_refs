### @jgm **[jgm](/jgm)** commented [Feb 25, 2021](#issue-816024897)

This puts a limit on recursion depth (10) to avoid loops and other attacks.

Fixes [#103](https://github.com/snoyberg/xml/issues/103).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| OK, I've changed this, adding a new adjustable parameter for the max size of any single entity expansion, and better code for avoiding loops. I've also added more tests. |

```
Entity expansion loops are detected and avoided.

In addition, there is a limit on the length of an
entity expansion (to guard against attacks like the
billion laughs attack). This can be adjusted using
the new exported field `psEntityExpansionSizeLimit`
on ParseSettings. By default it is set at 8192.

Add tests, including a test for the billion laughs attack.
