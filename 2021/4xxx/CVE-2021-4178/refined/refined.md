{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an insecure deserialization issue within the `unmarshalYaml` method of the fabric8 Kubernetes client. This method used the SnakeYAML library without proper configuration, allowing for the potential execution of arbitrary code through maliciously crafted YAML input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization due to improper configuration of the SnakeYAML library.",
      "Lack of input sanitization or validation when processing YAML data.",
      "Use of unsafe constructors in SnakeYAML."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running the vulnerable application. This could result in complete compromise of the affected system, including data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attackers with high privileges can exploit this by supplying malicious YAML data through the vulnerable `unmarshalYaml` method.",
      "Potentially, any path where user-controlled YAML data is parsed by the affected library may be an attack vector"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would require local access and high privileges to supply malicious YAML to the vulnerable component. This could involve exploiting an existing vulnerability or having authorized, but potentially compromised access to the system. Network based attacks were not explicitly described, but might be feasible via code injection if user-controlled YAML is parsed.",
    "cve": "CVE-2021-4178"
