Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-4368:

**Root Cause:**

The primary root cause is the lack of proper authorization checks, security nonces, and input sanitization in the "Frontend File Manager" WordPress plugin. This allows unauthenticated and lower-privileged users to perform actions they should not be able to, leading to several vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Privilege Escalation:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `wpfm_get_current_user` function allows users to override the current user ID using the `file_owner` parameter.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure handling of user ID retrieval.
2.  **Unauthenticated Content Injection and Stored XSS:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `wpfm_edit_file_title_desc` AJAX action does not verify user authorization or use a security nonce. The `file_title` parameter is sanitized using `esc_attr`, which is insufficient for preventing XSS when the title is echoed outside HTML attributes.
    *   **Weakness:** Missing authorization checks and insufficient sanitization.
3.  **Authenticated Settings Change and Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `wpfm_save_settings` AJAX action lacks capability checks and a security nonce, allowing any authenticated user to modify the plugin's settings. An attacker could allow the upload of PHP files and achieve RCE using the `wpfm_upload_file` AJAX action.
    *   **Weakness:** Missing authorization and nonce checks on settings update.
4.  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `wpfm_delete_file` AJAX action does not verify if the user is authorized to delete the specified post and lacks a security nonce.
    *   **Weakness:** Missing authorization and nonce checks on post deletion.
5.  **Unauthenticated Post Meta Change and Arbitrary File Download:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `wpfm_file_meta_update` AJAX action allows unauthorized users to modify post meta data without sanitization. This could lead to arbitrary file downloads, among other issues.
    *   **Weakness:** Missing authorization, nonce checks and sanitization on meta updates.
6.  **Unauthenticated HTML Injection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `wpfm_send_file_in_email` AJAX action allows unauthenticated users to send emails, including an unsanitized message body.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of sanitization of the message body in email functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could gain higher privileges.
*   **Content Injection/XSS:** Attackers can inject arbitrary content and Javascript code. This could lead to account takeovers, defacement, etc..
*   **Arbitrary File Upload/RCE:** Attackers could upload and execute arbitrary PHP code.
*   **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** Attackers could delete posts.
*  **Arbitrary File Download:** Attackers could download sensitive files.
*  **Spam Relay:** Attackers could use the blog as a spam relay.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX actions (`wpfm_edit_file_title_desc`, `wpfm_save_settings`, `wpfm_delete_file`, `wpfm_file_meta_update`, `wpfm_send_file_in_email` etc.)
*   Manipulation of `$_GET` and `$_REQUEST` parameters (`file_owner`, `file_id`, `file_title`, `file_content`, `wpfm_file_types` and others).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Attacks:** Many of the vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
*   **Authenticated Attacks:** Some of the vulnerabilities require an authenticated user but with minimal privileges (subscriber level).
*   **Network Access:** Attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.
