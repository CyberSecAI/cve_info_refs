## SP Project & Document Manager <= 4.22 - Authenticated Shell Upload

## Description

```
This issue is the bypass for https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/8f6e82d5-c0e9-468e-acb8-7cd549f6a45a. The author has limited to upload a file of 'x.pHp', but we can upload a file like '1.php.' .If the target is running on windows environment， it will save as '1.php'

```

## Affects Plugins

```
sp-client-document-manager <= 4.22
https://wordpress.org/plugins/sp-client-document-manager/

```

## Author

```
pang0lin@webray.com.cn inc

```

## Condition

```
Windows environment

```

## Proof of Concept

1. Create the SP Project & Document Manager page such as 'sp-document'
2. Upload a file and intercept the request.
3. Rename the dlg-upload-file[] parameter from '1.txt' with '1.php.' , it is very important the filename endswith 'php.' .

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SP Project & Document Manager < 4.24 - Subscriber+ Shell Upload

### Description

The plugin allows any authenticated users, such as subscribers, to upload files. The plugin attempts to prevent PHP and other similar files that could be executed on the server from being uploaded by checking the file extension. It was discovered that on Windows servers, the security checks in place were insufficient, enabling bad actors to potentially upload backdoors on vulnerable sites.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create the SP Project & Document Manager page such as 'sp-document'
2. Upload a file and intercept the request.
3. Rename the dlg-upload-file[] parameter from '1.txt' with '1.php.' , it is very important the filename endswith 'php.' .

### Affects Plugins
