Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `pcapng_process_options` function, specifically within the pcapng file parser of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:**  A malformed pcapng file can cause a heap-based buffer overflow when the `pcapng_process_options` function attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** Exploitation leads to a crash of Wireshark, as confirmed by the AddressSanitizer report and vulnerability description.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crashing Wireshark, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition, preventing users from analyzing network traffic with the tool.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious pcapng file:** The attack vector is a specially crafted, malicious pcapng file. This file contains malformed or oversized options within a block, triggering the overflow when parsed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create malformed pcapng file:** The attacker must be able to create a pcapng file with the specific structure to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Convince a user to open the file:** The attacker needs to trick a Wireshark user into opening this malformed file using the tool. This could be through phishing emails, social engineering, or hosting the file on an untrusted source.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Shaohua Li.
*   The vulnerability is present in Wireshark version 3.6.0, and fixed in version 3.6.1 and later.
*   The vulnerability is also identified as  WNPA-SEC-2021-19
*  The vulnerability is considered to be of low severity and exploitable remotely.
*  The AddressSanitizer report shows a read of size 2 at memory location 0x60c000001820 which is 32 bytes to the right of the allocated memory 0x60c000001780, allocated with a size of 128 bytes
* The vulnerable code is inside `pcapng.c` file.

In summary, CVE-2021-4183 is a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in Wireshark's pcapng file parser. An attacker can craft a malicious pcapng file and induce a crash, thus causing a denial of service by tricking someone into opening it in Wireshark.
