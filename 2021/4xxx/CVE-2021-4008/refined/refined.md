    "description": "The handler for the CompositeGlyphs request of the Render extension does not properly validate the request length leading to out of bounds memory write.",
    "root_cause": "Improper input validation in the `SProcRenderCompositeGlyphs` function within the Render extension.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory write due to insufficient validation of request length."
