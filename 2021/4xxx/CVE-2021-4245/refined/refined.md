Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4245:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `rfc6902` JavaScript library was vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. This occurred because the library allowed modification of object prototypes by injecting properties into them using the `applyPatch` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability lies in the ability to modify the `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` attributes of JavaScript objects. By injecting properties into these attributes, an attacker can modify the behavior of all objects in the application via prototype inheritance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information by polluting the prototype.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying prototype properties, attackers could disrupt the normal operation of the application and cause a denial of service.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some cases, prototype pollution vulnerabilities can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `applyPatch` function of the `rfc6902` library.
*   An attacker can craft a malicious patch with `op: 'add'` and a path that targets the `__proto__`, `constructor` or `prototype` attributes, and inject arbitrary values to these attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `rfc6902.applyPatch` function.
*   The attacker must be able to control the `path` and `value` parameters of the patch operation.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is demonstrated by modifying the `polluted` property of the base `Object.prototype` by injecting the property with `__proto__` path.
*   The fix implemented in the commit `c006ce9` prevents this by explicitly checking for `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` keys during the path processing and skipping these keys.
*   The fix modifies the `pointer.ts` file to include the conditional check for the mentioned keys, using `if (key == '__proto__' || key == 'constructor' || key == 'prototype') { continue }`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported on huntr.dev and assigned the id `1-npm-rfc6902`
*   The fix was initially introduced in a pull request `418sec#1` and was later merged into the main repository.
*   The original pull request introduced a less performant method for checking the blocked keys `['__proto__', 'constructor', 'prototype'].includes(key)` which was later reverted.
*   The fix skips over the polluting keys without throwing an error.
*   A later commit `2b3fa83` in dalle/rfc6902 further fixes prototype pollution and deep paths by modifying `Pointer#set` to use `Pointer#evaluate`.
