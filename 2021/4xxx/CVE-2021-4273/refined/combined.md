### @RifeWang **[RifeWang](/RifeWang)** commented [Feb 18, 2021](#issue-811170759)

修复了以下两个问题：

* 当搜索请求异常时，`data["pageHtml"]` 无数据会导致 html.Render 异常，从而显示空白页面。
* 搜索框此处未对 XSS 漏洞进行处理， [点击查看 XSS 漏洞](https://studygolang.com/search?q=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E)。

Sorry, something went wrong.
