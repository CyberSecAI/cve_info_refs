The provided content relates to a commit in the `pimcore/pimcore` repository on GitHub, which addresses a vulnerability. The commit message states "[Admin] Logout action should use POST method". This indicates a change in how the logout functionality is handled, moving from a GET request to a POST request. This change is likely related to a security vulnerability, where GET requests could potentially be exploited, for example through CSRF.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The logout action was initially implemented using a GET request, which is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   CSRF vulnerability: The logout action could be triggered by a malicious website or email without the user's knowledge or consent, because it was a GET request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   An attacker could force a logged-in user to log out of the application without their consent, potentially disrupting their work or causing denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
-   CSRF attacks can be performed using a malicious website, email, or other means to trick a logged-in user's browser into sending a logout request to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website or interacting with a malicious email. The attacker needs no privileged position within the target application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The commit changes the logout route to accept only POST requests:
    *   `@Route("/logout", name="pimcore_admin_logout" , methods={"POST"})` is added in `bundles/AdminBundle/Controller/Admin/LoginController.php`.
*   The logout link in `bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Index/index.html.twig` is changed from a simple `<a>` tag to a form with a POST method and a hidden CSRF token. A link using javascript to submit the form is now used:
    *   `<form id="pimcore_logout_form" method="post" action="{{ path('pimcore_admin_logout') }}">`
    *   `<input type="hidden" name="csrfToken" value="{{ pimcore_csrf.getCsrfToken() }}">`
    *   `<a id="pimcore_logout" data-menu-tooltip="{{ "logout"|trans([],'admin') }}" href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('pimcore_logout_form').submit();" style="display: none">`
*   The logout link in `bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Login/twoFactorAuthentication.html.twig` was also updated to use a form and POST, similar to `index.html.twig`

This commit changes the logout action to use a POST request and includes a CSRF token to prevent CSRF attacks by an attacker. The provided content does provide more detail than the placeholder CVE description, explaining the precise nature of the fix.
