Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-4370:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities is a combination of missing authorization checks, lack of security nonces, and insufficient data validation within the uListing WordPress plugin. These weaknesses are present in both the AJAX API and a custom WP_Route API implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** Most actions and endpoints are accessible to unauthenticated users.
*   **Missing Security Nonces:**  The plugin fails to use security nonces, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Insufficient Data Validation:** User-supplied data is not properly sanitized or validated, leading to potential SQL injection and other issues.
*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Account Creation:** Unauthenticated users can create new accounts with arbitrary roles including administrative.
*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Account Change:** Unauthenticated users can modify existing user accounts.
*   **Unauthenticated WordPress Options Change:** Unauthenticated users can change any WordPress option in the database.
*   **Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated users can retrieve a list of all users and their email addresses.
*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Roles and Capabilities Creation/Deletion:** Unauthenticated users can add or delete roles and capabilities.
*   **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** Two instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation in  `listing_id`,  `user_id` parameters and IP address from untrusted sources.
*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post/Page Deletion:** Unauthenticated users can delete any post or page on the blog.
*   **Additional Issues:**  Unauthenticated WordPress options deletion, plugin settings change, post/page status change, post meta deletion and change, and others.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Complete Takeover:** Attackers could create admin accounts, change site URLs, modify any option, change user roles or delete any content, leading to complete takeover of the website.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive user information, including email addresses.
*   **Website Defacement:** Unauthenticated users can delete pages and posts.
*   **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers can redirect website traffic to external malicious websites.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Through database modification it is possible to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP requests:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the plugin's AJAX API endpoints or custom WP_Route API endpoints.
*   **Character encoding:** The plugin's WP_Route API allows character encoding making bypassing poorly configured firewalls and security plugins possible.
*   **Forged IP addresses:** The SQL injection via IP address can be exploited by sending a forged HTTP header containing a malicious IP address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the website to exploit most of these vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
*   **No special position:** The attacker doesn't require any special position or privilege on the target system.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Jerome Bruandet from NinTechNet.
*   The vendor was contacted on January 11, 2021, but the issue was not resolved until escalated to the WordPress Plugins Team, with a patched version (1.7) released on January 19, 2021.
*   The patched version includes additional security nonces, data sanitization, and user role capability checkers, aiming to address these vulnerabilities.
