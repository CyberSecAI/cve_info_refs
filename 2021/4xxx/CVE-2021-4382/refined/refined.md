Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4382:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- **Missing file type validation:** The `fetch_external_image()` function in the "Recently" WordPress plugin lacks proper validation of file types when fetching external images. This allows uploading arbitrary files, not just images.
- **Code injection:**  The plugin was also vulnerable to code injection, which, combined with the arbitrary file upload, allowed for remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload files of any type, including executable ones, due to the lack of file type validation in the `fetch_external_image()` function.
- **Code injection:**  The plugin was vulnerable to code injection, meaning an attacker could insert malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) and then executing them, attackers can gain control over the affected website.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running the application.
- **Compromise of application and database:** Attackers could potentially compromise the application itself, the underlying database, access, or modify data.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The Acunetix description mentions cross-site scripting vulnerability. Although the other sources focus on the arbitrary file upload and remote code execution aspect.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network-based attacks**: Vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web interface.
- **File Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious files using the plugin's image fetching functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site to exploit the arbitrary file upload vulnerability. The level of privileges is not explicitly stated but is implied as a user who can access the image upload functionality.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin:** Attackers need to know the "Recently" plugin is installed and the version is vulnerable.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.0.5 of the "Recently" plugin.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity.
- The issue was reported by Jerome Bruandet of NinTechNet.
- The patch included fixes for XSS, code injection, and other bugs.
- The CVSS scores are:
  - **CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H** (Wordfence) for the file upload vulnerability.
  - **CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H** (WPScan) for the code injection vulnerability, although this appears to be a separate vulnerability that was fixed in the same release, 3.0.5.

The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, especially in detailing the code injection vulnerability, the affected function (`fetch_external_image`), and the exact file type validation issue.
