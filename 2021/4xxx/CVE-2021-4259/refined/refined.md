The provided content is related to CVE-2021-4259.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by using a weak comparison (`!=`) instead of a strict comparison (`!==`) when validating the HTTP Digest authentication response. This allows for a "magic hash" attack where a specially crafted hash can bypass the authentication check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak comparison (`!=`) in the authentication logic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the application, bypassing the HTTP Digest authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request with a "magic hash" as the response in the Digest authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker does not need valid credentials but needs to know the digest parameters (realm, nonce, etc.), which are usually part of the authentication challenge.
