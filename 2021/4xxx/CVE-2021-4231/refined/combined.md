This is a follow up fix for
[894286d](https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/894286dd0c92b5af223364237e63798e18b14f58).

It turns out that comments can be closed in several ways:
- `<!-->`
- `<!-- -->`
- `<!-- --!>`

All of the above are valid ways to close comment per:
<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#comments>

The new fix surrounds `<` and `>` with zero width space so that it
renders in the same way, but it prevents the comment to be closed eagerly.

## How to fix?

Upgrade `@angular/core` to version 11.0.5, 11.1.0-next.3 or higher.

## Overview

[@angular/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40angular/core) is a package that lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It also lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in development, with SSR enabled.

## Details

A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.

This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.

Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.

The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.

### Types of attacks

There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

| Type | Origin | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
| **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
| **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
| **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

### Affected environments

The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

* Web servers
* Application servers
* Web application environments

### How to prevent

This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:

* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.
* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
* Redirect invalid requests.
* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

3.9 low

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component allowing access to component-wide settings and files.

  **High**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

### @mhevery **[mhevery](/mhevery)** commented [Dec 15, 2020](#issue-768203567)

Escape the content of the strings so that it can be safely inserted into a comment node.

The issue is that HTML does not specify any way to escape comment end text inside the comment. `<!-- The way you close a comment is with "-->". -->`. Above the `"-->"` is meant to be text not an end to the comment. This can be created programmatically through DOM APIs.

```
div.innerHTML = div.innerHTML

```

One would expect that the above code would be safe to do, but it turns out that because comment text is not escaped, the comment may contain text which will prematurely close the comment opening up the application for XSS attack. (In SSR we programmatically create comment nodes which may contain such text and expect them to be safe.)

This function escapes the comment text by looking for the closing char sequence `-->` and replace it with `-_-_>` where the `_` is a zero width space `\u200B`. The result is that if a comment contains `-->` text it will render normally but it will not cause the HTML parser to close the comment.

`[fix(core): fix possible XSS attack in development through SSR.](/angular/angular/pull/40136/commits/894286dd0c92b5af223364237e63798e18b14f58 "fix(core): fix possible XSS attack in development through SSR.

Escape the content of the strings so that it can be safely inserted into a comment node.
The issue is that HTML does not specify any way to escape comment end text inside the comment.
`<!-- The way you close a comment is with \"-->\". -->`. Above the `\"-->\"` is meant to be text
not an end to the comment. This can be created programmatically through DOM APIs.

```
div.innerHTML = div.innerHTML
```
One would expect that the above code would be safe to do, but it turns out that because comment
text is not escaped, the comment may contain text which will prematurely close the comment
opening up the application for XSS attack. (In SSR we programmatically create comment nodes which
may contain such text and expect them to be safe.)
This function escapes the comment text by looking for the closing char sequence `-->` and replace
it with `-_-_>` where the `_` is a zero width space `\u200B`. The result is that if a comment
contains `-->` text it will render normally but it will not cause the HTML parser to close the
comment.")`

OOC, why use two `\u200B`s? Wouldn't `--\u200B>` also work?
