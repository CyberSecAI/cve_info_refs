Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4231:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that HTML does not provide a way to escape comment end text within HTML comments. Specifically, sequences like `-->`, `>`,`--!>` or `<!--`  within a comment could prematurely close the comment, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This can occur when comment nodes are programmatically created, such as during Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and contain such unescaped text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. By crafting comment text with specific sequences (e.g. `-->`, `>`,`--!>`,`<!--`), an attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed when the comment is rendered in the browser.
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The lack of proper sanitization of comment text, specifically the failure to escape characters that could be interpreted as comment delimiters, is a key weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Code Injection:** Attackers could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code in the context of the vulnerable application, potentially leading to:
    - **Data Theft:** Stealing user cookies and session data.
    - **Session Hijacking:** Taking over user sessions.
    - **Information Exposure:** Accessing sensitive data.
    - **Malware Delivery:** Distributing malicious software to users.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining unauthorized access to privileged functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Comment Text:** An attacker crafts malicious comment content with comment delimiters. This content is then included in a comment node, particularly in SSR scenarios.
- **DOM Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the DOM, where comment nodes are dynamically created or updated with malicious data.
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**:  The vulnerability is particularly relevant in applications using server-side rendering, where comment nodes are created on the server and sent to the client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject Data:** The attacker needs the ability to influence the content of comment nodes, usually through a vulnerability that allows data injection into the application.
- **Understanding of HTML Comments:** Knowledge of how HTML comments are parsed is necessary to craft malicious payloads that will exploit this vulnerability.
- **Development/SSR Context:** The attacker needs to target application in a development environment using SSR where the vulnerability is present.

**Mitigation:**
The fix involves escaping the comment text by replacing any occurrences of comment delimiters with their escaped versions using zero width space `\u200B`. For example,  `<` becomes `\u200B<\u200B`, `>` becomes `\u200B>\u200B`, and `-->` is replaced with `--\u200B>\u200B`. This prevents the HTML parser from prematurely closing the comment when processing the malicious payload, hence preventing the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes code changes that implement the fix, including modifications to `packages/core/src/util/dom.ts` and accompanying tests.
- The fix is specifically targeted towards SSR scenarios in development environments.
- The vulnerability affects versions of `@angular/core` prior to 11.0.5 and versions between 11.1.0-next.0 and 11.1.0-next.3.
