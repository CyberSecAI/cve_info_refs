fix(json-deserializer): fixed codeQL vulnerability

```
Removed the regex used to identify a JSON mime-type as this was potentially vulnerable to
'Regular expression Denial of Service attacks' and making changes to make the regex more restrictive (but compliant with RFC 6838) did not pass tests for this issue online.

This now matches based on the last segment of a mimetype being json or json; this should match all the expected mime types.

Updated unit-tests with additional tests for a variety of compatible mime types.

### @matt-jenner **[matt-jenner](/matt-jenner)** commented [Jul 25, 2021](#issue-952273131)

This implements a json-deserializer middleware, it expects an object extending ApiGatewayProxyEvent and returns an ApiGatewayProxyObjectEvent which replaces the string body for an object of type `Record<string, unknown>`.

It introduces the concept of a `RequestBodyNotJsonError` to be used to catch and return an appropriate 400 error back if a non json payload is passed.

If no body or a non-json header is passed it will pass null as the body property on the event passed to the underlying handler.

Closes [#54](https://github.com/dbartholomae/lambda-middleware/issues/54)

## Checklist:

* I have updated the documentation accordingly.
* I have read the **CONTRIBUTING** document.

I'm sorry for the delays in supplying this PR, but things got crazily busy at work, and then summer (and a large DIY project - building a garden office now my work has decided no-one is going back to the office full-time) happened which I'm afraid took most of my spare time and I like to code when fully able to commit myself to it.

Although I mostly got this done within a few hours work. I ran into an issue with the 100% code-coverage requirements which caused me to delay submiting. While I do have full coverage in TS (and I always like to see with libraries I expect someone to depend upon), there was one issue where the `super(message)` line in the `RequestBodyNotJsonError` class would NOT mark itself as covered despite definately hitting the line in my tests.

Jest reports the line as not-covered due to the coverage being applied to ES5 code rather than the TS itself. I've confirmed coverage is 100% as if you switch the output to ES6 it reports 100% coverage.

After reading quite a bit around the issue, it seems to relate to the fact that when the TS line:

`super(message)`

is transpiled down to ES5, it comes out as:

`var _this = _super.call(this, message) || this;`

While the former part of the or statement is covered, it doesn't cover all the cases of the transpiled statement fully.

I've tried various approaches to resolve this including a suggestion of adding `https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-es5-istanbul-coverage` but eventually thought it best to submit it cleanly without this and see your thoughts.

See here for more information:

* [Emitted code for super() results in 'Branch not covered' in coverage reports. microsoft/TypeScript#13029](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13029)
* [Typescript extended classes show branch error SitePen/remap-istanbul#106](https://github.com/SitePen/remap-istanbul/issues/106)

Otherwise, hopefully the PR should be otherwise mostly self-explanatory, the logic itself is very simple and is the precursor for my other feature request logged in [#55](https://github.com/dbartholomae/lambda-middleware/issues/55).

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks for waiting! I've added comments to make it easy to add the status code to the error. I'll also check why CI isn't running on this PR. There might need to run `rush change` to also add a changelog. But CI should tell us.

| Thanks for the review, I hope you had a good holiday. I've added your suggestions and fixed one codeQL vulnerability relating to Regular expression denial of service (it was simpler to just remove the regex 🙂).  It's running the build now but for some reason it's not seeing my package in the build, it lists 13 packages not the 14 I see if I run `rush test:integration` or `rush test:unit` locally and the project is listed in `rush.json` so I would have thought it would have picked it up?  Any ideas on this front as I'm afraid I'm not a rush expert, thanks 🙂. |

| Thanks for the approval - it will feel good to finally get this in, I think you need to merge this manually though as mergify is complaining that the workflow has changed. Once this is in, I can start on the next issue I logged to create the io-ts validator middleware before I'm due back in work next week, thanks 🙂. |

| Thanks! I now figured out the problem: When I changed the settings to run the GitHub actions for this PR, I changed them in a way that lead to actions running on the main branch code instead of the PR branch code instead. I've just updated the main branch to fix this. If you could rebase/merge main one more time, it should be solved :) |
