Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4148:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of the `block_invalidatepage()` function in the Linux kernel's filesystem buffer management. Specifically, the function lacks proper handling of Transparent Huge Pages (THP) and incorrectly assumes a single page size, leading to a BUG when processing huge pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Size Check:** The `block_invalidatepage()` function checks if the provided size exceeds `PAGE_SIZE`, which is incorrect for huge pages, leading to a BUG.
- **Lack of THP Awareness:**  The function and other invalidatepage implementations are not fully THP-aware, assuming single page sizes, and hardcoding the `PAGE_SIZE`. This can lead to crashes or other errors.
- **Potential Refcount Pinning:** The private flag (`PG_private`) is managed per subpage in a THP. Incorrect handling during invalidation might prevent THP from being split or reclaimed, because multiple subpages could have private data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** An attacker can trigger a kernel crash by exploiting the improper size check, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A local user with user privileges can trigger the vulnerability by manipulating the filesystem operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local user privileges on a system with the vulnerable kernel.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `block_invalidatepage()` function with a huge page and incorrect size parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The `block_invalidatepage()` function's check `BUG_ON(stop > PAGE_SIZE || stop < length)` was incorrect and has been updated to `BUG_ON(stop > thp_size(page) || stop < length)`.
- The issue arises because the function incorrectly assumes a single page size (`PAGE_SIZE`) when dealing with huge pages where `length` could be the size of the huge page itself.

**Patch Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by a patch that modifies the `block_invalidatepage()` function to use `thp_size(page)` instead of `PAGE_SIZE` for size checks and also considers huge page sizes.
- The fix was included in Linux kernel version 5.14.16 and later.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug report includes links to mailing list discussions (lkml.org) where the vulnerability was initially reported and patched.
- The provided Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability and its resolution.
