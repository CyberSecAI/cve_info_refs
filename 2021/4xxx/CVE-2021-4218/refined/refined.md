Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's implementation of reading SVC RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) counters. Specifically, accessing the counter via sysctl leads to a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of sysctl read operations related to SVC RDMA counters. Reading the counter triggers a kernel panic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit results in a system crash, forcing a reboot. This disrupts normal system operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access and the ability to read sysctl parameters.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was discovered in the context of the `rpcrdma` module of the Linux kernel.
- The vulnerability was identified and fixed in CentOS Stream before it was released in RHEL.
- The bug report indicates that the bug is closed with status "NOTABUG". However the description of the vulnerability still points to the fact that this is a flaw in the kernel's implementation, meaning that even if it was caught before release and patched, it is still a vulnerability.
