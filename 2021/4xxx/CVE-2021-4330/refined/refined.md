Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4330

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient file type validation during the extraction of uploaded ZIP files. Specifically, the `installFreeTemplateKit` and `uploadTemplateKitZipFile` functions within the Envato Elements and Template Kit plugins failed to properly validate file types within the ZIP archive being extracted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload arbitrary files due to the lack of proper file type checks during ZIP extraction.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code did not adequately validate the types of files being extracted from the uploaded ZIP archive.
- The vulnerable code used `unzip_file`, which does not have any file type validation, and was later replaced with code using `ZipArchive` with a whitelist of allowed file types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):** Attackers could upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) within a ZIP archive. If these files are extracted to a location accessible by the web server, it can potentially lead to remote code execution on the server, leading to complete compromise of the website.
- **Data Breach and Defacement:**  Successful exploitation may also lead to data breaches, website defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attack vector is through uploading a specially crafted ZIP file containing malicious code through the vulnerable functions in the plugins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:** An attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to upload ZIP files through the plugins' interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects "Envato Elements – Photos & Elementor Templates" plugin versions <= 2.0.10 and "Template Kit – Import" plugin versions <= 1.0.13.
- Patched versions are 2.0.11 for Envato Elements and 1.0.14 for Template Kit, respectively.
- The fix involved switching to using `ZipArchive` for extraction and adding a whitelist of allowed file types (`json`, `jpg`, `png`, `css`, `html`).
- The original vulnerable code used `unzip_file` which did not perform file type validation.
