  "CVE-2021-4091": {
    "description": "A double free was found in the way 389-ds-base handles virtual attributes context in persistent searches. An attacker could send a series of search requests, forcing the server to behave unexpectedly, and crash.",
    "root_cause": "When a worker thread processes a persistent search, it duplicates the private pblock and spawns a dedicated thread to handle the persistent search. It will later free that cloned pblock. However, both pblock (original an cloned) refer to the same virtual attribute context, resulting in the context be freed once per pblock instance.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double Free"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could send a series of search requests, forcing the server to behave unexpectedly, and crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a series of search requests"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send LDAP search requests to a vulnerable 389-ds server"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in 389-ds-base version 1.3.6.4 and newer (including 1.4 and 2.0) and was introduced by commit 74c666b83e3e1789c2ef3f7935c327bd7555193e. The fix was introduced in commit a3c298f8140d3e4fa1bd5a670f1bb965a21a9b7b."
