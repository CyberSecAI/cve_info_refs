Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4338:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `open_redirect` and `save_redirect` functions of the "404 to 301" WordPress plugin. These functions, which are responsible for viewing, creating, and editing redirections, were only protected by a nonce check, which is insufficient for access control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Access Control (Broken Access Control):** The plugin fails to properly verify if the user has the required capability to perform the action (view/create/edit redirection). It relies solely on a nonce, which is meant for CSRF protection, not authorization.
- **Missing Capability Checks:** The `open_redirect` and `save_redirect` functions lack checks to verify if the current user has the necessary permissions to perform those actions.
- **Reliance on Nonce for Authentication:** The plugin incorrectly uses security nonces as a primary method of authentication, instead of proper capability checks, which exposes the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Redirection Creation/Modification:** An attacker could create and modify redirects, potentially sending users to malicious sites.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can redirect users to fake login pages and steal credentials.
- **Spamming:** Attackers can create redirects to hide spam links by triggering 404 errors on specific URLs, logging them, and then setting up a redirect.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
- **AJAX actions:** The vulnerable functions are exposed via AJAX actions (`wp_ajax_jj4t3_redirect_thickbox` and `wp_ajax_jj4t3_redirect_form`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the WordPress site. This could be any user with an account on the site, not necessarily an administrator.
- **Knowledge of Nonce:** The attacker needs to retrieve the nonce value, which is leaked in the HTML source code of every backend page due to its use within the `admin_footer` hook.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to craft HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints, including the nonce and the desired redirect information.
