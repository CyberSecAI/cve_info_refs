The provided content contains information about a commit that addresses a vulnerability related to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the `naturalSort()` function of the `string-kit` library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The original `naturalSort()` function used regular expressions for tokenizing strings, which was slow and vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **ReDoS vulnerability:** The use of complex regular expressions in the previous implementation was susceptible to ReDoS attacks, which could cause the function to become unresponsive when processing specially crafted strings.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could craft input strings that exploit the vulnerable regular expressions, causing the `naturalSort()` function to consume excessive processing time and resources, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

- By providing specific input strings to the `naturalSort()` function, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability. This would likely occur through software or applications that use the vulnerable `string-kit` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide input to the `naturalSort()` function through the application or system using the vulnerable library. No specific privileges are needed.

**Mitigation:**
The commit replaces the old RegExp based `naturalSort()` function with a new implementation that avoids regular expressions. It uses character code comparison and a state-machine approach to parse and compare strings. This change fixes the ReDoS vulnerability and improves performance.
