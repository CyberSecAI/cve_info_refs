Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-4339:

**1.  Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided blog and Wordfence articles directly reference CVE-2021-4339 and describe an "Unauthenticated Information Disclosure" vulnerability in the uListing plugin, as does the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The primary root cause is the lack of proper authorization checks and security nonces in various API endpoints of the uListing WordPress plugin. This allows unauthenticated users to perform actions they should not be able to.

**3.  Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Broken Access Control:** Numerous endpoints, both AJAX and WP_Route based, are accessible without authentication or proper permission checks.
   - **Missing Authorization:**  Lack of checks to verify if the user is authorized to perform the requested actions (e.g., user role verification, login status checks, security nonces).
   - **SQL Injection:** Two instances of SQL injection are identified due to unsanitized input in  `listing_id` and `user_id` GET parameters, as well as unsanitized IP addresses.
   - **WordPress Options Modification:** Unauthenticated users can modify any WordPress option in the database by exploiting AJAX and WP_Route endpoints.
   - **Arbitrary Post/Page Deletion:**  Unauthenticated users can delete any post or page via an exposed API endpoint, with no verification of ownership or user capability.
   - **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated users can retrieve user lists including emails via the /ulisting-user/search route.
   - **Arbitrary Roles/Capabilities Creation/Deletion:** Unauthenticated users can add/remove roles and capabilities to the blog by using an exposed API endpoint.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Complete Site Takeover:**  By creating a new administrator account or modifying an existing one, attackers gain full control over the WordPress site.
   - **Data Breaches:** Sensitive information like user lists, emails, and potentially other database data can be exposed.
   - **Site Defacement:** Attackers could modify the `siteurl` option to redirect all traffic to a malicious site or deface content.
   - **Arbitrary Data Manipulation:**  Attackers can modify post meta, user meta and user profile pictures.
   - **Denial of Service:** By deleting critical posts/pages or by modifying essential WordPress settings.
   - **Bypass Security:** Poorly implemented security rules on websites can be bypassed using light obfuscation.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through maliciously crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoints (AJAX and WP_Route) of the plugin.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress website to exploit these vulnerabilities.
   - **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress website.

**Additional Notes:**
 - The blog post from nintechnet.com provides extensive details including specific vulnerable files, function names, and code snippets, that goes far beyond a basic CVE description.
- The Wordfence article confirms the findings but focuses on the "Unauthenticated Information Disclosure" via /1/api/ulisting-user/search route.
- The plugin's commit history on plugins.trac.wordpress.org shows that these issues were addressed in version 1.7.
