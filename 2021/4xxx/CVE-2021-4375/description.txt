The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the usces_download_system_information() function in versions up to, and including, 2.2.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to download information including WordPress settings, plugin settings, PHP settings and server settings.
