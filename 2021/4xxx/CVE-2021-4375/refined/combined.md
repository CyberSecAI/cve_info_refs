### Description

The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the usces\_download\_system\_information() function in versions up to, and including, 2.2.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to download information including WordPress settings, plugin settings, PHP settings and server settings.

# WordPress Welcart e-Commerce plugin fixed vulnerabilities.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [August 6, 2021 - 11:36am [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-welcart-e-commerce-plugin-fixed-vulnerabilities/)

The WordPress [Welcart e-Commerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/usc-e-shop/) plugin (20,000+ active installations) fixed multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities affecting version 2.2.7 and below.

### Unauthenticated Information Disclosure

CVSS v3.1: [7.5 (high)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Welcart e-Commerce allows the administrator to download, in CSV format, three types of list: products, orders and members list.

Here’s an example of the data exported in the members list:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/usc-e-shop_vulnerability.png)

The related code can be found in the “usc-e-shop/extensions/DataListUpgrade/data\_list\_upgrade.php” script:

```
public function __construct() {

   self::initialize_data();

   if ( is_admin() ) {

      add_action( 'usces_action_admin_system_extentions', array( $this, 'setting_form' ) );
      add_action( 'init', array( $this, 'save_data' ) );

      if ( self::$opts['orderlist_flag'] ) {
         if ( isset( $_REQUEST['order_action'] ) && 'dlordernewlist' == $_REQUEST['order_action'] ) {
            add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'download_order_list' ) );
         } elseif ( isset( $_REQUEST['order_action'] ) && 'dlproductnewlist' == $_REQUEST['order_action'] ) {
            add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'download_orderdetail_list' ) );
         }
         add_action( 'load-toplevel_page_usces_orderlist', 'usces_admin_order_list_hook' );
         add_filter( 'screen_settings', 'usces_orderlist_screen_settings', 10, 2 );
         add_filter( 'usces_admin_order_list', array( $this, 'change_orderlist' ) );
      }
      if ( self::$opts['memberlist_flag'] ) {
         if ( isset( $_REQUEST['member_action'] ) && 'dlmembernewlist' == $_REQUEST['member_action'] ) {
            add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'download_member_list' ) );
         }
         add_action( 'load-welcart-management_page_usces_memberlist', 'usces_admin_member_list_hook' );
         add_filter( 'screen_settings', 'usces_memberlist_screen_settings', 10, 2 );
         add_filter( 'usces_admin_member_list', array( $this, 'change_memberlist' ) );
      }
   }
}

```

In the `__construct` method, the plugin registers the three actions (`download_order_list`, `download_orderdetail_list` and `download_member_list`) with the `admin_init` hook if the `is_admin` function returns true. As we’ve seen many times on this blog, neither `admin_init` nor `is_admin` can guarantee that the user is a logged-in administrator, they can be bypassed by an unauthenticated user accessing the “wp-admin/admin-ajax.php” or “wp-admin/admin-post.php” scripts for instance.

All three actions lack a capability check. An unauthenticated user can download the list of members, products and orders in CSV format.

### Authenticated System Information Disclosure

CVSS v3.1: [4.3 (medium)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

In “usc-e-shop/includes/default\_filters.php” script, the plugin registers the `usces_download_system_information` AJAX action.

```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_usces_download_system_information', 'usces_download_system_information' );

```

The `usces_download_system_information` function is located in the “usc-e-shop/functions/function.php” script:

```
function usces_download_system_information(){
   $filename = 'welcart_information_' . date_i18n('YmdHis') .  '.txt';
   $wp_environment = usces_get_wp_environment();
   $environment = $wp_environment['environment'];
   $theme = $wp_environment['theme'];
   $active_plugins = $wp_environment['active_plugins'];
   $inactive_plugins = $wp_environment['inactive_plugins'];
   $welcart_information = get_welcart_system_information();
   $loaded_extensions = get_loaded_extensions();
   $ini_confs = ini_get_all();
   $data = generate_system_information_text( $environment, $theme, $active_plugins, $inactive_plugins, $welcart_information, $loaded_extensions, $ini_confs);
   $result = array(
      'status' => true,
      'data' => $data,
      'filename' => $filename
   );
   echo json_encode($result);
   wp_die();
}

```

It lacks a capability check too.

Any logged-in users can export the JSON-encoded data, which includes: WordPress settings, theme and plugins (active/inactive) with their version, Welcart general settings and payment method etc, as well as the server and PHP settings.

### Recommendations
