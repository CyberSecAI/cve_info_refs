Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `usces_download_system_information()` function within the Welcart e-Commerce plugin. This function is intended to provide system information for administrators, but due to the missing check, it can be accessed by any authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization/Capability Check:** The core issue is the lack of a proper authorization check before executing the `usces_download_system_information()` function. This allows any logged-in user to trigger the function.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerable function outputs sensitive data, including WordPress settings, plugin settings (active/inactive), PHP settings, and server settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive configuration details of the WordPress site, the Welcart plugin, and the server environment.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The leaked information can be used to identify vulnerabilities in other plugins or services used by the site, facilitating more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely.
*   **Specific URL:** The function is triggered through an AJAX request to `wp_ajax_usces_download_system_information`.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the WordPress site, even with basic privileges

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with any role, as no specific admin or higher privilege is required.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target site.
*  No other special privileges or system access is required.
