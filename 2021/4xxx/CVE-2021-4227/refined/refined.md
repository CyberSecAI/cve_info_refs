- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or encode comments when using the Source editor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Iframe injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization/encoding of user-supplied content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject arbitrary content, like an iframe, into the comments section, allowing them to load content from external sources. This could potentially be used for phishing, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by using the "Source" editor of the comment box and injecting an iframe tag with a malicious "src" attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to post a comment, and potentially be able to get that comment approved, to exploit this vulnerability. Depending on the website configurations, it may or may not require authentication to leave a comment, and may require the comment to be approved by a moderator.
