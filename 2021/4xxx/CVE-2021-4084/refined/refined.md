{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application was not properly encoding user-supplied input values when displaying them in the admin UI, specifically within the DataObject Class settings. This allowed for the injection of HTML and potentially JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of HTML encoding/escaping of user-provided input in several text fields.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that would be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the affected admin UI pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the affected text fields of the DataObject Class settings through the application's user interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to access and modify DataObject Class settings. The attacker would be able to modify the affected fields, injecting malicious code."
