The provided content relates to a fix for a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in phpRedisAdmin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application was vulnerable to CSRF attacks because it did not implement any mechanism to verify the authenticity of requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application lacked CSRF protection. An attacker could potentially trick a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions on the application by crafting a malicious link or form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge or consent. This could include modifying, deleting or exporting data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector would involve tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a form that targets the vulnerable application. This could be done via phishing emails, malicious websites, or other methods of social engineering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a user who is logged into phpRedisAdmin into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link that makes a request to phpRedisAdmin. The attacker does not need to be logged into the phpRedisAdmin application.

**Fix:**
The provided content shows a commit that adds CSRF protection to the application. The fix implements the following:
- A CSRF token is generated and stored in the session.
- This token is added as a hidden field in forms that modify data (edit, export, import, rename, ttl).
- The token is validated on the server side for POST requests. If the token is missing or invalid the request will be rejected and a “bad csrf token” error will occur.
- This change also includes an important comment mentioning that function `random_bytes` is missing in PHP 5.6, which breaks package.
