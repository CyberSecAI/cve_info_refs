## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Controlled Admin Access < 1.5.6 - Improper Access Control to Privilege Escalation

### Description

The plugin did not properly restrict access when checking user with limited access, allowing them to query pages they should not be able to, which could lead to privilege escalation by creating a new administrator with full, unrestricted access to the blog.

### Proof of Concept

Created a temporary admin account via the plugin (/wp-admin/users.php?page=controlled\_admin\_access), with limited access, logon with it and open the below URLs which should not be accessible
- https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=%2Fcontrolled\_admin\_access

# Vulnerabilities fixed in WordPress Controlled Admin Access plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [March 30, 2021 - 12:02am [+0700]March 30, 2021 - 12:04am [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/vulnerabilities-fixed-in-wordpress-controlled-admin-access-plugin/)

Improper input validation in the WordPress [Controlled Admin Access](https://wordpress.org/plugins/controlled-admin-access/) plugin (8,000+ active installations) affecting version 1.5.5 and below could lead to privilege escalation.

### Improper Input Validation

Controlled Admin Access is a plugin used to give a temporary and limited admin access to the WordPress dashboard. It doesn’t remove capabilities but instead relies on a user-defined blacklist of URI or various parameters, all user input, to restrict access to certain pages or sub-menus. By default, access to the plugin configuration pages, e.g., `wp-admin/users.php?page=controlled_admin_access`, is restricted too:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/wordpress-controlled-admin-access-vulnerability-2.png)

In the “controlled-admin-access/admin/class-controlled-admin-access-admin.php” script, the plugin compares the value of the `$_GET['page']` input to the list of restricted pages stored in the `$not_allowed_pages` array:

```
if (isset($_GET['page'])) {
   if(in_array($_GET['page'], $not_allowed_pages)){
      wp_die(__('You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page.'),'controlled-admin-access');
      exit;
   }
}

```

Sub-menus are loaded by calling the WordPress `add_submenu_page` function:

```
public function register_my_custom_submenu_pages(){

   add_submenu_page('users.php',
      __('Controlled Admin Access', 'controlled-admin-access'),
      __('Controlled Admin Access', 'controlled-admin-access'),
      'edit_users',
      'controlled_admin_access',
      array($this, 'controlled_admin_access_page') );
   ...

```

The fifth parameter of the function, `controlled_admin_access`, is the value assigned to the `$_GET['page']` input and is called the `menu_slug`.

The `add_submenu_page` function is found in the [wp-admin/includes/plugin.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_submenu_page/#source) script:

```
function add_submenu_page( $parent_slug, $page_title, $menu_title, $capability, $menu_slug, $function = '', $position = null ) {
   global $submenu, $menu, $_wp_real_parent_file, $_wp_submenu_nopriv,
      $_registered_pages, $_parent_pages;

   $menu_slug   = plugin_basename( $menu_slug );
   ...
   ...

```

We can see that it immediately calls the `plugin_basename` function with the `$menu_slug` as a parameter. The function is found in the [wp-includes/plugin.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/plugin_basename/#source):

```
function plugin_basename( $file ) {
   global $wp_plugin_paths;

   // $wp_plugin_paths contains normalized paths.
   $file = wp_normalize_path( $file );

   arsort( $wp_plugin_paths );
   foreach ( $wp_plugin_paths as $dir => $realdir ) {
      if ( strpos( $file, $realdir ) === 0 ) {
         $file = $dir . substr( $file, strlen( $realdir ) );
      }
   }

   $plugin_dir    = wp_normalize_path( WP_PLUGIN_DIR );
   $mu_plugin_dir = wp_normalize_path( WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR );

   // Get relative path from plugins directory.
   $file = preg_replace( '#^' . preg_quote( $plugin_dir, '#' ) . '/|^' . preg_quote( $mu_plugin_dir, '#' ) . '/#', '', $file );
   $file = trim( $file, '/' );
   return $file;
}

```

Interestingly, the function can potentially transform the menu\_slug lines 690, 695, 703 and 704.

Therefore, if we can access any sub-menu page in the WordPress dashboard by using the `?page=menu_slug` format, we can also access it by inserting one or more leading or trailing slashes such as `?page=/menu_slug` or `?page=///////menu_slug/////////`, or even prepend the full path to the plugins folder such as `?page=/home/foo/html/wp-content/plugins/menu_slug`. WordPress will clean up the mess and will load the requested sub-menu anyway.

Using such trick, a user with restricted access to the dashboard can access the Controlled Admin Access configuration page:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/wordpress-controlled-admin-access-vulnerability.png)

The user can submit the above form and create a new administrator with full, unrestricted access to the blog.

### Additional Issues

The plugin restricts access to some pages based on the query string without decoding it. A user can access those pages simply by encoding one or more characters in the query string (`%xx`).

### Recommendations

Update immediately if you have version 1.5.5 or below installed.

Note that if you are using our NinjaFirewall plugin, you can restrict its access to specific admin users without the need of a third-party plugin (see [Restricting access to NinjaFirewall (WP Edition) settings](https://blog.nintechnet.com/restricting-access-to-ninjafirewall-wp-edition-settings/)).

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the authors on March 26. A new version 1.5.6 was released on March 28.

## Features
### Menu Filter
The plugin will allow you to select admin menu items that you want to restrict for the created admin. Not only the plugin will hide the menu item from the admin but it also will block the page if they access it in some other way.
### Expiration Time
You may donât want to give access indefinitely, the plugin allows you to set an expiration time for the restricted admin account. After the account expires, the account will no longer be able to login into the admin dashboard. Moreover, you can always extend the expiry time or change it.
### Hide Admin Bar
WordPress offers an admin bar to provide quick access to some pages or to perform some actions. Using the plugin, you can hide the admin bar links at the top of the page will be hidden in both the frontend and admin areas.
### Disable Access
You can always disable the restricted admin account at any time. For example, if you gave a developer access to fix a bug or install a theme, when they finish the task you can disable their account. This will block login in using the account but it will retain the accountâs information in case you wanted to give them access in the future.
## Pro Features
### Plugins Internal Pages
Take more control and restrict access to pluginsâ internal pages. For example, you would like to give access to the WooCommerce Settings page, but you do not want the account to see the Payments Gateways tab. Currently, the plugin supports WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads and BuddyPress. In the future, we will add support for more plugins.
### No Password Login
Add some convenience when sending access to the user, you can generate a secure login URL for the user, and the user will use the link to login into the dashboard without the need for a password. You can also disable login by a password for restricted admins, this will restrict the admin from login in using a password or sending a reset password email.
### Activity Log
Keep track of what restricted admins have done while logged in, the plugin will log more than 20 actions such as activating/deactivating/deleting a plugin, switching a theme, deleting a theme, exporting data, publishing/deleting a post and uploading a file.
### Remote Logout
At any given time, you can force logging out any restricted admin if you no longer need them logged in the admin dashboard. This action will log them out on all logged-in devices and locations.
