Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the "Controlled Admin Access" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin failed to adequately restrict access to its configuration page based on user roles and permissions. It relied on a blacklist of URIs or parameters which could be bypassed by manipulating the `$_GET['page']` input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The plugin did not properly validate user permissions before allowing access to sensitive configuration pages.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The plugin's access restriction mechanism could be bypassed by adding leading or trailing slashes to the `$_GET['page']` parameter or prepending the full path to the plugins folder. Additionally, URL encoding bypasses were possible.
*   **Reliance on User-Defined Blacklist:**  The plugin used a user-defined blacklist for restricted pages, which proved insufficient and allowed for bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with limited access could gain full administrator privileges by accessing the plugin's configuration page.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Users with limited privileges could access restricted parts of the WordPress dashboard.
*   **Creation of rogue admin accounts:** By accessing the plugin's configuration, a malicious user could create a new administrator account with full unrestricted access, leading to complete compromise of the blog.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves manipulating the `$_GET['page']` parameter in the URL when accessing the WordPress admin dashboard. Attackers can use the following methods:

*   Adding leading or trailing slashes to the page parameter (`?page=/controlled_admin_access` or `?page=///////controlled_admin_access/////////`).
*   Prepending the full path to the plugins folder in the page parameter (`?page=/home/foo/html/wp-content/plugins/controlled_admin_access`).
*   URL encoding characters in the query string (`%xx`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need:

*   **A limited access account:** The attacker needs a user account with restricted access to the WordPress dashboard, which was created via the plugin.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability to manipulate the URL appropriately.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable versions are below 1.5.6 of the Controlled Admin Access WordPress Plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.5.6.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Jerome Bruandet of NinTechNet.
*   The CVSS score is 9.9 (Critical) according to wordfence.com and 8.8 (high) according to wpscan.com
*   The vulnerability is categorized under "Improper Access Control"

**In Summary:**
The CVE-2021-4360 vulnerability in the Controlled Admin Access plugin arises from inadequate access controls and improper input validation. This allows a user with limited access to bypass restrictions, potentially leading to privilege escalation and the creation of new administrator accounts, thus a complete takeover of the affected WordPress site.
