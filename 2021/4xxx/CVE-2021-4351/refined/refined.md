Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-4351, as described in the provided blog post and Wordfence article:

**Root Cause:**

The primary root cause is the lack of proper authorization checks, capability checks, and sanitization within the Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress. This is particularly evident in AJAX actions that handle post meta data modifications, settings changes, and file operations. The plugin relies on insecure functions such as `wpfm_get_current_user` and fails to use security nonces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Privilege Escalation:**
    *   The `wpfm_get_current_user` function allows overriding the current user ID via the `$_GET['file_owner']` parameter, leading to privilege escalation.
2.  **Unauthenticated Content Injection and Stored XSS:**
    *   The `wpfm_edit_file_title_desc` AJAX action allows unauthenticated users to edit any post title and content.
    *   The lack of proper sanitization in `wpfm_edit_file_title_desc` enables stored XSS by injecting JavaScript code in the post title, which executes when an admin visits the plugin settings.
3.  **Authenticated Settings Change and Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   The `wpfm_save_settings` AJAX action lacks capability checks and security nonce, allowing any authenticated user to modify plugin settings, including allowed file types.
    *   Combined with the ability to alter allowed file types, attackers can upload malicious PHP files leading to remote code execution.
4.  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion:**
    *   The `wpfm_delete_file` AJAX action lacks authorization and security nonce, allowing unauthenticated users to delete any post.
5.  **Unauthenticated Post Meta Change and Arbitrary File Download:**
    *   The `wpfm_file_meta_update` AJAX action lacks authorization, nonce, and sanitization, allowing unauthenticated users to change post meta data, potentially leading to arbitrary file download.
6.  **Unauthenticated HTML Injection:**
    *   The `wpfm_send_file_in_email` AJAX action lacks proper sanitization, allowing unauthenticated users to inject HTML in emails, enabling the blog to be used as a spam relay.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access and control over the WordPress site.
*   **Content Injection/Defacement:** Attackers can modify or inject malicious content into pages and posts on the blog.
*   **Stored XSS:** Attackers can execute JavaScript code in the admin backend, potentially leading to account compromise and further malicious actions.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading PHP scripts, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Data Loss:** Attackers can delete posts and pages from the website.
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** Attackers can download sensitive files like `wp-config.php`.
*   **Spam Relay:** Attackers can use the website to send spam emails.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST Requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered through AJAX requests with manipulated parameters, such as `file_owner`, `file_id`, `file_title`, `file_content`, meta data fields, and settings.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Most vulnerabilities are accessible to unauthenticated users due to the lack of proper access controls and security measures.
*   **File Upload:** The arbitrary file upload vulnerability is triggered through the plugins file upload functionality when file types are not properly restricted.
*   **Email Functionality:** The email injection vector is exploited via the plugins email sharing feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the WordPress site to send HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Most attacks can be performed without any prior authentication. For arbitrary file upload and settings changes, an authenticated user is required.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** Attackers need to know the vulnerable AJAX actions and parameters to exploit these issues.

The information provided in the content aligns with the vulnerability description, and provides additional context regarding specific function calls, lack of nonce usage and other weaknesses.
