# WordPress Frontend File Manager plugin fixed multiple critical vulnerabilities.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [July 12, 2021 - 12:07pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-frontend-file-manager-plugin-fixed-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities/)

The WordPress [Frontend File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nmedia-user-file-uploader/) plugin (2,000+ active installations) fixed multiple critical vulnerabilities affecting version 17.1 and, to some extend, version 18.2 (see [Timeline](#timeline) below for more details).

---

### Privilege Escalation

Throughout its code, the plugin relies on the `wpfm_get_current_user` function from the “nmedia-user-file-uploader/inc/helpers.php” script to get the user ID:

```
// This function will return a current user object
// if logged in then current otherwise will see public user settings
function wpfm_get_current_user() {

    $current_user_id = null;
    if( is_user_logged_in() ) {

        $current_user_id = get_current_user_id();
    } elseif ( wpfm_is_guest_upload_allow() ) {

        $current_user_id = get_option('wpfm_guest_user_id');
    }

    if( isset($_GET['file_owner']) && $_GET['file_owner'] != '' ) {
        $current_user_id = $_GET['file_owner'];
    }

    $current_user   = get_userdata( $current_user_id );

    return apply_filters('wpfm_get_current_user', $current_user);
}

```

It retrieves the user ID from the WordPress `get_current_user_id` function if the user is authenticated, or from the plugin’s `wpfm_guest_user_id` option if the user is not logged-in. However, the user, authenticated or not, can assign any ID to the `$_GET['file_owner']` variable in order to override `$current_user_id` L318, which could lead to privilege escalation.

---

### Unauthenticated Content Injection and Stored XSS

The `wpfm_edit_file_title_desc` AJAX action (unauthenticated) loads the `wpfm_edit_file_title_desc` function from the “nmedia-user-file-uploader/inc/callback-functions.php” script. It is used to edit a post:

```
/*
 * Edit file title and description
 */
function wpfm_edit_file_title_desc(){

   if (isset($_REQUEST)) {
      $file = array(
         'ID'           => esc_attr($_REQUEST['file_id']),
         'post_title'   => esc_attr($_REQUEST['file_title']),
         'post_content' => esc_attr($_REQUEST['file_content']),
      );
      $post_id = wp_update_post( $file, true );
      // var_dump($post_id);
      // Update the post into the database
      if( $post_id != 0 ) {

         update_post_meta( $post_id,'wpfm_title', $_REQUEST['file_title']);
         _e('File updated', 'wpfm');
      }
      else
         _e('Error while updating file, try again', 'wpfm');
   }

   die(0);
}

```

It doesn’t check if users are editing their own post and lacks a security nonce.

An unauthenticated user can change the content and title of every page and post on the blog:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nmedia-user-file-uploader_vulnerability.png)

In addition, if the post type is `wpfm-files`, it is possible to inject JavaScript code in the post title because the plugin relies only on the WordPress [esc\_attr](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_attr/) function to sanitise the `$_REQUEST['file_title']` variable, which will be echoed outside HTML attributes in the backend section. The JS code will be executed when an admin user visits the plugin’s settings pages:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nmedia-user-file-uploader_vulnerability-1.png)

An unauthenticated user could inject JavaScript code in order [to create an admin user account](https://blog.nintechnet.com/how-hackers-exploit-xss-vulnerabilities-to-create-admin-accounts-on-your-wordpress-blog/).

---

### Authenticated Settings Change and Arbitrary File Upload

The `wpfm_save_settings` function from the “nmedia-user-file-uploader/inc/admin.php” script is loaded by the `wpfm_save_settings` AJAX action (authenticated). It is used to save the plugin’s settings:

```
  9 function wpfm_save_settings() {
 10
 11    $wpfm_settigns = array(
 12       "wpfm_files_view"         => isset($_REQUEST['wpfm_files_view'] ) && $_REQUEST['wpfm_files_view'] != '' ? $_REQUEST['wpfm_files_view']  : 'grid',
 13       "wpfm_thumb_size"         => isset($_REQUEST['wpfm_thumb_size']) ? sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['wpfm_thumb_size']) : '',
 14       "wpfm_button_title"       => isset($_REQUEST['wpfm_button_title']) ? sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['wpfm_button_title']) : '',
 15       "wpfm_upload_title"       => isset($_REQUEST['wpfm_upload_title']) ? sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['wpfm_upload_title']) : '',
      ...
      ...
 21       "wpfm_file_types"         => isset($_REQUEST['wpfm_file_types']) ? sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['wpfm_file_types']) : '',
      ...
      ...
 94       //table view
 95       "wpfm_enable_table"       => isset($_REQUEST['wpfm_enable_table']) ? sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['wpfm_enable_table']) : '',
 96    );
 97    update_option ( WPFM_SHORT_NAME . '_settings', $wpfm_settigns );
 98    _e( 'All options are updated', 'wpfm' );
 99    die ( 0 );
100 }

```

There’s no capability check or security nonce.

An authenticated user can modify the plugin’s settings, for instance by adding `php` to the list of allowed filetypes:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nmedia-user-file-uploader_vulnerability-2.png)

Using the `wpfm_upload_file` AJAX action, the attacker could then upload a PHP script that would be saved and accessible as `http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/user_uploads/<username>/<file>.php`, which would lead to remote code execution:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nmedia-user-file-uploader_vulnerability-3.png)

---

### Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion

The `wpfm_delete_file` AJAX action (unauthenticated) loads the `wpfm_delete_file` function from the “nmedia-user-file-uploader/inc/files.php” script. It takes an ID, `$_REQUEST['file_id']`, and deletes the corresponding post L708:

```
function wpfm_delete_file() {

   //check if it has attachment
   $file_id = intval($_REQUEST['file_id']);
   $curent_user = wpfm_get_current_user();

   $file = new WPFM_File($file_id);

   $response = array();
     if( $file->delete_file() ){

      $message = sprintf(__('%s Successfully Removed', 'wpfm'), $file->title);
      update_user_meta( get_current_user_id(), 'wpfm_total_filesize_used', wpfm_get_user_files_size(get_current_user_id()) );

      // Now deleting post
        wp_delete_post($file_id, true);

```

The plugin doesn’t verify that the user is allowed to delete the corresponding post and it lacks a security nonce. There’s only a call to the unsafe `wpfm_get_current_user` function but the result, `$curent_user`, is not even checked in the code.

An unauthenticated user can delete every page and post on the blog.

---

### Unauthenticated Post Meta Change and Arbitrary File Download

The `wpfm_file_meta_update` AJAX action (unauthenticated) loads the `wpfm_file_meta_update` function from the “nmedia-user-file-uploader/inc/files.php” script. It is used to modify post meta data:

```
function wpfm_file_meta_update() {

   $file_id = isset($_REQUEST['file_id']) ? $_REQUEST['file_id'] : '' ;
   // we have meta fiels array with action and field_id
   // we remove file_id and action key form meta array
   unset($_REQUEST['action']);
   unset($_REQUEST['file_id']);

   // now we have pure meta fields array
   $meta_fields = $_REQUEST;

   if ($file_id != '') {

      foreach ($meta_fields as $meta_key => $meta_value) {

         update_post_meta( $file_id, $meta_key, $meta_value );
      }

      _e("File Meta save successfully", "wpfm");
   }else{
         _e("File Meta not save successfully", "wpfm");
   }

```

There’s no capability check or nonce, and the data is not validated or sanitised.

Users can change any post meta data, which could lead for instance to arbitrary file download among other issues: after uploading a file, a user can change its post meta data by assigning `wpfm_dir_path` to `$meta_key` and `wp-config.php` to `$meta_value` and then download the wp-config.php script instead of the uploaded file.

---

### Unauthenticated HTML Injection

The `wpfm_send_file_in_email` AJAX action (unauthenticated) loads the `wpfm_send_file_in_email` function from the “nmedia-user-file-uploader/inc/callback-functions.php” script. It allows a user to send an email to a recipient in order to share the link to the file uploaded by that user:

```
// sending file in email
function wpfm_send_file_in_email() {

   $file_id = isset($_REQUEST['file_id']) ? $_REQUEST['file_id'] : '';

   $file = new WPFM_File($file_id);

   if( empty($_POST['subject']) || empty($_POST['emailaddress']) ) {

      $response = array('message'=>__('Email or Subject not given.','wpfm'),'status'=>'error');
      wp_send_json( $response );
   }

   $message       = '';
   $message      .= $_POST['message'];
   $message      .= '<br><hr>';

    $file_hash = $file->add_file_hash();

    $download_url   = add_query_arg('file_hash',$file_hash, $file->download_url);

   $message      .= sprintf(__('<a href="%s">Download %s</a>','wpfm'), esc_url($download_url), $file->title );

   $context = 'send-file';
   $email = new WPFM_Email($file_id, $context);
   $email->to      = $_POST['emailaddress'];
   $email->subject = $_POST['subject'];
   $email->message = $message;

   // send
   $email->send();

   $response = array('message'=>__('File is shared successfully','wpfm'),'status'=>'success');

```

The user can customise the email subject, the recipient’s email address and also the message body. Because it is sent in HTML format and it isn’t sanitized, it is possible to inject HTML code (text formatting, CSS, images etc) in order to fully customise the email. Additionally, even if `$_REQUEST['file_id']` is empty or invalid, the message will be sent anyway.

An unauthenticated user can use the blog as a spam relay.

### Description

The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Post Meta Change in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking authentication protections, capability checks, and sanitization, all on the wpfm\_file\_meta\_update AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the meta data of certain posts and pages.
