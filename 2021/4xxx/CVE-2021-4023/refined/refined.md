{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of IO-uring request cancellation when worker creation fails due to a shortage of free space",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The kernel can panic when an improper cancellation operation triggers the submission of new io-uring operations during a shortage of free space. Specifically, when `io_wqe_enqueue()` -> `io_wqe_create_worker()` fails, `io_run_cancel()` is called to clean up the request, however the request is already enqueued and might be executed during the cancellation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local user with permissions to execute io-uring requests can cause a system crash (kernel panic).",
  "Attack vectors": "Local user execution of io-uring requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with permissions to execute io-uring requests."
