Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The commit message "Hotfix: XSS-Vulnerability $\_SERVER['PHP\_SELF']" indicates that the vulnerability is related to the usage of the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable in the PHP code.
- The code change replaces `$filename = $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];` with `$filename = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'];`.
- `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` is vulnerable to XSS because it can be manipulated by attackers by injecting malicious code into the URL path. This is because `PHP_SELF` contains the current script's file path, which can include user-supplied data when used in URLs like example.com/index.php/<script>alert('xss')</script>.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the insecure use of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`. The original code likely used the `$filename` variable (obtained from `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`) in a context where it was directly rendered into the HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding.
- `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` contains the filename of the current script. This value is susceptible to manipulation by users via URL path manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page, which will then be executed by the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.
- The injected JavaScript can perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting to malicious websites
    - Defacing the web page
    - Performing actions on the user's behalf
- The severity depends on the specific impact of the injected JavaScript code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the URL path. For example: `http://example.com/vulnerable.php/<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
- The attacker would then trick a user into visiting this malicious URL.
- The server would use the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` value in the page without sanitizing/encoding it, thus executing the attacker's payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to induce the victim to visit that URL.
- The attacker does not require access to the server's filesystem.
- The attacker needs an application that uses `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` in an unsafe way and renders it to the web page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix uses `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` instead. `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` contains only the filename of the current script, and is not user-controllable through the URL path, making it safer.
- The provided link to `<https://seancoates.com/blogs/xss-woes>` seems to confirm this explanation of the vulnerability.

In summary, the vulnerability is a classic XSS issue due to the use of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`, which was corrected by switching to `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']`.
