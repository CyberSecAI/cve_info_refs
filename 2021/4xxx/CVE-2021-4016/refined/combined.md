[Insight Agent Release Notes /](/release-notes/insightagent/) Jan 19, 2022

Jan 19, 20223.1.3
## New

* We updated the Insight Agent data collection on Windows to support Patch Tuesday vulnerability checks for December 2021 and January 2022.
* We updated the Insight Agent data collection to support new fingerprinting for Microsoft Edge Chromium.

## Improved

* We upgraded the Insight Agent codebase to use Python 3.9.5 and OpenSSL 1.1.1L to remediate vulnerabilities found in older libraries.

## Fixed

* The Insight Agent now supports 5 digit proxy port numbers during installation.

## Security Update

* We fixed CVE-2021-4016, an improper access control vulnerability affecting the Insight Agent. This issue could have allowed non-system users to access the Insight Agent snapshot directory. Special thanks to Andreas Welcker for discovering and reporting this vulnerability to Rapid7.
