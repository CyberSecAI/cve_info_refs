Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-4155 from the provided content:

**1. CVE Description (from security-tracker.debian.org, duckduckgo.com, www.cve.org, www.suse.com, linux.oracle.com):**

*   **Vulnerability:** A data leak flaw exists in the XFS filesystem's `XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP` IOCTL (Input/Output Control) implementation.
*   **Root Cause:** The flaw occurs when the `XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP` IOCTL is used to increase the size of files with unaligned sizes, leading to a failure in clearing data in unwritten blocks at the end of the files.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access is required.
*   **Impact:** A local attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially leak data from the XFS filesystem that would not normally be accessible to them.

**2. Technical Details and Weaknesses (from git.kernel.org, security-tracker.debian.org, www.suse.com):**

*   The vulnerability specifically involves the `xfs_ioc_space` function within the XFS filesystem code.
*   The core issue is that when pre-allocating space using `XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP` with unaligned sizes, the `xfs_vn_setattr_size()` function fails to zero out the unwritten blocks at the end of the file. This results in the exposure of the raw block device data.
*   The fix, as outlined in the provided patch, addresses this problem by mapping unwritten blocks to be zeroed when using `XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP`, similar to the behavior of the `fallocate` and `RESVSP` ioctls.  The change consists of a single line addition that sets the `XFS_BMAPI_PREALLOC` flag when calling `xfs_alloc_file_space`.

**3. Impact of Exploitation (from security-tracker.debian.org, duckduckgo.com, www.suse.com):**

*   A local attacker can use the flaw to leak potentially sensitive data residing on the XFS filesystem that they would otherwise not be able to access.
*   The impact is primarily related to data confidentiality compromise, rather than integrity or availability.

**4. Attacker Capabilities and Position (from security-tracker.debian.org, www.suse.com):**

*   The attacker must be local.
*   The attacker must have low privileges to initiate the vulnerable IOCTL call.
*   No user interaction is required.

**5. Affected Systems (from security-tracker.debian.org, www.suse.com, duckduckgo.com):**

*   Linux kernels with XFS filesystem support are vulnerable
*   Various Linux distributions are affected, including Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, and SUSE.

**6. Fix Information (from security-tracker.debian.org, www.suse.com, git.kernel.org):**

*   The official fix is available in the Linux kernel commit [983d8e60f50806f90534cc5373d0ce867e5aaf79](https://git.kernel.org/linus/983d8e60f50806f90534cc5373d0ce867e5aaf79).
*   Various Linux distributions have backported this patch to their respective kernels.
*   The fix consists of setting the `XFS_BMAPI_PREALLOC` flag to `xfs_alloc_file_space` when the condition `bf->l_start > XFS_ISIZE(ip)` is true.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as affecting the XFS filesystem specifically and the related IOCTL.
*   Several sources mention that the issue is related to how `XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP` handles unaligned file sizes
*   Some content from the search results is not directly relevant to CVE-2021-4155, such as the search results on github.com, Suse's social impact page, and the merchandise store.
*   The github search results show many issues that have CVE-2021-44228, or other CVEs that are not related to the one in question.
*   The github search result for the vulnerability in argoproj/argo-cd is related to CVE-2025-21613 and CVE-2024-45337 and therefore UNRELATED.
*   Some github results are bots detecting other CVEs in various dependency files, and are not related to this CVE.

**Summary of findings:**

This vulnerability in the XFS filesystem allows a local attacker to potentially leak data due to a flaw when pre-allocating space for files with unaligned sizes. The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the upstream fix or through updated kernel packages provided by different operating system vendors. This vulnerability is considered "moderate" severity by SUSE and Ubuntu, as its impact is on data confidentiality, and requires low-privileged access.
