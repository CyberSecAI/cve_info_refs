Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content appears to be a commit diff from the `snipe-it` repository on GitHub, specifically focusing on a change in `AssetModelsController.php`. The commit introduces an authorization check (`$this->authorize('create', AssetModel::class);`) in the `getClone` function. While this commit itself may seem like a security fix,  **there is no mention of CVE-2021-4089 in the provided content.** There is no description or any indication of vulnerability.

**2. Detailed Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause of Change:** The change is related to adding an authorization check for creating a new Asset Model instance.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present (Before the Change):** Based on this commit diff alone, we can infer that before this change, a user with the ability to view asset models was not explicitly checked for create permissions to perform the cloning operation. This implies that the lack of authorization check on `create` permission prior to the code change allows users with only `view` permission to access the functionality.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Without this authorization check, an attacker might have been able to perform an asset model clone operation even if the user has only view permissions, potentially leading to unauthorized data manipulation. Although, this could be a non issue depending on the behavior of the `clone` operation being used.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector would be an authenticated user with `view` permission trying to access the clone feature.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would need to have a valid user account with at least view permissions to Asset Model functionality.

**Conclusion:**

Although the content provides information about a code change related to permission checks on the asset model clone function, it **does not mention anything related to CVE-2021-4089**. Therefore, we can not verify any relation between the content and the specified CVE.

**Response: NOINFO**
