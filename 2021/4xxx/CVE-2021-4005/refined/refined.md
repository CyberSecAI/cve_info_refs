The provided content is a mix of a GitHub commit page and a generic Huntr.dev page. Neither of these appears to relate to a specific CVE, especially CVE-2021-4005 as it is a placeholder CVE ID with no assigned description yet.

The GitHub commit diff shows a minor fix in a Twig template related to two-factor authentication settings. The commit includes changes to display text related to backup codes and disable 2FA. It modifies the HTML structure of a form related to disabling two-factor authentication.

The Huntr.dev content is a standard webpage footer, providing links to general information about the platform. It does not provide any information regarding vulnerabilities or security issues.

Therefore, based on the provided content, I cannot extract any vulnerability information related to the specified CVE ID.

RESPONSE: NOINFO
