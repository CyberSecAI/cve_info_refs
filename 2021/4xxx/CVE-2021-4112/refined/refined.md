Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a bypass of a previous fix for CVE-2021-20253 related to job isolation in Ansible Tower. Specifically, the flaw allows an attacker to escape the isolated environment where Ansible jobs are executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Job Isolation Escape:** The primary weakness is the failure of the job isolation mechanism to properly restrict user privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can leverage the flaw to gain the privileges of the `awx` user, which has elevated permissions within Ansible Tower.
- **Exploitation via Email:** The attacker exploits Postfix to create a directory owned by the `awx` user. Then, the attacker places a binary in this directory, that the low privilege user can use to gain `awx` user privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation leads to a low-privileged user gaining the ability to execute commands with the privileges of the `awx` user. This can allow complete control over the Ansible Tower instance.
- **Potential System Compromise:** With elevated access, an attacker could potentially compromise the underlying system, access sensitive information, or disrupt operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** The initial vector involves sending a crafted email to the `awx` user.
- **File Creation:** The email is used to leverage Postfix to create a folder owned by `awx`.
- **Binary Injection:** A malicious binary is placed in the created folder.
- **Execution:** The malicious binary is executed by a low privilege user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privileged User:** An attacker needs a low-privileged user account within the Ansible Tower environment.
- **Ability to Send Email:** The attacker must be able to send an email that will be processed by the systemâ€™s mail service (Postfix).
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to have enough access to the filesystem, to interact with the malicious binary created.
- **Knowledge of Exploit:** The attacker needs specific knowledge of the exploit chain to gain elevated privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is a bypass of a previous fix for CVE-2021-20253.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.1, 2.0, and Red Hat Ansible Tower 3.8 with errata RHSA-2022:0460, RHSA-2022:0474, and RHSA-2022:0482 respectively.
- The fix involved updating `ansible-tower` and `ansible-runner` packages.
