The commit fixes security vulnerabilities caused by the `PyYAML` dependency. It also updates the `PyYAML` dependency in the `requirements.txt` from version `5.1` to `5.4`.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information found:

**Vulnerabilities Addressed:**
- CVE-2020-1747
- CVE-2020-14343

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerabilities stem from the usage of the `PyYAML` library. Specifically, `yaml.load()` is used with an unsafe loader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use of `yaml.load()` with `yaml.UnsafeLoader`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The usage of an unsafe YAML loader can lead to arbitrary code execution if the YAML file contains malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
A malicious actor could craft a specially crafted YAML file which when loaded, could execute arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to control the YAML file used by the application.

**Changes Made in the Commit:**
- The commit updates `requirements.txt` file to use `PyYAML>=5.4`
- The commit updates the use of  `yaml.load(fp, Loader=yaml.UnsafeLoader)` to `yaml.full_load(fp)` in `pytorch_lightning/core/saving.py`
