# Multiple vulnerabilities in WordPress WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin (unpatched).

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [January 12, 2021 - 12:07pm [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:22pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress-wp-quick-frontend-editor-plugin-unpatched/)

The WordPress [WP Quick FrontEnd Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-quick-front-end-editor/) plugin (1,000+ active installations) is prone to a broken access control vulnerability affecting version 5.5 and below that could lead to authenticated content injection, stored XSS and settings change among other issues.

> This plugin does not seem to be maintained anymore and the vulnerability has never been fixed. Make sure to follow the recommendations below.

### Authenticated Content Injection

In the “plugin.class.php” script L15, the plugin registers the AJAX `save_content_front` action with the WordPress `wp_ajax_*` hook:

```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_save_content_front', array($this, 'save_content_front') );

```

The `save_content_front` function, L269, calls the WordPress `wp_update_post` function but doesn’t check if the user is allowed to create or modify the corresponding post or page:

```
function save_content_front(){

   extract($_REQUEST);
   print_r($_REQUEST);

   $thumb_id = get_post_thumbnail_id( $id );
   if ( isset($imagesrc) && $imagesrc != '' ) {
      set_post_thumbnail( $id, $imageid );
   } else{
      delete_post_thumbnail( $id );
   };

      $my_post = array(
      'ID'           => $id,
      'post_title'   => $title,
      'post_content' => $content,
   );

   wp_update_post( $my_post );
   die(0);
}

```

An authenticated user can edit/create any page or post on the blog.

Additionally, because the function lacks a security nonce, the call to the `print_r()` function L272 is prone to a reflected XSS via a CSRF attack.

### Authenticated Settings Change and Stored XSS

In the same “plugin.class.php” script L17, the plugin registers the AJAX `la_save_front_editor` action with the `wp_ajax_*` hook:

```
add_action('wp_ajax_la_save_front_editor', array($this, 'save_admin_options'));

```

The `save_admin_options` is found L33 and is used to save the plugin’s options:

```
function save_admin_options(){
   if (isset($_REQUEST)) {
      update_option( 'la_front_editor', $_REQUEST );
   }
   die(0);
}

```

It too lacks a capabilities check and a security nonce. An authenticated user can change the plugin settings. Because the saved data isn’t sanitised, it is also possible to inject JavaScript code into the “btnText” and “disBtntext” variables (text label displayed on the button inside the dashboard Toolbar). The code will be executed when a user is logged in:

### Recommendations

We recommend to uninstall this plugin as there isn’t any security patch available. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the author on September 24, 2020 and the issue was escalated to the WordPress Plugin Team on October 22, 2020. The plugin was removed from the repo on the same day.

Actually it’s quite impressive. It dont really need nothing like a special panel where you (person who want to edit the post), need to enter for edit it. Its simples, but i liked it.
Negative points its that it have some bugs… Yes. You can’t make text bold/italic/etc, because, if you select the text then click the button to make ir bold/italic, the text will be deselected. Its the same thing while trying to align images, the text will be deselect…
I thikn that making it possible to publish posts, whould be a great idea.

### Description

The WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to page content injection in versions up to, and including, 5.5. This is due to missing capability checks in the plugin's page-editing functionality. This makes it possible for low-authenticated attackers, such as subscribers, to edit/create any page or post on the blog.
