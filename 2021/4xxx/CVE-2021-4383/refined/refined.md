Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in the WordPress WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin (version 5.5 and below) related to CVE-2021-4383:

**Root Cause:**
- The plugin lacks proper authorization checks in its AJAX handlers, specifically `save_content_front` and `la_save_front_editor`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Authenticated Content Injection (via `save_content_front`):**
    *   The `save_content_front` function directly uses the `wp_update_post` function to save/update post content without verifying if the user has the required permissions.
    *   **Vulnerability**: Broken Access Control
    *   **Technical Details**: The `save_content_front` function takes the post ID, title and content from the request and updates the post using `wp_update_post()`.  No capability checks are made to verify if the user has permission to edit that particular post or page.
    *   **Weakness**: Missing capability checks in `save_content_front()`
    *   Additionally, due to the lack of a security nonce and use of `print_r($_REQUEST)`, a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists.

2.  **Authenticated Settings Change and Stored XSS (via `la_save_front_editor`):**
    *   The `save_admin_options` function directly uses `update_option` to save plugin settings from the request, with no capability checks or security nonce.
    *   **Vulnerability**: Broken Access Control
    *   **Technical Details**: The `save_admin_options` function takes settings from the request and updates the option 'la_front_editor' without checking the user's capability.
    *   **Weakness**: Missing capability checks and lack of sanitization in `save_admin_options()`.
    *   Because the saved data isn't sanitized, it is possible to inject javascript code into the "btnText" and "disBtntext" variables which are displayed in the dashboard, resulting in stored XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Content Injection:**
    *   Authenticated users (even those with low privileges such as "subscriber" role) can edit or create any post or page on the WordPress site, leading to content manipulation, defacement, or potentially further malicious activities.

2. **Settings Change:**
    * Authenticated users can modify plugin settings, which could lead to unexpected behavior or further exploit.

3. **Stored XSS:**
   * Malicious JavaScript code injected into the plugin's settings will be executed in the browser of any logged-in user who views the affected admin pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, admin account takeover or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The vulnerabilities are exploited through AJAX requests to the following actions:
   - `wp_ajax_save_content_front`
   - `wp_ajax_la_save_front_editor`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site. The minimum required role to exploit the vulnerabilities is 'subscriber'.

**Additional Details:**
- The plugin was removed from the WordPress plugin repository on October 23, 2020 due to the security issues and is no longer maintained.
- There is no known patch available, and the recommendation is to uninstall the plugin.
