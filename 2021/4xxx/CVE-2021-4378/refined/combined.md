### Description

The WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions like subscribers, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

# Multiple vulnerabilities in WordPress WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin (unpatched).

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [January 12, 2021 - 12:07pm [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:22pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress-wp-quick-frontend-editor-plugin-unpatched/)

The WordPress [WP Quick FrontEnd Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-quick-front-end-editor/) plugin (1,000+ active installations) is prone to a broken access control vulnerability affecting version 5.5 and below that could lead to authenticated content injection, stored XSS and settings change among other issues.

> This plugin does not seem to be maintained anymore and the vulnerability has never been fixed. Make sure to follow the recommendations below.

### Authenticated Content Injection

In the “plugin.class.php” script L15, the plugin registers the AJAX `save_content_front` action with the WordPress `wp_ajax_*` hook:

```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_save_content_front', array($this, 'save_content_front') );

```

The `save_content_front` function, L269, calls the WordPress `wp_update_post` function but doesn’t check if the user is allowed to create or modify the corresponding post or page:

```
function save_content_front(){

   extract($_REQUEST);
   print_r($_REQUEST);

   $thumb_id = get_post_thumbnail_id( $id );
   if ( isset($imagesrc) && $imagesrc != '' ) {
      set_post_thumbnail( $id, $imageid );
   } else{
      delete_post_thumbnail( $id );
   };

      $my_post = array(
      'ID'           => $id,
      'post_title'   => $title,
      'post_content' => $content,
   );

   wp_update_post( $my_post );
   die(0);
}

```

An authenticated user can edit/create any page or post on the blog.

Additionally, because the function lacks a security nonce, the call to the `print_r()` function L272 is prone to a reflected XSS via a CSRF attack.

### Authenticated Settings Change and Stored XSS

In the same “plugin.class.php” script L17, the plugin registers the AJAX `la_save_front_editor` action with the `wp_ajax_*` hook:

```
add_action('wp_ajax_la_save_front_editor', array($this, 'save_admin_options'));

```

The `save_admin_options` is found L33 and is used to save the plugin’s options:

```
function save_admin_options(){
   if (isset($_REQUEST)) {
      update_option( 'la_front_editor', $_REQUEST );
   }
   die(0);
}

```

It too lacks a capabilities check and a security nonce. An authenticated user can change the plugin settings. Because the saved data isn’t sanitised, it is also possible to inject JavaScript code into the “btnText” and “disBtntext” variables (text label displayed on the button inside the dashboard Toolbar). The code will be executed when a user is logged in:

### Recommendations

We recommend to uninstall this plugin as there isn’t any security patch available. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the author on September 24, 2020 and the issue was escalated to the WordPress Plugin Team on October 22, 2020. The plugin was removed from the repo on the same day.
