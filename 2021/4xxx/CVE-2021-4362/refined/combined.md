# WordPress Kiwi Social Sharing plugin fixed critical vulnerability.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [June 4, 2021 - 1:08pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-kiwi-social-sharing-plugin-fixed-critical-vulnerability/)

The WordPress [Kiwi Social Sharing](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kiwi-social-share/) plugin (10,000+ active installations) fixed a critical vulnerability affecting version 2.1.0 that could allow unauthenticated users to read and modify WordPress options in the database.

### Unauthenticated WordPress options change and read

Back in 2018, a critical vulnerability in the Kiwi Social Sharing plugin was actively exploited by hackers. It allowed an unauthenticated attacker to modify (and read) any WordPress option in the database in order, for instance, to create admin accounts by enabling registration and setting the user default role to administrator, or to modify the value of `siteurl` in order to redirect all traffic to an external malicious website. The vulnerability was [fixed in version 2.0.11](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1973204/kiwi-social-share/trunk/includes/lib/helpers/class-kiwi-social-share-helper.php?old=1922991&old_path=kiwi-social-share%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2Flib%2Fhelpers%2Fclass-kiwi-social-share-helper.php) released on November 12, 2018. However, while auditing plugins installed on a hacked WordPress site a few weeks ago, I noticed that the latest version of the plugin was prone to the same vulnerability again. After checking the plugin’s revision log, it appeared the security fix was [undone in version 2.1.0](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2464137/kiwi-social-share/trunk/includes/lib/helpers/class-kiwi-social-share-helper.php?old=1985953&old_path=kiwi-social-share%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2Flib%2Fhelpers%2Fclass-kiwi-social-share-helper.php) released on January 2021:

```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_kiwi_social_share_get_option', 'kiwi_social_share_get_option' );
add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_kiwi_social_share_get_option', 'kiwi_social_share_get_option' );
add_action( 'wp_ajax_kiwi_social_share_set_option', 'kiwi_social_share_set_option' );
add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_kiwi_social_share_set_option', 'kiwi_social_share_set_option' );

/**
 *
 */
function kiwi_social_share_get_option() {
   if ( !empty( $_POST ) && $_POST[ 'action' ] === 'kiwi_social_share_get_option' ) {
      wp_die( json_encode( Kiwi_Social_Share_Helper::get_setting_value( $_POST[ 'args' ][ 'option' ], $_POST[ 'args' ][ 'default' ], $_POST[ 'args' ][ 'group' ] ) ) );
   }

   wp_die( 'Forbidden' );
}

function kiwi_social_share_set_option() {
   if ( !empty( $_POST ) && $_POST[ 'action' ] === 'kiwi_social_share_set_option' ) {
      $option                                = get_option( $_POST[ 'args' ][ 'group' ] );
      $option[ $_POST[ 'args' ][ 'option' ] ]  = $_POST[ 'args' ][ 'value' ];
      update_option( $_POST[ 'args' ][ 'group' ], $option );
      wp_die( 'Success' );
   }

   wp_die( 'Forbidden' );
}

```
### Recommendations

Update immediately if you are using version 2.1.0. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you were already protected against this vulnerability.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the WordPress Plugin Team on April 15, 2021 and a new version 2.1.3 was released on May 28.

### Description

The Kiwi Social Share plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the kiwi\_social\_share\_get\_option() function called via the kiwi\_social\_share\_get\_option AJAX action in version 2.1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read and modify arbitrary options on a WordPress site that can be used for complete site takeover. This was a previously fixed vulnerability that was reintroduced in this version.

Hello.
The buttons look perfect and it works great, but the best thing by far is the support.
I had a problem and I reported it on a Sunday afternoon, well, the next day, Monday, at just over ten in the morning they released an update that corrected the problem. There are payment services that are far from having such fast and effective attention.
Best regards
Carlos.

I like Kiwi over the other social sharing plugins I have tried because it is easy to use (I am a non-technical user), the share buttons look great and when I asked for support it arrived quickly, in plain english and with enough instructions.
Thank you

I was looking for a simple social sharing plugin that allowed me to share a few social sharing buttons like Facebook and Twitter. So far this plugin fits my needs and works well in my site. There is also a pro version if you need to add more social sharing services to your site.
Well done.
Kind regards

This is a horribly restricted plugin. Doesnt seem to support many social media sharing options, including email or RSS in free mode.
Also doesnt let you just add this to posts. As a result, its a big fail.
