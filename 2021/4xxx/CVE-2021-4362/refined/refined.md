The provided content describes a critical vulnerability in the WordPress Kiwi Social Sharing plugin.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check in the `kiwi_social_share_get_option()` and `kiwi_social_share_set_option()` functions, which are called via AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to check user capabilities before allowing access to the `kiwi_social_share_get_option` and `kiwi_social_share_set_option` functions.
- **Arbitrary Options Read:** The `kiwi_social_share_get_option()` function allows unauthenticated users to read arbitrary WordPress options.
- **Arbitrary Options Change:** The `kiwi_social_share_set_option()` function allows unauthenticated users to modify arbitrary WordPress options.
- **Reintroduction of vulnerability:** A previous security fix for the same vulnerability was undone in version 2.1.0.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Site Takeover:** By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can modify critical WordPress options, potentially leading to a complete site takeover. This can be achieved by:
    - Creating admin accounts by enabling registration and setting the default user role to administrator.
    - Modifying the `siteurl` option to redirect all traffic to a malicious external website.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can read sensitive data by reading WordPress options.
- **Website Defacement/Malware Injection:** Modified options can be used to inject malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **AJAX Actions:** The vulnerable functions are accessed via AJAX requests (`wp_ajax_kiwi_social_share_get_option` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_kiwi_social_share_get_option` , `wp_ajax_kiwi_social_share_set_option` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_kiwi_social_share_set_option`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the target WordPress site.
- **No Authentication Required:** No user authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- The vulnerability affects versions 2.1.0 to 2.1.2 of the Kiwi Social Sharing plugin.
**Patched Version:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.1.3.
