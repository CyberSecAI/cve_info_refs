Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of the `file_get_contents` function without proper validation of the input file. Specifically, the plugin does not verify if the file supplied is an SVG image when rendering an "Info Box" element.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary files on the server. The lack of input sanitization or validation on the file path allows an attacker to provide a path to any file accessible to the webserver user, leading to disclosure of sensitive data.
*   **External Control of File Name or Path:** The file path is controlled by an external input (user-supplied via the Elementor page builder).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, including configuration files, database credentials, and other potentially confidential data. This information can be used for further attacks or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the "Info Box" element of the Elementor page builder, where a user can specify an SVG image. An attacker could manipulate this field to provide a path to a file they want to read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to edit Elementor pages. This vulnerability affects users with "Contributor" level access or higher.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Plugins:**
    *   The Plus Addons for Elementor PRO versions up to 4.1.9
    *   The Plus Addons for Elementor versions up to 2.0.6
*   **Patched Versions:**
    *   The Plus Addons for Elementor PRO versions 4.1.10 and above
    *   The Plus Addons for Elementor versions 2.0.7 and above
*   The vulnerability was publicly published on April 14, 2021.
