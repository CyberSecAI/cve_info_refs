### Bug Description

SIGSEGV during processing of Unicode string

# Description

During extraction of the attached zip archive via

```

unzip $PWD/1ba59e08e410ce4bd897dd4ef3d0f59ca26b34f76de51d3b4382d72b8ae0d40d\_SIGSEGV

```

a null pointer dereference is triggered and causes a SIGSEGV. The bug appears to be located in the code responsible for handling Unicode strings. This allows an attacker to perform a denial of service and possibly opens up other attack vectors.

For reproduction of the crash a script called ./reproduce.sh is provided alongside the crashing input. If you need further details, please do not hesitate to ask.

Thanks for reporting this issue - have you tried reporting this to the upstream developers at all? I am not sure if it is still maintained but historically issues in UnZip were wanted to be reported via <http://infozip.sourceforge.net/zip-bug.html> - if you have not already could you please try reporting this there? If you do get a response, please let us know as well. Thanks.

Hello Alex,

since the last release on <http://infozip.sourceforge.net> is from 2009 and the unzip package in the Ubuntu repository is bundled with a bunch of more recent patches for different CVEs, I strongly believe the upstream project is abandoned. Nevertheless, I reported the bug via the URL you provided to me. I believe the person who created the different CVE patches should know the best how to proceed with this report?

Thanks!

Thanks - it looks like previous issues have ended up just going to the oss-security mailing list:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/12/05/13>

Perhaps it is best to just make this public and request a CVE be assigned there - that way all distros etc can be notified and you can get appropriate credit etc?

### Bug Description

SIGSEGV during processing of Unicode string

# Description

During extraction of the attached zip archive via

```

unzip $PWD/1ba59e08e410ce4bd897dd4ef3d0f59ca26b34f76de51d3b4382d72b8ae0d40d\_SIGSEGV

```

a null pointer dereference is triggered and causes a SIGSEGV. The bug appears to be located in the code responsible for handling Unicode strings. This allows an attacker to perform a denial of service and possibly opens up other attack vectors.

For reproduction of the crash a script called ./reproduce.sh is provided alongside the crashing input. If you need further details, please do not hesitate to ask.

Thanks for reporting this issue - have you tried reporting this to the upstream developers at all? I am not sure if it is still maintained but historically issues in UnZip were wanted to be reported via <http://infozip.sourceforge.net/zip-bug.html> - if you have not already could you please try reporting this there? If you do get a response, please let us know as well. Thanks.

Hello Alex,

since the last release on <http://infozip.sourceforge.net> is from 2009 and the unzip package in the Ubuntu repository is bundled with a bunch of more recent patches for different CVEs, I strongly believe the upstream project is abandoned. Nevertheless, I reported the bug via the URL you provided to me. I believe the person who created the different CVE patches should know the best how to proceed with this report?

Thanks!

Thanks - it looks like previous issues have ended up just going to the oss-security mailing list:

Perhaps it is best to just make this public and request a CVE be assigned there - that way all distros etc can be notified and you can get appropriate credit etc?
