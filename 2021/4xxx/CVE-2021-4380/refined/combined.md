### Description

The Pinterest Automatic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on the 'wp\_pinterest\_automatic\_parse\_request' function and the 'process\_form.php' script in versions up to, and including, 1.14.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on a site that can be used to create new administrative user accounts or redirect unsuspecting site visitors.

# Critical vulnerability fixed in WordPress Pinterest Automatic plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [September 6, 2021 - 12:51pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/critical-vulnerability-fixed-in-wordpress-pinterest-automatic-plugin/)

[WordPress Pinterest Automatic](https://codecanyon.net/item/pinterest-automatic-pin-wordpress-plugin/2203314) plugin (7,000+ sales on Envato Market) fixed a critical vulnerability affecting version 4.14.3 and below that could allow unauthenticated users to take over the website and its database.

### Unauthenticated Arbitrary WordPress Options Change

CVSS v3.1: [9.8 (Critical)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

In the “wp-pinterest-automatic/pinterest-auto.php” main script, WordPress Pinterest Automatic registers the `wp_pinterest_automatic_parse_request` action with the `parse_request` hook, i.e., when all query variables for the current request have been parsed:

```
 940    /**
 941    * custom request for fetch boards
 942    */
 943   function wp_pinterest_automatic_parse_request($wp) {
 944
 945      // only process requests with "my-plugin=ajax-handler"
 946      if (array_key_exists('wp_pinterest_automatic', $wp->query_vars)) {
 947
 948         if($wp->query_vars['wp_pinterest_automatic'] == 'boards'){
 949
 950            require_once('p_core.php');
 951           exit;
 952
 953         }elseif($wp->query_vars['wp_pinterest_automatic'] == 'settings'){
 954
 955            require_once('process_form.php');
 956            exit;
                ...
                ...
                ...
1067    }
1068    add_action('parse_request', 'wp_pinterest_automatic_parse_request');

```

If the `wp_pinterest_automatic` query var is set to `settings`, it loads the “process\_form.php” script:

```
<?php
/**
 * Created with Visual Form Builder by 23rd and Walnut
 * www.visualformbuilder.com
 * www.23andwalnut.com
 */

$form = new ProcessForm();
$form->field_rules = array(
   'field1'=>'required',
   'field3'=>'required',
   'field4'=>'required',
   'field5'=>'required',
   'field6'=>'required'
);
$form->validate();

class ProcessForm
{
   public $field_rules;
   public $error_messages;
   public $fields;
   private $error_list;
   private $is_xhr;

```

Line 44, it assigns the `POST` payload to `$this->fields` and, in the `process` method lines 117-119, it takes every key/value pairs found in it and passes them on to the WordPress `update_option` function.

Neither the `wp_pinterest_automatic_parse_request` function nor the “process\_form.php” script have a capability check to restrict access to that code. They also lack a security nonce.

An unauthenticated user can modify every WordPress options in the database in order, for instance, to create an administrator account or redirect all traffic to an external malicious website among many other possibilities.
