{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2021-4041",
    "description": "A flaw was found in ansible-runner. An improper escaping of the shell command, while calling the ansible_runner.interface.run_command, can lead to parameters getting executed as host's shell command. A developer could unintentionally write code that gets executed in the host rather than the virtual environment.",
    "root_cause": "Improper shell escaping when calling the `ansible_runner.interface.run_command` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Command injection vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Unintended execution of shell commands on the host system. A developer could unintentionally write code that gets executed in the host rather than the virtual environment. This could lead to privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution on the host.",
     "attack_vector": "An attacker could craft malicious input for the ansible-runner, causing unintended shell commands to be executed when the `run_command` function is called.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the command and arguments passed to the `run_command` function. This could be through direct control of parameters, or through a compromised Ansible playbook.",
	"fix": "The vulnerability was fixed by removing the shell use in subprocess. Instead of passing a string to `Popen`, the command and arguments are passed as a list which prevents shell interpretation and command injection."
