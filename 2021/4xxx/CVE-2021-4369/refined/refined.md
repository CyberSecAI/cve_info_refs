Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4369:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks and security measures in the "Frontend File Manager" plugin for WordPress, specifically within the `wpfm_edit_file_title_desc` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user is authorized to edit the content and title of a post.
2.  **Lack of Security Nonce:** The `wpfm_edit_file_title_desc` AJAX action lacks a security nonce, which is used to verify the authenticity of a request.
3.  **Insecure Data Handling:** The plugin uses `esc_attr` to sanitize the post title which is not sufficient, allowing for JavaScript code injection.
4.  **Insecure User ID retrieval**: The plugin uses a function that allows overriding user ID by using GET parameters, leading to privilege escalation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Unauthenticated Content Injection:** An unauthenticated attacker can edit the title and content of any post or page on the WordPress site.
2.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into post titles, which is executed when an administrator visits the plugin's settings page, potentially leading to account compromise, arbitrary actions, or further attacks.
3.  **Privilege Escalation**: Attacker can use any user id to manipulate data associated with that user.
4.  **Settings change**: An authenticated user can modify the plugin's settings, including adding 'php' to allowed file types.
5.  **Arbitrary File Upload:**  By modifying the allowed file types, an attacker can upload PHP scripts which can be executed.
6. **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** An unauthenticated user can delete every page and post on the blog.
7. **Arbitrary File Download:** An unauthenticated user can change post meta data to download arbitrary files from the server.
8. **HTML injection / spam relay:** An unauthenticated user can send HTML formatted emails using the blog as a spam relay.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Direct AJAX Request:** The `wpfm_edit_file_title_desc` AJAX action is directly accessible without authentication. Attackers can craft HTTP requests to this endpoint.
2.  **GET parameter manipulation**: Attacker can change the user id via GET parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **No authentication:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site.
2.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details (From blog.nintechnet.com):**
*   The vulnerability exists because of insecure coding practices within the plugin, specifically concerning how it handles AJAX requests.
*   The `wpfm_get_current_user` function is vulnerable to privilege escalation.
*   The `wpfm_save_settings` function is vulnerable to arbitrary settings change via authenticated access.
*   The `wpfm_delete_file` function allows for unauthenticated arbitrary post deletion.
*   The `wpfm_file_meta_update` function allows for unauthenticated post meta changes and arbitrary file downloads.
*   The `wpfm_send_file_in_email` function allows for unauthenticated HTML injection and spam relay.
*   The issue was reported on May 20, 2021, and a fix was released in version 18.3 on June 26, 2021.
