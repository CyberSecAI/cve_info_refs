The provided content is related to a commit that addresses an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The original code used string concatenation to build the SQL query, which is vulnerable to SQL injection if user input is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The `addHighscore` function in `data/db-handler.php` was vulnerable to SQL injection due to directly inserting unsanitized input into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could manipulate the SQL query to perform unauthorized database actions like reading, modifying, or deleting data, potentially compromising the application and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the `$name` parameter when submitting a high score.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application in a way that allows submitting high scores with custom names.
