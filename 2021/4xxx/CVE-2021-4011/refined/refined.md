{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Can lead to local privileges elevation on systems where the X server is running privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attacker with the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system or via ssh X forwarding sessions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
