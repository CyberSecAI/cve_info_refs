Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4325 (based on the context provided, the content addresses a fix for a cross-site scripting vulnerability)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of HTML content within the legend fields of the tui.chart library. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts through the chart's legend.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where unsanitized HTML input can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. Specifically, the legend fields of the chart are susceptible.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The code was not properly sanitizing HTML before rendering it in the legend, allowing execution of injected script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to various impacts.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The injected script could potentially steal user data, manipulate content on the page, or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Session Hijacking:** Injected scripts could steal session cookies to impersonate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Legend Data:** The attacker would inject malicious HTML containing JavaScript into the data used to generate the chart legend.
- **Application Rendering:** When the application renders the chart and its legend, the injected script would be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Control Chart Data:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the data used to generate the chart, specifically the legend content.
- **Target Application:** The application using tui.chart must be vulnerable (i.e., not using a version with the fix implemented).

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves sanitizing the HTML in `tooltip.ts` before rendering, using a new `htmlSanitizer.ts` file.
- `htmlSanitizer.ts` implements a whitelist-based approach for HTML attributes, removing potentially dangerous tags and attributes (like `script`, `iframe`, `on*` event attributes, and attributes with javascript URLs like `href` and `src`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes commit details showing the specific code changes that address this vulnerability, including the addition of `htmlSanitizer.ts` and modification of `tooltip.ts`.
- The vulnerability was resolved in pull request #604 and included in the v4.2.0 release.
- It highlights the importance of proper input validation and sanitization when dealing with user-controlled data that might be rendered as HTML on the page.
