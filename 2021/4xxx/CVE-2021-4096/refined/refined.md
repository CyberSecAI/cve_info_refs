**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The content directly mentions "Fancy Product Designer <= 4.7.5 â€“ Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload" and specifically cites the CVE ID: "CVE-2021-4096". Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper CSRF protection in the `FPD_Admin_Import` class, specifically in the import functionality of the Fancy Product Designer plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin's import function lacks nonce validation, enabling CSRF attacks.
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Successful exploitation of the CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including potentially malicious ones.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to gain webshell access to the server. This means they can execute arbitrary code and potentially take control of the entire website and the server it is on.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through a forged request that is initiated by the attacker and tricked the website administrator to execute.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request.
    *   The attacker must be able to convince a site administrator to perform an action, such as clicking a malicious link, that triggers the crafted request and uploads a malicious file.
