Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the commit `70daa537adfa47b87af12d85f1e698fff01785ff` which addresses a security vulnerability described as `[KVE-2020-1616]그누보드 메인화면 XSS 취약점 수정`:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issue in the main screen of the "그누보드" (GnuBoard) application. Specifically, it was located within the `adm/menu_list_update.php` file. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input related to the menu link (`me_link`) field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The code was vulnerable to XSS because it allowed JavaScript code within the `me_link` field. It was possible to inject malicious javascript through `me_link`. The code initially used `clean_xss_tags` and `clean_xss_attributes` to sanitize the input but did not completely filter out javascript keywords, specifically when those were preceded with spaces or tabs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies and other sensitive information
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `adm/menu_list_update.php` file, specifically by injecting malicious javascript code into the `me_link` field of the menu items.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a request to `adm/menu_list_update.php` containing malicious javascript code in `me_link`. This likely requires admin or privileged access to the system to modify the menus.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit (`70daa537adfa47b87af12d85f1e698fff01785ff`) specifically modifies `adm/menu_list_update.php` to add a check for javascript code in `me_link`.
- The fix implemented in this commit involves:
  - Removing extra spaces and tabs from the `me_link` using `preg_replace('/[ ]{1,}|[\t]/', '', ...)`
  - Checking if the value contains `javascript` keyword, if so, it replaces the malicious input with a URL `G5_URL`.
  - Adding another cleanup for extra spaces before sanitizing the link, using  `preg_replace('/[ ]{2,}|[\t]/', '', ...)`
- The commit message `[KVE-2020-1616]그누보드 메인화면 XSS 취약점 수정` confirms that this commit is a fix for a known vulnerability (KVE-2020-1616) which is related to the GnuBoard application main screen and XSS.
