Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Firefox handles `<meta>` refresh tags within XSLT stylesheets.  Specifically, the browser was special-casing meta refreshes in XSLT, leading to a bypass of iframe sandbox restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Iframe Sandbox Bypass:**  The core issue is that the special handling of meta refreshes within XSLT allowed a malicious actor to bypass the intended security restrictions imposed by the `<iframe>` sandbox attribute.
- **XSLT Processing Issue:** The vulnerability lies in the way XSLT stylesheets were processed when combined with meta refreshes, which didn't adhere to the security policies enforced by iframes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit would allow an attacker to execute code that should have been blocked by the iframe's sandbox. This bypass could be used to:
    - Redirect the user to a different website
    - Potentially execute malicious scripts within a context that should have been restricted.
    - Lead to other exploits or attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious XSLT stylesheet containing a `<meta>` refresh tag.
- This malicious stylesheet could then be loaded within an `<iframe>` element on a compromised or attacker-controlled website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve or inject a page containing a malicious iframe with a crafted XSLT stylesheet.
- No special privileges or local access is required, only the ability to deliver a webpage to a target.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is described as 'sec-high'
- The fix involves removing the special handling of meta refresh for XSLT, making it behave the same way as it does for non-XSLT loads, which is the more secure way.
- The issue was resolved in Firefox 96, Firefox ESR 91.5, and Thunderbird 91.5.
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2021-38503
