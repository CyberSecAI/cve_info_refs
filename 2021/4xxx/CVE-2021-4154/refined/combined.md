# Security bulletins

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

---

All security bulletins for the following products are described in this page:

* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
* Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on VMware
* GKE on AWS
* GKE on Azure
* Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on bare metal

Vulnerabilities are often kept secret under embargo until affected parties have
had a chance to address them. In these cases, the product's release notes will
refer to "security updates" until the embargo has been lifted. At that point the
notes will be updated to reflect the vulnerability the patch addressed.

**Note:** If you run multi-tenant workloads on GKE or GDC (VMware),
please pay particular attention to these bulletins. These vulnerabilities are
more likely to impact multi-tenant workloads. For a technical description of
security boundaries in GKE or GDC (VMware) and how these impact workloads,
see
[Isolation at different layers of the Kubernetes stack](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/05/Exploring-container-security-Isolation-at-different-layers-of-the-Kubernetes-stack.html).

When GKE issues a security bulletin that directly correlates to
your cluster configuration or version, we might send you a `SecurityBulletinEvent`
cluster notification that provides information about the vulnerability and actions
that you can take, if applicable. For information about setting up cluster
notifications, refer to [Cluster notifications](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-notifications#securitybulletin).

For more information on how Google manages security vulnerabilities and patches
for GKE and GKE Enterprise, see [Security patching](/kubernetes-engine/docs/resources/security-patching).

GKE and GKE Enterprise platforms don't use components
such as `ingress-nginx` and the CRI-O container runtime, and are unaffected
by any vulnerabilities in those components. If you install components from
other sources, refer to the security updates and patching advice of those
components at the source.

**Reference:** [CVE-2024-10220](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-10220)

### GKE

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| A security issue discovered in Kubernetes clusters could result in remote code execution using a `gitRepo` volume. If the git repository is maliciously constructed, a user with the ability to create a Pod and associate a `gitRepo` volume could execute arbitrary commands beyond the container boundary. What should I do? Upgrade your GKE cluster and node pools to a patched version. The following GKE versions have been updated to fix this vulnerability:   * 1.27.16-gke.1008000 * 1.28.12-gke.1052000 * 1.29.7-gke.1008000 * 1.30.3-gke.1225000 * 1.31.0-gke.1058000   For security purposes, even with node auto-upgrade enabled, we recommend [manually upgrading](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-cluster) your cluster and node pools to a patched GKE version. GKE [release channels](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels#newer-patch-versions) allow you to patch without having to unsubscribe or change release channels. This lets you secure your cluster and nodes before the new version becomes the default on your selected release channel. What vulnerabilities are addressed by this patch? CVE-2024-10220 allows an attacker to create a Pod and associate a `gitRepo` volume to execute arbitrary commands beyond the container boundary. | High |

### GKE

**Updated:** 2024-07-03

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| **2024-07-03 Update:** An expedited rollout is in progress and is expected to make new patch versions available across all zones by July 3, 2024 at 5 PM US and Canadian Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7). To get a notification as soon as a patch is available for your specific cluster, use [cluster notifications](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-notifications#overview).   ---   **2024-07-02 Update:** This vulnerability affects both Autopilot mode and Standard mode clusters. Each section that follows will tell you the modes to which that section applies.   ---   A remote code execution vulnerability, [CVE-2024-6387](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-6387), was recently discovered in OpenSSH. The vulnerability exploits a race condition that could be used to obtain access to a remote shell, enabling attackers to gain root access to GKE nodes. At the time of publication, exploitation is believed to be difficult and take several hours per machine being attacked. We are not aware of any exploitation attempts.  All supported versions of Container Optimized OS and Ubuntu images on GKE run versions of OpenSSH that are vulnerable to this issue.  GKE clusters with public node IP addresses and SSH exposed to the Internet should be treated with the highest priority for mitigation.  The GKE control plane is not vulnerable to this issue. What should I do?**2024-07-03 Update: Patch versions for GKE** An expedited rollout is in progress and is expected to make new patch versions available across all zones by July 3, 2024 at 5 PM US and Canadian Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7).  Clusters and nodes with autoupgrade enabled will begin upgrading as the week progresses, but due to the severity of the vulnerability we recommend upgrading manually as follows to get patches as fast as possible.  For both Autopilot and Standard clusters, [upgrade your control plane](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-cluster#upgrade_cp) to a patched version. Additionally, for Standard mode clusters, [upgrade your node pools](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-cluster#upgrade_nodes) to a patched version. Autopilot clusters will begin upgrading your nodes to match the control plane version [as soon as possible](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-upgrades-autopilot#manual-upgrade).  Patched GKE versions are available for every supported version to minimize the changes necessary to apply the patch. The version number of each new version is an increment on the final digit in the version number of a corresponding existing version. For example, if you are on 1.27.14-gke.1100000, you will upgrade to 1.27.14-gke.1100002 to get the fix with the smallest possible change. The following patched GKE versions are available:   * 1.26.15-gke.1090004 * 1.26.15-gke.1191001 * 1.26.15-gke.1300001 * 1.26.15-gke.1320002 * 1.26.15-gke.1381001 * 1.26.15-gke.1390001 * 1.26.15-gke.1404002 * 1.26.15-gke.1469001 * 1.27.13-gke.1070002 * 1.27.13-gke.1166001 * 1.27.13-gke.1201002 * 1.27.14-gke.1022001 * 1.27.14-gke.1042001 * 1.27.14-gke.1059002 * 1.27.14-gke.1100002 * 1.27.15-gke.1012003 * 1.28.9-gke.1069002 * 1.28.9-gke.1209001 * 1.28.9-gke.1289002 * 1.28.10-gke.1058001 * 1.28.10-gke.1075001 * 1.28.10-gke.1089002 * 1.28.10-gke.1148001 * 1.28.11-gke.1019001 * 1.29.4-gke.1043004 * 1.29.5-gke.1060001 * 1.29.5-gke.1091002 * 1.29.6-gke.1038001 * 1.30.1-gke.1329003 * 1.30.2-gke.1023004   To check whether a patch is available in your cluster zone or region, run the following command:  ``` gcloud container get-server-config --location=LOCATION ```  Replace `LOCATION` with your zone or region.   ---   **2024-07-02 Update:** Both Autopilot mode and Standard mode clusters should be upgraded as soon as possible after patch versions are available.   ---   A patched GKE version that includes an updated OpenSSH will be made available as soon as possible. This bulletin will be updated when patches are available. To receive a Pub/Sub notification when a patch is available for your channel, [enable cluster notifications](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-notifications#overview). We recommend working through the following steps to check your cluster's exposure, and applying the mitigations described, as necessary. Determine whether your nodes have public IP addresses **2024-07-02 Update:** This section applies to both Autopilot and Standard clusters.   ---   If a cluster is created with [`enable-private-nodes`](/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create#--enable-private-nodes), nodes will be private, which mitigates the vulnerability by removing exposure to the Internet. Run the following command to determine if your cluster has private nodes enabled:  ``` gcloud container clusters describe $CLUSTER_NAME \ --format="value(privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateNodes)" ```  If the return value is True, all nodes are private nodes for this cluster and the vulnerability is mitigated. If the value is empty or false, continue on to apply one of the mitigations in the following sections.  To find all clusters originally created with public nodes, use this [Cloud Asset Inventory query](/asset-inventory/docs/query-assets) in the project or organization:  ``` SELECT   resource.data.name AS cluster_name,   resource.parent AS project_name,   resource.data.privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateNodes FROM   `container_googleapis_com_Cluster` WHERE   resource.data.privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateNodes is null OR   resource.data.privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateNodes = false ``` Disallow SSH to the cluster nodes **2024-07-02 Update:** This section applies to both Autopilot and Standard clusters.   ---   The default network is pre-populated with a `default-allow-ssh` firewall rule to allow SSH access from the public Internet. To remove this access, you can:   * Optionally [create rules](/firewall/docs/using-firewalls#creating_firewall_rules)   to allow any SSH access you need from trusted networks to GKE nodes   or other Compute Engine VMs in the project. * Disable the default firewall rule with the following command:   `gcloud compute firewall-rules update default-allow-ssh --disabled --project=$PROJECT`   If you have created any other firewall rules that may allow SSH through TCP on port 22, disable them, or limit the source IPs to trusted networks.  Verify that you can no longer [SSH to the cluster nodes](/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/vmware/docs/how-to/ssh-cluster-node) from the Internet. This firewall configuration mitigates the vulnerability. Convert public node pools to private **2024-07-02 Update:** For Autopilot clusters originally created as public clusters, you can place your workloads on private nodes [by using nodeSelectors](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/change-cluster-isolation#isolate_node_pool). However, Autopilot nodes that run system workloads on clusters that were originally created as public clusters will still be public nodes and should be protected by using the firewall changes described in the preceding section.   ---   To best protect clusters originally created with public nodes, we recommend first disallowing SSH through the firewall as already described. If you are not able to disallow SSH through the firewall rules, you can convert public node pools on GKE Standard clusters to private by [following this guidance to isolate node pools](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/change-cluster-isolation#isolate_node_pool). Change SSHD configuration **2024-07-02 Update:** This section only applies to Standard clusters. Autopilot workloads aren't allowed to modify node configuration.   ---   If none of these mitigations can be applied, we have also [published a daemonset](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-node-tools/tree/master/ssh-server-config) that sets SSHD `LoginGraceTime` to zero, and restarts the SSH daemon. This daemonset can be applied to the cluster to mitigate the attack. Note that this configuration may increase the risk of denial of service attacks and may cause issues with legitimate SSH access. This daemonset should be removed after a patch has been applied. | Critical |

Disallow SSH to the cluster nodes You can change your infrastructure network setup to disallow SSH connectivity from untrusted sources, such as the public Internet. Change sshd configuration If you can't apply the preceding mitigation, we have [published a DaemonSet](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-node-tools/tree/master/ssh-server-config) that sets the sshd `LoginGraceTime` to zero and restarts the SSH daemon. This DaemonSet can be applied to the cluster to mitigate the attack. Note that this configuration might increase the risk of denial of service attacks and might cause issues with legitimate SSH access. Remove this DaemonSet after a patch has been applied.   ---   **Note:** Patch versions for GDC software for VMware are in progress.

### GKE on AWS

**Updated:** 2024-07-11

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| **2024-07-11 Update:**  The following versions of GKE on AWS have been updated with code to fix this vulnerability:  * 1.27.14-gke.1200 * 1.28.10-gke.1300 * 1.29.5-gke.1100   Upgrade your GKE on AWS control plane and node pools to one of these patched versions or later. For instructions, see [Upgrade your AWS cluster version](/kubernetes-engine/multi-cloud/docs/aws/how-to/upgrade-cluster) and [Update a node pool](/kubernetes-engine/multi-cloud/docs/aws/how-to/update-node-pool).   ---   **2024-07-02 Update:** All supported versions of Ubuntu images on GKE on AWS run versions of OpenSSH that are vulnerable to this issue.  GKE on AWS clusters with public node IP addresses and SSH exposed to the Internet should be treated with the highest priority for mitigation.   ---   A remote code execution vulnerability, [CVE-2024-6387](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-6387), was recently discovered in OpenSSH. The vulnerability exploits a race condition that could be used to obtain access to a remote shell, enabling attackers to gain root access to GKE nodes. At the time of publication, exploitation is believed to be difficult and take several hours per machine being attacked. We are not aware of any exploitation attempts. What should I do? **2024-07-02 Update:** A patched GKE on AWS version that includes an updated OpenSSH will be made available as soon as possible. This bulletin will be updated when patches are available. We recommend that you work through the following steps to check your cluster's exposure, and apply the described mitigations as necessary. Determine whether your nodes have public IP addresses GKE on AWS doesn't provision any machine with either public IP addresses or with firewall rules that allow traffic to port 22 by default. However, depending on your [subnet configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#vpc-public-ipv4-addresses), machines can automatically get a public IP address during provisioning.  To check whether nodes are provisioned with public IP addresses, [look at the configuration of the subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/modify-subnets.html#view-subnet) that's associated with your AWS node pool resource. Disallow SSH to the cluster nodes Even though GKE on AWS doesn't allow traffic on port 22 on any node by default, customers can attach additional security groups to node pools, enabling inbound SSH traffic.  We recommend that you [remove or scope down](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#updating-security-group-rules) corresponding rules from the provided security groups. Convert public node pools to private To best protect clusters with public nodes, we recommend first disallowing SSH through your security group, as described in the previous section. If you can't disallow SSH through the security group rules, you can convert public node pools to private by [disabling the option to automatically assign public IPs to machines within a subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/modify-subnets.html#subnet-public-ip) and reprovisioning the node pool.   ---   **Note:** Patch versions for GKE on AWS are in progress.

### GKE on Azure

**Updated:** 2024-07-11

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| **2024-07-11 Update:**  The following versions of GKE on Azure have been updated with code to fix this vulnerability:  * 1.27.14-gke.1200 * 1.28.10-gke.1300 * 1.29.5-gke.1100   Upgrade your GKE on Azure control plane and node pools to one of these patched versions or later. For instructions, see [Upgrade your Azure cluster version](/kubernetes-engine/multi-cloud/docs/azure/how-to/upgrade-cluster) and [Update a node pool](/kubernetes-engine/multi-cloud/docs/azure/how-to/update-node-pool).   ---   **2024-07-02 Update:** All supported versions of Ubuntu images on GKE on Azure run versions of OpenSSH that are vulnerable to this issue.  GKE on Azure clusters with public node IP addresses and SSH exposed to the Internet should be treated with the highest priority for mitigation.   ---   A remote code execution vulnerability, [CVE-2024-6387](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-6387), was recently discovered in OpenSSH. The vulnerability exploits a race condition that could be used to obtain access to a remote shell, enabling attackers to gain root access to GKE nodes. At the time of publication, exploitation is believed to be difficult and take several hours per machine being attacked. We are not aware of any exploitation attempts. What should I do? **2024-07-02 Update:** A patched GKE on Azure version that includes an updated OpenSSH will be made available as soon as possible. This bulletin will be updated when patches are available. We recommend that you work through the following steps to check your cluster's exposure, and apply the described mitigations as necessary. Determine whether your nodes have public IP addresses GKE on Azure doesn't provision any machine with either [public IP addresses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses) or with firewall rules that allow traffic to port 22 by default. To review your Azure configuration to check whether there are any public IP addresses configured on your GKE on Azure cluster, run the following command:  ``` az network public-ip list -g CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -o tsv ``` Disallow SSH to the cluster nodes Even though GKE on Azure doesn't allow traffic on port 22 on any node by default, customers can update NetworkSecurityGroup rules to node pools, enabling inbound SSH traffic from the public internet.  We strongly recommend that you review the Network Security Groups (NSGs) associated with your Kubernetes clusters. If an NSG rule exists that allows unrestricted inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH), do one of the following:   * **Remove the rule entirely**: If SSH access to the cluster nodes isn't   required from the internet, remove the rule to eliminate potential attack vectors. * **Scope down the rule**: Restrict inbound access on port 22 to only the   specific IP addresses or ranges that require it. This minimizes the exposed surface for   potential attacks.  Convert public node pools to private To best protect clusters with public nodes, we recommend first disallowing SSH through your security group, as described in the previous section. If you can't disallow SSH through the security group rules, you can convert public node pools to private by removing the public IP addresses associated with the VMs.  To remove a public IP address from a VM and replace it with a private IP address configuration, see [Dissociate a public IP address from a an Azure VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/remove-public-ip-address-vm).  **Impact:**  Any existing connections using the public IP address will be disrupted. Ensure that you have alternative access methods in place, like a VPN or Azure Bastion.   ---   **Note:** Patch versions for GKE on Azure are in progress. We'll update this bulletin with that information when it's available. | Critical |

### GDC (bare metal)

**Updated:** 2024-07-02

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| **2024-07-02 Update:**  The original version of this bulletin for GDC software for bare metal incorrectly stated that patch versions were in progress. GDC software for bare metal is not directly affected because it doesn't manage the operating system SSH daemon or configuration. Patch versions are therefore the responsibility of the operating system provider, as described in the **What should I do?** section.   ---   A remote code execution vulnerability, [CVE-2024-6387](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-6387), was recently discovered in OpenSSH. The vulnerability exploits a race condition that could be used to obtain access to a remote shell, enabling attackers to gain root access to GKE nodes. At the time of publication, exploitation is believed to be difficult and take several hours per machine being attacked. We are not aware of any exploitation attempts. What should I do? **2024-07-02 Update:**  Contact your OS provider to obtain a patch for the operating systems in use with GDC software for bare metal.  Until you've applied the OS vendor patch, ensure that public reachable machines don't allow SSH connections from the internet. If that isn't possible, an alternative is to set the `LoginGraceTime` to zero and restart the sshd server:  ``` grep "^LoginGraceTime" /etc/ssh/sshd_config             LoginGraceTime 0 ```  Note that this configuration change might increase the risk of denial of service attacks and may cause issues with legitimate SSH access.   ---   **Original 2024-07-01 text (see the preceding 2024-07-02 update for a correction):**  **Note:** Patch versions for GDC software for bare metal are in progress. We'll update this bulletin with that information when it's available. | Critical |

### GKE

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2023-5528 allows an attacker to create pods and persistent volumes on Windows nodes in a way that enables admin privilege escalation on those nodes.  GKE Standard clusters running [Windows Server](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-images#windows-server) nodes and using an in-tree storage plugin might be affected.  GKE Autopilot clusters and GKE node pools using [GKE Sandbox](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/sandbox-pods) are not affected because they do not support Windows Server nodes. What should I do? Determine if you have Windows Server nodes in use on your clusters:  ``` kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/os=windows ```  Check audit logs for evidence of exploitation. Kubernetes audit logs can be audited to determine if this vulnerability is being exploited. Persistent Volume create events with local path fields containing special characters are a strong indication of exploitation.  Update your GKE cluster and node pools to a patched version. The following versions of GKE have been updated to fix this vulnerability. Even if you have node auto-upgrade enabled, we recommend that you [manually upgrade](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-container-cluster) your cluster and Windows Server node pools to one of the following GKE versions or later:   * 1.24.17-gke.6100 * 1.25.15-gke.2000 * 1.26.10-gke.2000 * 1.27.7-gke.2000 * 1.28.3-gke.1600   You can apply patch versions from newer release channels if your cluster runs the same minor version in its own release channel.

**2024-01-26 Update:**  Clarified the number of affected clusters and the actions that
we took to help mitigate the impact.

### GKE

**Updated:** 2024-01-26

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| **2024-01-26 Update**: Security research that found a small number of GKE clusters with a customer-created misconfiguration involving the `system:authenticated` group has now been published. The researcher's blog post refers to 1,300 clusters with some misconfigured bindings, and 108 with high privileges. We have worked closely with impacted customers to notify them and assist with removing their misconfigured bindings.   ---   We have identified several clusters where users have granted Kubernetes privileges to the `system:authenticated` group, which includes all users with a Google account. These types of bindings are [not recommended](/kubernetes-engine/docs/best-practices/rbac#default-roles-groups), as they violate the principle of least privilege and grant access to very large groups of users. See guidance under 'What should I do' for instructions on how to find these types of bindings.  Recently, a security researcher reported findings of clusters with RBAC misconfigurations through our vulnerability reporting program.  Google's approach to authentication is to make authenticating to Google Cloud and GKE as simple and secure as possible without adding complex configuration steps. *Authentication* just tells us who the user is; *Authorization* is where access is determined. So the `system:authenticated` group in GKE that contains all users authenticated through Google's identity provider is working as intended and functions in the same way as the [IAM allAuthenticatedUsers identifier](/iam/docs/overview#all-authenticated-users).  With this in mind we've taken several steps to reduce the risk of users making *authorization* errors with the Kubernetes built-in users and groups, including `system:anonymous`, `system:authenticated`, and `system:unauthenticated`. All of these users/groups represent a risk to the cluster if granted permissions. We discussed some of the attacker activity targeting RBAC misconfigurations and available defenses [at Kubecon in November 2023](https://kccncna2023.sched.com/event/1R2tp/rbacdoors-how-cryptominers-are-exploiting-rbac-misconfigs-greg-castle-vinayak-goyal-google).  To protect users from accidental authorization errors with these system users/groups, we have:   * [By   default blocked new bindings](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/best-practices/rbac#detect-prevent-default) of the highly privileged ClusterRole   `cluster-admin` to User `system:anonymous`, Group   `system:authenticated`, or Group `system:unauthenticated`   in GKE version 1.28. * Built detection rules into [Event   Threat Detection](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-event-threat-detection-overview#rules) (GKE\_CONTROL\_PLANE\_CREATE\_SENSITIVE\_BINDING) as part of   Security Command Center. * Built configurable prevention rules into Policy Controller with [K8sRestrictRoleBindings](/anthos-config-management/docs/latest/reference/constraint-template-library#k8srestrictrolebindings). * Sent email notifications to all GKE users with bindings to these   users/groups asking them to review their configuration. * Built network authorization features and [made   recommendations](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#restrict_network_access_to_the_control_plane_and_nodes) to restrict network access to clusters as a first layer of   defense. * Raised awareness about this issue [through   a talk at Kubecon in November 2023](https://kccncna2023.sched.com/event/1R2tp/rbacdoors-how-cryptominers-are-exploiting-rbac-misconfigs-greg-castle-vinayak-goyal-google).   Clusters that apply [authorized networks](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/authorized-networks) restrictions have a first layer of defense: they cannot be attacked directly from the Internet. But we still recommend removing these bindings for defense in depth and to guard against errors in network controls. Note there are a number of cases where bindings to Kubernetes system users or groups are used intentionally: e.g. for [kubeadm bootstrapping](/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/cluster-lifecycle/bootstrap-discovery#implementation-details), the [Rancher dashboard](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/blob/a5f90f1f356c5d7b8f701a19be0fb3f1dcb42c20/pkg/data/dashboard/rbac.go#L12) and [Bitnami sealed secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/commit/516503c3c5eb7a12786c6adb5fda681a372e2e5a). We have confirmed with those software vendors that those bindings are working as intended.  We are investigating ways we can further protect against user RBAC misconfiguration with these system users/groups through prevention and detection. What should I do? To prevent any *new* bindings of `cluster-admin` to User `system:anonymous`, Group `system:authenticated`, or Group `system:unauthenticated` users can upgrade to GKE v1.28 or later ([release notes](/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#September_18_2023)), where creation of those bindings are blocked.  Existing bindings should be reviewed [following this guidance](/kubernetes-engine/docs/best-practices/rbac#detect-prevent-default). | Medium |

### GKE

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| An attacker who has compromised the Fluent Bit logging container could combine that access with high privileges required by Cloud Service Mesh (on clusters that have enabled it) to escalate privileges in the cluster. The issues with Fluent Bit and Cloud Service Mesh have been mitigated and fixes are now available. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable on their own in GKE and require an initial compromise. We are not aware of any instances of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.  These issues were reported through our [Vulnerability Reward Program](https://bughunters.google.com/about). What should I do? The following versions of GKE have been updated with code to fix these vulnerabilities in Fluent Bit and for users of managed Cloud Service Mesh. For security purposes, even if you have node auto-upgrade enabled, we recommend that you [manually upgrade](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-container-cluster) your cluster and node pools to one of the following GKE versions or later:   * 1.25.16-gke.1020000 * 1.26.10-gke.1235000 * 1.27.7-gke.1293000 * 1.28.4-gke.1083000   A recent feature of [release channels](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels#newer-patch-versions) allows you to apply a patch without having to unsubscribe from a channel. This lets you secure your nodes until the new version becomes the default for your specific release channel  If your cluster uses in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh, you must [manually upgrade](/service-mesh/docs/unified-install/upgrade) to one of the following versions ([release notes](/service-mesh/docs/release-notes#December_12_2023)):   * 1.17.8-asm.8 * 1.18.6-asm.2 * 1.19.5-asm.4   **What vulnerabilities are being addressed by this patch?**  The vulnerabilities addressed by this bulletin require an attacker to compromise the Fluent Bit logging container. We are not aware of any existing vulnerabilities in Fluent Bit that would lead to this prerequisite condition for privilege escalation. We have patched these vulnerabilities as hardening measures to prevent a potential full attack chain in the future  GKE uses Fluent Bit to process logs for workloads running on clusters. Fluent Bit on GKE was also configured to collect logs for Cloud Run workloads. The volume mount configured to collect those logs gave Fluent Bit access to Kubernetes service account tokens for other Pods running on the node. The researcher used this access to discover a highly privileged service account token for clusters that have Cloud Service Mesh enabled.  Cloud Service Mesh required high privileges to make necessary modifications to a cluster's configuration including the ability to create and delete Pods. The researcher used Cloud Service Mesh's privileged Kubernetes service account token to escalate their initial compromised privileges by creating a new pod with cluster-admin privileges  We have removed Fluent Bit's access to the service account tokens and have redesigned the functionality of Cloud Service Mesh to remove excess privileges. | Medium |

### GKE

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| Three vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-3676, CVE-2023-3955, CVE-2023-3893) have been discovered in Kubernetes where a user that can create Pods on Windows nodes may be able to escalate to admin privileges on those nodes. These vulnerabilities affect the Windows versions of Kubelet and the Kubernetes CSI proxy.  GKE clusters are only affected if they include Windows nodes. What should I do? The following versions of GKE have been updated with code to fix this vulnerability. For security purposes, even if you have node auto-upgrade enabled, we recommend that you [manually upgrade](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-cluster) your cluster and node pools to one of the following GKE versions:   * 1.24.17-gke.200 * 1.25.13-gke.200 * 1.26.8-gke.200 * 1.27.5-gke.200 * 1.28.1-gke.200   The GKE control plane will be updated the week of 2023-09-04 to update the csi-proxy to version 1.1.3. If you update your nodes prior to the control plane update, you will need to update your nodes again after the update to take advantage of the new proxy. You can update the nodes again, even without changing the node version, by running the `gcloud container clusters upgrade` command and passing the `--cluster-version` flag with the same GKE version that the node pool is already running. You must use the gcloud CLI for this workaround. Note that this will cause an update regardless of [maintenance windows](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/maintenance-windows-and-exclusions#node-recreation-maintenance-windows).  A recent feature of [release channels](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels#newer-patch-versions) allows you to apply a patch without having to unsubscribe from a channel. This lets you secure your nodes until the new version becomes the default for your specific release channel. What vulnerabilities are addressed by this patch? With CVE-2023-3676, a malicious actor could craft a Pod spec with host path strings that contain PowerShell commands. Kubelet lacks input sanitization and passes this crafted path string to the command executor as an argument where it would execute parts of the string as separate commands. These commands would run with the same administrative privileges as Kubelet has.  With CVE-2023-3955, Kubelet grants users who can create Pods the ability to execute code at the same permission level as the Kubelet agent, privileged permissions.  With CVE-2023-3893, a similar lack of input sanitation lets a user who can create Pods on Windows nodes running kubernetes-csi-proxy to escalate to admin privileges on those nodes. Kubernetes audit logs can be used to detect if this vulnerability is being exploited. Pod create events with embedded PowerShell commands are a strong indication of exploitation. ConfigMaps and Secrets that contain embedded PowerShell commands and are mounted into Pods are also a strong indication of exploitation. | High |

**2023-08-11 Update:**  Added patch versions for GKE on VMware, GKE on AWS, GKE on Azure, and GKE on Bare Metal

### GKE

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| Two new security issues were discovered in Kubernetes where users may be able to launch containers that bypass policy restrictions when using ephemeral containers and either ImagePolicyWebhook (CVE-2023-2727) or the ServiceAccount admission plugin (CVE-2023-2728).  GKE does not use ImagePolicyWebhook and is not affected by CVE-2023-2727. All versions of GKE are potentially vulnerable to CVE-2023-2728.What should I do? The following versions of GKE have been updated with code to fix this vulnerability. For security purposes, even if you have node auto-upgrade enabled, we recommend that you [manually upgrade](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-container-cluster) your cluster and node pools to one of the following GKE versions:   * 1.27.2-gke.1200 * 1.26.5-gke.1200 * 1.25.10-gke.1200 * 1.24.14-gke.1200 * 1.23.17-gke.6800   A recent feature of [release channels](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels#newer-patch-versions) allows you to apply a patch without having to unsubscribe from a channel. This lets you secure your nodes until the new version becomes the default for your specific release channel. What vulnerabilities are being addressed? With CVE-2023-2727, users may be able to launch containers using images that are restricted by ImagePolicyWebhook when using ephemeral containers. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ImagePolicyWebhook admission plugin is used together with ephemeral containers. This CVE can also be mitigated by using validation webhooks, such as Gatekeeper and Kyverno, to enforce the same restrictions.  In CVE-2023-2728, users may be able to launch containers that bypass the mountable secrets policy enforced by the ServiceAccount admission plugin when using ephemeral containers. The policy ensures that Pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified in the service account's secrets field. Clusters are impacted by this vulnerability if:   * The ServiceAccount admission plugin is used. * The kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets annotation is used by a service account. This annotation is not added by default. * Pods are using ephemeral containers. | Medium |

| **Update 2022-08-11:** Added more information about the Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) configuration. SMT was intended to be disabled, but was enabled on the versions listed.  If you manually enabled SMT for a sandboxed node pool, SMT will remain manually enabled despite this issue.   ---   There is a misconfiguration with Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), also known as Hyper-threading, on GKE Sandbox images. The misconfiguration leaves nodes potentially exposed to side channel attacks such as Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) (for more context, see [GKE Sandbox documentation](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/sandbox-pods#hyper-threading_is_disabled)). We do not recommend using the following affected versions:  * 1.22.4-gke.1501 * 1.22.6-gke.300 * 1.23.2-gke.300 * 1.23.3-gke.600  If you manually [enabled SMT for a node pool](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/sandbox-pods#hyper-threading_is_disabled), then this issue does not affect your sandboxed nodes. What should I do? Upgrade your nodes to one of the following versions:  * 1.22.6-gke.1500 and later * 1.23.3-gke.1100 and later What vulnerability is addressed by this patch?

### GKE

| Description | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| **Update 2022-03-15:** Added hardening guides for GKE on AWS and GKE on Azure. Added a section on persistence using webhooks.   ---   Some unexpected paths to access the node VM on GKE Autopilot clusters could have been used to escalate privileges in the cluster. These issues have been fixed and **no further action is required**. The fixes address issues reported through our [Vulnerability Reward Program](https://bughunters.google.com/about).  GKE Standard and GKE clusters users can optionally apply a similar hardening policy as described below. Technical details**Note:** The security boundary for GKE nodes is the single-tenant virtual machine, and as such the ability to access the node VM from pods is [not considered a security boundary for Autopilot](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview#security-boundaries). Nodes are not shared between clusters or customers. Any actor taking advantage of these issues must first be granted access to the cluster itself with at least permissions to schedule pods.Host access using third party policy exemptions In order to allow Google Cloud to offer full management of nodes, and a Pod-level SLA, GKE Autopilot restricts some highly privileged Kubernetes primitives to limit workloads from having low-level access to the node VM. To set this in context: GKE Standard presents full access to the underlying compute, Autopilot presents limited access, and Cloud Run presents no access.  Autopilot relaxes some of those restrictions for a [predefined list of third party tools](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/partner-devops-and-security-solutions-for-gke-autopilot) to allow customers to run those tools on Autopilot without modification. Using privileges to create pods with host path mounts, the researcher was able to run a privileged container in a pod that looked like one of these allowlisted third party tools to gain access to the host.  The ability to schedule pods in this way is expected on GKE Standard, but not on GKE Autopilot, as it bypassed the host-access restrictions used to enable the SLA described previously.  **This issue was fixed by tightening the third party allow-listing pod specification.** Privilege escalation from root-on-node In addition to the host access, the `stackdriver-metadata-agent-cluster-level` and the `metrics-server` pods were identified as highly privileged. After gaining root-level access to the node, these services could be used to gain further control over the cluster.  We have deprecated and removed the `stackdriver-metadata-agent` for both GKE Standard and Autopilot. This component is still in use on GKE on VMware and Google Distributed Cloud Virtual for Bare Metal.  As a system hardening measure to prevent this type of attack in the future, we'll apply an Autopilot constraint in an upcoming release that prevents updates to the service account of various objects in the `kube-system` namespace. We developed a [Gatekeeper policy](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library/tree/master/library/general/noupdateserviceaccount) for you to apply similar protection to GKE Standard clusters and GKE clusters to prevent privileged workload self-modification. This policy is applied automatically for Autopilot clusters. For instructions, refer to the following hardening guides:  * [GKE Standard](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#restrict_self_modify) * [GKE on VMware](/anthos/clusters/docs/on-prem/1.10/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#restrict_self_modify) * [Google Distributed Cloud Virtual for Bare Metal](/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/latest/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#restrict_self_modify) * **Update 2022-03-15:** [GKE on AWS](/anthos/clusters/docs/multi-cloud/aws/concepts/security#restrict_self_modify) * **Update 2022-03-15:** [GKE on Azure](/anthos/clusters/docs/multi-cloud/azure/concepts/security#restrict_self_modify)   ---  **Addition 2022-03-15:** Persistence using mutating webhooks Mutating webhooks were used in [the report](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/gke-autopilot-vulnerabilities/) to establish a privileged foothold in the cluster post-compromise. These are standard parts of the Kubernetes API created by cluster admins, and were made visible to administrators when Autopilot added support for customer-defined webhooks.   ---  Privileged service accounts in the default namespace Autopilot policy enforcers previously allowlisted two service accounts in the default namespace: `csi-attacher` and `otelsvc` to give the service accounts special privileges. An attacker with high privileges, including permissions to create `ClusterRoleBinding` objects and with access to create pods in the default namespace, could use these service account names to access those additional privileges. These services were moved under the `kube-system` namespace to get the protection of existing Autopilot policy. GKE Standard clusters and GKE clusters are unaffected. What should I do? All GKE Autopilot clusters have had their policies updated to remove the unintended host access and **no further action is required**.  Further policy hardening will be applied to Autopilot in the coming weeks as a secondary protection. **No action is required.**  GKE Standard clusters and GKE clusters are unaffected as users already have access to the host. As a system hardening measure, GKE Standard clusters and GKE clusters users can apply similar protection with a [Gatekeeper policy](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library/tree/master/library/general/noupdateserviceaccount) that prevents privileged workload self-modification. For instructions, refer to the following hardening guides:  * [GKE Standard](/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#restrict_self_modify) * [GKE on VMware](/anthos/clusters/docs/on-prem/1.10/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#restrict_self_modify) * [Google Distributed Cloud Virtual for Bare Metal](/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/latest/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#restrict_self_modify) * **Update 2022-03-15:** [GKE on AWS](/anthos/clusters/docs/multi-cloud/aws/concepts/security#restrict_self_modify) * **Update 2022-03-15:** [GKE on Azure](/anthos/clusters/docs/multi-cloud/azure/concepts/security#restrict_self_modify) | Low |

These CVE fixes have not been backported. You should upgrade to ASM 1.10 or above.**  GKE clusters running Istio-on-GKE should upgrade to a supported version with fix to the above vulnerabilities   * **If you're using Istio-on-GKE 1.6, upgrade to   v1.6.14-gke.8.** * **If you're using Istio-on-GKE 1.4.11, upgrade to   v1.4.11-gke.4.** * **If you're using Istio-on-GKE 1.4.10, upgrade to   v1.4.10-gke.23.** * **If you are using GKE 1.22 or higher, please use Istio GKE   1.4.10. Otherwise, use Istio-on-GKE 1.4.11.**  **Warning:** Istio-on-GKE is deprecated. *After **December 31, 2021**, the UI no longer supports this feature during the creation of new clusters. After **September 30, 2022**, Istio-on-GKE will no longer be supported in existing clusters. You can [migrate Istio on GKE to Anthos Service Mesh](/istio/docs/istio-on-gke/migrate-to-anthos-service-mesh) to continue using your service meshes. For more information, see the [migration FAQ](/istio/docs/istio-on-gke/migrate-to-anthos-service-mesh).* Envoy users managing their own Envoys or Istio should ensure that they are using Envoy release 1.21.1. Envoy users managing their own Envoys build the binaries from a source like GitHub and deploy them.What vulnerabilities are addressed by this patch?[CVE-2022-23606](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23606), [CVE-2022-21655](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21655), [CVE-2021-43826](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43826), [CVE-2021-43825](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43825), [CVE-2021-43824](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43824), [CVE-2022-21654](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21654), [CVE-2022-21657](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21657), and [CVE-2022-21656](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21656) | High |

cgroup: verify that source is a stringThe following sequence can be used to trigger a UAF:
int fscontext\_fd = fsopen("cgroup");
int fd\_null = open("/dev/null, O\_RDONLY);
int fsconfig(fscontext\_fd, FSCONFIG\_SET\_FD, "source", fd\_null);
close\_range(3, ~0U, 0);
The cgroup v1 specific fs parser expects a string for the "source"
parameter. However, it is perfectly legitimate to e.g. specify a file
descriptor for the "source" parameter. The fs parser doesn't know what
a filesystem allows there. So it's a bug to assume that "source" is
always of type fs\_value\_is\_string when it can reasonably also be
fs\_value\_is\_file.
This assumption in the cgroup code causes a UAF because struct
fs\_parameter uses a union for the actual value. Access to that union is
guarded by the param->type member. Since the cgroup paramter parser
didn't check param->type but unconditionally moved param->string into
fc->source a close on the fscontext\_fd would trigger a UAF during
put\_fs\_context() which frees fc->source thereby freeing the file stashed
in param->file causing a UAF during a close of the fd\_null.
Fix this by verifying that param->type is actually a string and report
an error if not.
In follow up patches I'll add a new generic helper that can be used here
and by other filesystems instead of this error-prone copy-pasta fix.
But fixing it in here first makes backporting a it to stable a lot
easier.

Security Fix(es):

* kernel: improper initialization of the "flags" member of the new pipe\_buffer (CVE-2022-0847)
* kernel: Use After Free in unix\_gc() which could result in a local privilege escalation (CVE-2021-0920)
* kernel: local privilege escalation by exploiting the fsconfig syscall parameter leads to container breakout (CVE-2021-4154)
* kernel: possible privileges escalation due to missing TLB flush (CVE-2022-0330)
* kernel: remote stack overflow via kernel panic on systems using TIPC may lead to DoS (CVE-2022-0435)
* kernel: cgroups v1 release\_agent feature may allow privilege escalation (CVE-2022-0492)
* kernel: failing usercopy allows for use-after-free exploitation (CVE-2022-22942)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

## Topic

An update for redhat-release-virtualization-host and redhat-virtualization-host is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.

Security Fix(es):

* kernel: improper initialization of the "flags" member of the new pipe\_buffer (CVE-2022-0847)
* kernel: Use After Free in unix\_gc() which could result in a local privilege escalation (CVE-2021-0920)
* kernel: local privilege escalation by exploiting the fsconfig syscall parameter leads to container breakout (CVE-2021-4154)
* kernel: possible privileges escalation due to missing TLB flush (CVE-2022-0330)
* kernel: remote stack overflow via kernel panic on systems using TIPC may lead to DoS (CVE-2022-0435)
* kernel: failing usercopy allows for use-after-free exploitation (CVE-2022-22942)
* cyrus-sasl: failure to properly escape SQL input allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands (CVE-2022-24407)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

[ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3846.pdf) - The
ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

[ONTAP 9 Encryption Power
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Security_and_data_encryption.pdf)

* When it comes to understanding the configuration and management details of NSE and NVE,
  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

* You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators.
  You can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

[DS-3898: NetApp Storage Encryption and NetApp Volume
Encryption](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3898.pdf) - When it comes to
encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what
encryption algorithm is in use, this is the resource for you!

Threat resources consist of guidance to address known threats through a
combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white

As a companion to the NetApp Solution for Ransomware, we have partnered with
Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration
