  "CVE-2021-4154": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A vulnerability was discovered in the Linux kernel that can lead to a privilege escalation on Container-Optimized OS nodes.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the cgroup v1 specific fs parser, which assumes that the 'source' parameter is always of type fs_value_is_string, but it can also be of type fs_value_is_file. This can lead to a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability during put_fs_context().",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a privilege escalation on Container-Optimized OS nodes.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local attacker with the ability to create a Pod and associate a `gitRepo` volume"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a Pod and associate a `gitRepo` volume or a user with the ability to exploit the fsconfig syscall parameter.  For GKE Autopilot clusters, the seccomp `Unconfined` profile or allow the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability was discovered in the Linux kernel that can lead to a privilege escalation on Container-Optimized OS nodes. GKE Standard and Autopilot clusters are impacted, except for clusters using GKE Sandbox. The vulnerability exists in Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc2"
