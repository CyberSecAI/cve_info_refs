Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4128:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a race condition when transitioning in and out of fullscreen mode in Firefox on macOS. During this transition, a graphics object (`NativeLayerCA`) was not properly protected, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability where a graphics object is accessed after it has been freed. This occurs due to a lack of proper synchronization or locking when modifying the `mSublayers` member of the `NativeLayerCA` object from different threads.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition that occurs during fullscreen mode transitions.
- **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free leads to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite critical memory areas.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Crash:** The primary impact is a potentially exploitable crash of the Firefox application.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The memory corruption could potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution, although the information does not confirm this definitively.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by transitioning in and out of fullscreen mode.
- The specific trigger is a race condition when modifying the graphics object during this transition, which is exposed during the execution of `dom/html/test/test_fullscreen-api-race.html`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the fullscreen transition within Firefox on macOS. This would most likely be achieved via malicious webpage.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability specifically affects Firefox on macOS. Other operating systems are not impacted.
- The vulnerability was fixed by implementing mutex locks to protect the `mSublayers` variable.

The provided bugzilla link ([Bug 1735852](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1735852)) provides additional context including:
- Crash signatures: `@ nsCocoaWindow::DoMakeFullScreen(bool, bool)` and related signatures.
- Thread stack traces of the crash, showing the involved functions and libraries.
- Confirmation that the issue was a regression introduced with bug 1653417.
- A fix was implemented by bug 1731956, which added a mutex lock and later by bug 1736446 which also added a mutex lock.
- The vulnerability was rated as "sec-high" severity.
