Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4358

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) WordPress plugin. This allowed attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into the plugin's settings fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which would then be stored in the database. When users accessed pages displaying these settings, the injected scripts would execute.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The plugin failed to properly sanitize user inputs, specifically in fields where integration scripts could be added (e.g., Matomo field). This lack of sanitization allowed for the injection of HTML and JavaScript code.
- Lack of Output Escaping: The plugin also failed to escape output in admin pages, allowing for the injected malicious scripts to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Redirection to Malicious Sites: Attackers successfully injected JavaScript code that redirected site visitors to a malicious site (`https://store.piterreceiver.ga`). This could lead to various malicious activities like phishing, malware distribution, or credential theft.
- Arbitrary Script Execution: The injected scripts could have performed other malicious actions, like stealing cookies, injecting iframes, modifying page content, or performing actions on behalf of logged-in users (if they happen to visit the vulnerable pages).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Plugin Settings Fields: The attack vector was through the input fields within the WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) plugin's settings page, where users could add code for integrations (e.g., Google Analytics, Matomo).
- Unauthenticated Access: The vulnerability was unauthenticated, meaning an attacker did not need to have any administrative or user credentials to inject the malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No authentication was required, meaning the attacker did not need any specific position or level of access to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needed to be able to send a crafted request to the WordPress server to inject the malicious scripts. This could be done via a browser or other means of sending HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild.
- The vulnerable versions included 3.1.23 and below.
- A new version (3.1.24) was released to fix the issue.
- Users were advised to check the integration scripts within their plugins for any unauthorized code and to temporarily deactivate integrations until the plugin was updated.
- The injected code was stored in the database, meaning that a database cleanup may have been necessary even after updating the plugin.
