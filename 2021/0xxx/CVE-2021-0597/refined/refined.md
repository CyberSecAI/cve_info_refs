Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0597:

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-0597 is an Information Disclosure (ID) vulnerability found in the System component of Android. It relates to how SIP profiles are handled in the voip service.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check for a broadcast intent related to SIP profiles. The commit message `Add permission for the broadcast intent with SIP profiles for security purpose.` suggests that previously, the intent was accessible without the appropriate permission.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is an insufficient access control. The broadcast intent for SIP profiles could be accessed by an unauthorized party (likely a malicious app), allowing for unauthorized access to SIP profile information.
*  **Impact:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information related to SIP profiles.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is local. A malicious application installed on the device could exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** A local malicious application needs to be installed on the device, requiring no special permissions other than those needed to receive broadcast intents.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by the commit `0e459673aa944d65989181b659c820504117ab51` which seems to implement the permission check.
*   The associated bug ID is A-176496502.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in AOSP versions 8.1, 9, 10, and 11 according to the Android Security Bulletin.

In summary, CVE-2021-0597 allows an attacker to potentially disclose sensitive information via an unprotected broadcast intent related to SIP profiles within the Android System component. The fix involves adding a permission check to secure the broadcast intent.
