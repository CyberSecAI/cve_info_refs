Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0935:

**Vulnerability Description**

The vulnerability is a race condition in the `hugetlb` subsystem of the Linux kernel, specifically during the assignment and writing of a value to `table->data`. This race can lead to a null pointer dereference, resulting in a kernel crash.

**Root Cause**

The root cause is a race condition that occurs between two threads:

1.  One thread calls `proc_sys_write`, which eventually leads to `hugetlb_sysctl_handler`, and where the `table->data` is assigned a temporary variable.
2.  Another thread calls `proc_doulongvec_minmax` which reads the value of `table->data` which might be uninitialized or invalid, and attempts to write to it.

This race can lead to a use-after-free scenario when the `table->data` pointer is accessed by `proc_doulongvec_minmax` after being freed or modified by another thread, resulting in a null pointer dereference and a kernel crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**

*   **Race Condition:** Concurrent access and modification of shared data (`table->data`) without proper synchronization.
*   **Use-After-Free:** Accessing a memory location after it has been freed or invalidated.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** Attempting to dereference a null pointer which leads to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Kernel Crash:** The primary impact is a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** The provided information indicates the vulnerability is classified as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP). Although it does not directly cause arbitrary code execution, a crash in the kernel could be leveraged in a complex exploit chain to achieve privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors**

*   The vulnerability is triggered via interaction with the `hugetlb` subsystem, specifically through the `proc_sys_write` and `proc_doulongvec_minmax` calls.
*   It requires a thread to write to the sysctl and another to read it, triggering the race.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.
*   **Kernel Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code paths in the kernel, likely involving specific system calls.

**Additional Notes**

*   The fix involves duplicating the `table` structure and only updating the duplicate. A helper function was also introduced to simplify the code.
*   The vulnerability was reported by syzbot and confirmed by a kernel crash with a NULL pointer dereference.
