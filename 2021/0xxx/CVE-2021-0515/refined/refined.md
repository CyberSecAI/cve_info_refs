Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0515:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue within the V8 JavaScript engine, specifically related to how it handles proxy auto-config (PAC) files, which are used to configure proxy settings on a network. It appears a file path change caused the existing blocklist to become ineffective and the incorrect file path to be used which was causing crashes. The fix was an update of the blocklist

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect file path:** A change in the location of the `api-arguments-inl.h` file caused the blocklist to not function as expected.
*   **V8 engine issue**: The V8 JavaScript engine within `chromium-libpac` had an underlying vulnerability that could be triggered through the processing of malicious PAC files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process by providing a specially crafted PAC file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted PAC file**: The primary attack vector involves delivering a malicious PAC file to a vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker**: The attacker can be remote and needs the capability to deliver or cause the processing of a malicious PAC file by the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes**

The provided information suggests the fix involves updating the blocklist to include the correct file path for `api-arguments-inl.h`.
The patch also upgrades the V8 engine to a version that addresses the underlying vulnerability.
This information also states that the issue was fixed as part of the 2021-07-05 security patch.
