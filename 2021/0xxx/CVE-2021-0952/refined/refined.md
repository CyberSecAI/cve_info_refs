{
  "CVE-2021-0952": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper filtering for system apps that can handle cropping photos. This allows non-system apps to potentially access and manipulate photo cropping functionalities that should be restricted to system apps.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient filtering of system apps",
      "Improper access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker with a malicious application",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device to exploit this vulnerability. No user interaction is needed to trigger this vulnerability after the app is installed."
