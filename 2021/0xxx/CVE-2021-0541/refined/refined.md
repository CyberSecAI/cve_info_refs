Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0541:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds (OOB) read within the NXP NFC HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) library. Specifically, the issue lies within the `nxp nfc hal library`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core vulnerability is an OOB read, meaning the code attempts to access memory outside the bounds of an allocated buffer or data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability is classified as an Information Disclosure vulnerability. This indicates that an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information residing in the memory region accessed via the out-of-bounds read.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves interaction with the NXP NFC HAL library. The specific method of triggering the out-of-bounds read is not detailed in the provided information, but the vulnerability exists within the code handling NFC functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the NFC functionality of the device. This likely involves proximity to the target device and the ability to initiate NFC operations that would trigger the vulnerable code within the NXP NFC HAL library.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided commit message `An info leak vuln caused by OOB read of nxp nfc hal library` further validates the information disclosure vulnerability caused by the out-of-bounds read in the `nxp nfc hal library`.
* The provided information does not contain any details about remote exploitation; therefore, the attacker likely requires physical proximity.
