Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0399:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
The provided content, specifically the Android Security Bulletin for March 2021, explicitly mentions CVE-2021-0399 under the "2021-03-05 security patch level vulnerability details" section, associated with the kernel component `xt_qtaguid`. This confirms the relevance of the provided content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in how `xt_qtaguid` handles tag entries. Specifically, a `sock_tag_entry` can be created but not added to any process's `pqd_entry` list. This entry should be removed from process's `pqd_entry->sock_tag_list` upon untagging. However, the tag entry is only removed from the `pqd_entry->sock_tag_list` if the process doing the untagging has opened `/dev/xt_qtaguid`. If the untagging process has not opened this device, the tag entry is not removed. The tag entry should always be deleted from its `pqd_entry` list if present, regardless if the untagging process has opened `/dev/xt_qtaguid`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incomplete Resource Cleanup:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to consistently remove tag entries from the process list during an untag operation. Specifically, the removal was conditional based on whether the process performing the untag operation had opened `/dev/xt_qtaguid`, instead of unconditionally deleting it if present in the list.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):**  The security bulletin categorizes this as an EoP vulnerability, indicating a local attacker could leverage this flaw to gain elevated privileges. The exact mechanism of privilege escalation is not explained in this content, but it implies that the inconsistent removal of tag entries could be exploited to gain access to resources or functionalities that the attacker would not normally have.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the device to exploit this.
- **File Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered when a process untags a socket and the corresponding tag entry is not properly removed from the process list. This indicates a crafted sequence of operations (tagging, untagging) that interacts with the affected code, potentially involving file operations related to `/dev/xt_qtaguid`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:**  The attacker requires local access to the Android device.
- **Ability to Interact with xt_qtaguid:** The attacker needs the ability to tag and untag sockets and interact with `/dev/xt_qtaguid`, or cause some process to do it under attacker's influence.
- **Privilege:** The attacker requires some level of privileges to perform operations that lead to the condition where tag entries remain unremoved from the process list (although the goal is to gain higher privileges).

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes links to the source code commits that fixed this vulnerability.
- The Android Security Bulletin specifies that devices with security patch levels of 2021-03-05 or later address this issue.
- The vulnerability is specific to the `xt_qtaguid` kernel module.

**Summary of extracted vulnerability information:**
- **Root cause:** Inconsistent removal of socket tag entries during untagging in `xt_qtaguid`.
- **Vulnerability:** Incomplete resource cleanup leading to EoP.
- **Impact:** Potential privilege escalation by a local attacker.
- **Attack vector:** Local attack involving a crafted sequence of socket tagging and untagging operations.
- **Required Capabilities:** Local access to the device, and ability to tag/untag sockets through `/dev/xt_qtaguid`.
