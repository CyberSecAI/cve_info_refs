Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0393:

**CVE-2021-0393**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `dnsmasq` component. It stems from an issue with how the `LiteralBuffer::ExpandBuffer` function operates, causing it to always grow, leading to the potential heap overflow. This is mentioned in the commit message of the fix: "LiteralBuffer::ExpandBuffer always grows".
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap overflow.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted transmission.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted transmissions to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was backported from a fix for CVE-2017-14491. This suggests the underlying issue has existed for some time, but was only recently addressed for this particular CVE.
*   The fix was manually tested with ASAN enabled builds of dnsmasq and confirmed that tethering still worked.
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple Android versions: 8.1, 9, 10 and 11
