  "CVE-2021-0989": {
    "description": "In the Telecomm service, there is a possible information disclosure due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
    "root_cause": "Missing permission check in Telecomm service.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Local information disclosure",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "No additional execution privileges needed",
       "No user interaction required"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The provided commit message indicates that the calling package is checked to be consistent with the calling UID.
