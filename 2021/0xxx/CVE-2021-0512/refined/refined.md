{
  "CVE-2021-0512": {
    "Root cause": "The HID subsystem allows a 'HID report field' to have a different number of 'values' and 'usages' when it is allocated. The size of the usage array is guaranteed to be at least as large as the values array, but it may be larger.",
    "Weaknesses": "Out-of-bounds write in __hidinput_change_resolution_multipliers() and an out-of-bounds read in hidinput_count_leds().",
    "Impact": "Potential out-of-bounds write and read.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is within the HID subsystem, potentially triggered by a malicious or crafted HID report.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to provide a crafted HID report with a different number of values and usages to trigger this vulnerability."
