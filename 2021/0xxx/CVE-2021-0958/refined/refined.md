Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0958:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in how older Keymaster (KM) implementations handle data consumption in certain block modes. Specifically, these older implementations do not consume data if insufficient data is present. However, `km_compat` update function assumes that the backend always consumes some data. This discrepancy can cause the system to get stuck in an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incomplete data handling in older KM implementations.
- Incorrect assumption in `km_compat` update that backend always consumes some data

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by causing an infinite loop, preventing normal operation of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the Keymaster component where specific block modes with insufficient data trigger the issue. The vulnerability appears to stem from an incorrect assumption about how much data is consumed, which can be exploited by sending specific input to the vulnerable component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to interact with Keymaster, specifically in a way that triggers the problematic data handling in `km_compat`. This suggests an ability to provide inputs to Keymaster operations, probably through an API.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided patch adds buffering to `km_compat` to handle unconsumed data, making it appear to the caller that data was consumed.
- The fix includes regression testing with `keystore2_km_compat_test` indicating that the issue is related to KeyStore 2.0 and KM compatibility.
