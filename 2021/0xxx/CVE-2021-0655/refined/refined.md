- **Root cause:** In the `mdlactl` driver, there is a memory corruption due to an incorrect bounds check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** Local. No user interaction is needed for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** System execution privileges are needed.
