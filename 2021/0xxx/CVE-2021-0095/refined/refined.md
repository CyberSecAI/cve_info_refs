Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0095:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "Improper initialization" within the firmware of some Intel processors. Specifically, it involves a flaw in how voltage settings are handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Initialization:**  The core weakness is that the firmware doesn't correctly initialize or validate voltage settings. This allows a user with sufficient privileges to manipulate these settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is the ability to cause a denial of service.  This likely means the system becomes unresponsive or unusable.
*   **Escalation of Privilege**: Although the Intel advisory lists it as a potential impact, the NetApp advisory states that this vulnerability could lead to the modification of data or DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploited via local access to the affected system.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with "high privileges" or "privileged user" on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the local system, not over a network.
*   **High Privileges:** The attacker must have high level privileges on the system to influence the settings.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **NetApp Products:** The NetApp advisory highlights that several of their products incorporate the vulnerable Intel processors.
*   **Affected NetApp Products:** Specifically NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) and NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node are listed as affected.
*   **Mitigation:** Intel recommends updating the system firmware to the latest version provided by the manufacturer. NetApp provides updates for their SolidFire & HCI Management Node products.
*   **NetApp Cloud Backup EOA:** NetApp has announced End of Availability for Cloud Backup and won't fix this vulnerability in that product.
*   **Intel Advisory:**  This vulnerability is part of a larger set of issues addressed in Intel advisory INTEL-SA-00463, which includes other CVEs related to firmware vulnerabilities in various Intel processors.
