Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-0094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper link resolution before file access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The Intel Driver and Support Assistant (DSA) does not properly handle link resolution before accessing files. This could lead to the software accessing unintended files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Escalation of privilege. An attacker could potentially gain higher privileges on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access. The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the local system where the vulnerable Intel DSA is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Authenticated user. The attacker needs to have an existing user account on the system.
*   Local access is required.
*   The attacker needs to trigger the improper link resolution vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Intel DSA versions prior to 20.11.50.9.
*   The CVSS score is 7.5, rated as HIGH severity.
* The CVSS vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H, which translates to:
    *   **AV:L** (Attack Vector: Local)
    *   **AC:H** (Attack Complexity: High)
    *   **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
    *  **UI:N** (User Interaction: None)
    *   **S:C** (Scope: Changed)
    *   **C:N** (Confidentiality Impact: None)
    *   **I:H** (Integrity Impact: High)
    *  **A:H** (Availability Impact: High)
