Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0504:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-0504

**Description:**
The CVE-2021-0504 vulnerability is an information disclosure vulnerability in the System component, specifically within the Bluetooth module. A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to local information disclosure.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the `avrc_pars_browse_rsp` function in the Bluetooth module. There appears to be a flaw related to the handling of packet sizes within this function, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read or other memory access issues that could expose sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability, allowing an attacker to potentially read memory that they should not have access to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Leakage:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for an attacker to gain access to sensitive information stored in memory. This could include various types of data depending on the memory region that is accessed.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local attacker:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker.
*   **Bluetooth:** The attack vector involves the Bluetooth subsystem. The specific method of crafting a malicious browse response is not detailed in the commit log.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to interact with the Bluetooth functionality of the targeted device.
* The attacker needs the capability to send a specially crafted transmission to trigger the vulnerability in the affected function `avrc_pars_browse_rsp`.

**Additional details:**
* The commit message `Check packet size in avrc_pars_browse_rsp` and bug ID `179162665` suggest a fix related to packet size handling in the mentioned function.
*   The commit also tags the fix as a security update.

**Affected versions:**
*   Android 11 is listed as affected.

In summary, CVE-2021-0504 is an information disclosure vulnerability within the Bluetooth module affecting Android 11. An attacker with local access can exploit a flaw in the `avrc_pars_browse_rsp` function by crafting a specific transmission to read sensitive data from memory.
