Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0536:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content includes a commit referencing CVE-2021-0536: "CVE-2021-0536 | [A-176756691](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/CertInstaller/%2B/2e6f670e6fd6ffa6065280e057b4a68dbc68a44e) | EoP | Moderate | 11"
   - This confirms that the content is related to CVE-2021-0536.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from an issue within the `wpa_supplicant_ctrl_iface_deinit()` function. This function, responsible for deinitializing the control interface, was not always executed when driver initialization failed.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  The primary vulnerability is a lack of proper resource cleanup during driver initialization failure. Specifically, if the driver initialization fails, references to the freed `wpa_s` instance are left behind in a corner case.
    - This results in a dangling pointer scenario, where the `wpa_supplicant_ctrl_iface_deinit()` function is not called, leading to potential use-after-free issues.
   - Additionally, pending messages for the interface are not flushed when the interface is not initialized correctly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the global interface gets deinitialized.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - The vulnerability is classified as an "Elevation of Privilege" (EoP).
   - If an attacker can trigger the scenario where driver initialization fails and then manipulate the control interface, they could potentially gain elevated privileges through use-after-free conditions.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector involves causing a failure during the initialization of the Wi-Fi driver, specifically by interfering with `per-interface control interface` initialization.
   - After triggering this failure, the attacker would need to interact with the control interface, which would attempt to use the freed wpa_s instance leading to exploitation.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - An attacker needs to have the ability to influence the Wi-Fi driver initialization process to force it to fail.
   - The attacker would also need some level of access to interact with the control interface.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Fix:** The fix ensures that `wpa_supplicant_ctrl_iface_deinit()` is called in all cases, even if the initialization fails, preventing the dangling pointer issue. Additionally, all pending messages related to that interface are flushed.
*   **Commit Details:** The commit message indicates the fix is related to bug ID 168314741 and the change was cherry-picked from commit `f3f8d3c8a89ff2b79a8eff5d2a3d94af70847b27`.

In summary, CVE-2021-0536 is an EoP vulnerability due to incomplete cleanup after a failed driver initialization, potentially leading to use-after-free scenarios. The fix involves ensuring proper deinitialization and message flushing in all cases.
