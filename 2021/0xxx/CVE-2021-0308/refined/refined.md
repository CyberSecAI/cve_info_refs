Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-0308:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `ReadLogicalParts` function in `basicmbr.cc` of the `gptfdisk` package.
*   The root cause is a missing bounds check when processing logical partitions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The lack of a bounds check allows for an out-of-bounds write, potentially overwriting memory outside the intended buffer.
*  **Integer underflow:** Processing a malformed partition table can cause an integer underflow when calculating the number of cyclic partitions. This can lead to writing to a negative index.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local privilege escalation:** The out-of-bounds write could allow a local attacker to escalate privileges.
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The vulnerability could also lead to a denial of service condition by crashing the `sgdisk` utility.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously formatted block device:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to insert a maliciously formatted block device, such as a USB stick or SD card, into the system. The `sgdisk` utility, when processing this device, would trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system, meaning the attacker needs to be able to insert the malicious device.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker requires the user to process the malicious device with the `sgdisk` utility

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `gptfdisk` prior to 1.0.6.
*   The vulnerability affects the `sgdisk` utility which is part of the `gptfdisk` package.
*   A fix for this vulnerability was included in the Android January 2021 Security Bulletin, with a patch level of 2021-01-01
*   The fix involves ensuring the number of partitions does not become negative.
*  The vulnerability is also present in gdisk package which was fixed in version 1.0.1-1+deb9u1 for Debian 9 stretch.
