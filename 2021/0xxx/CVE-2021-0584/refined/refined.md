Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0584:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content includes the commit message for a fix directly related to CVE-2021-0584, as indicated by the bug ID "179289794" which matches the A-number listed for CVE-2021-0584 in the Android Security Bulletin. The commit message also describes a vulnerability related to embedded buffers in binder objects, which aligns with the general description of vulnerabilities in libhwbinder.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how the kernel handles embedded buffers within binder objects when a child object is null. When `mObjects[child]` is null, the kernel doesn't update the embedded buffer's address, potentially leading to the use of an outdated address (`<a3>`).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect embedded buffer handling:** When a child binder object in `mObjects` is set to null, the kernel fails to update the corresponding embedded buffer address, leading to an inconsistency.
*   **Use of potentially incorrect pointer:** The kernel might continue to use the outdated buffer address which might now be pointing to an arbitrary memory location.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

By maliciously constructing `mObjects[child]` to be null, an attacker could prevent the kernel from correctly fixing the embedded buffer's address. This could result in an information leak or potentially lead to other memory corruption issues.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a malicious application or process crafting a binder object with a specific structure where `mObjects[child]` is intentionally set to null.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the capability to create and send binder objects to a vulnerable process or the kernel itself.
*   The attacker would need some knowledge of the structure of binder objects and the specific code paths that handle embedded buffers.
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the `mObjects` array, and be able to set some of its element to null.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content includes a diagram illustrating the structure of binder objects and embedded buffers.

The diagram represents the structure:

```
Offsets into Parcel's mData:
   .......|....<a1>....|......|....<a2>....|....
       ^      ^                ^        ^
       |      |                |        \-- 'buffer' field of structure
       |      |                \-- mObjects[child]
       |      \-- binder object structure 'buffer' field
       \-- mObjects[parent] (binder object structure)

 kernel-owned ro buffer @ address a1 ('parent' buffer)
       ....<a3>...........

  kernel-owned ro buffer @ address a2 ('child' buffer)
      (any random data)
```
- `a1` might be the address of hidl_vec object and `a2` might be the data pointer within hidl_vec.
- `a3` is the address of data buffer of the parent object which is equal to address of the data field inside hidl_vec object. This is what needs to be updated on deletion of the child object.
- The vulnerability is that, on setting `mObjects[child]` to `null`, kernel does not update `a3` which leads to use of outdated pointer.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided content also includes the fix commit message for another vulnerability. This commit is related to preventing an attack by removing the `setClassName()` method in Bluetooth app. It checks if calling and launching package names are equal to prevent class name from being set. This information is unrelated to CVE-2021-0584.

**Summary**

The provided content gives a detailed look into the root cause of CVE-2021-0584, how it's exploited, and the corresponding fix.
