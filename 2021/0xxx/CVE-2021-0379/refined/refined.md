{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds read error when processing side information in mp3 decoding.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The mp3dec component lacks sufficient checks when reading side information, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from memory if they can control the input stream.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted MP3 file to the affected media framework component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MP3 file to the vulnerable component for processing."
