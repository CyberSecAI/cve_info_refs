- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper permissions in the installer of the IntelÂ® Brand Verification Tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from incorrect permissions set during the installation of the tool. This allows a local authenticated user to potentially exploit the installer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to an escalation of privilege. This implies that a user with lower privileges can gain higher privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability, meaning that an attacker needs to have some level of access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user with local access to the system is required for the exploitation. The user must also be able to trigger the vulnerable part of the installer.
