Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-0090:

**Root Cause:**
- Uncontrolled search path element in Intel® Driver and Support Assistant (DSA)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The Intel DSA software, prior to version 20.11.50.9, does not properly control the search path used when accessing files or resources. This means that the application might load resources from an unexpected location, which is an uncontrolled search path element issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated local user to achieve privilege escalation. This means a user with low privileges can potentially gain higher level privileges (e.g., admin rights).
- The CVSS score indicates that there are potential risks to confidentiality, integrity and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H), although the scope is unchanged (S:U).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required. An attacker must have access to the affected machine.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must be an authenticated user on the local machine.
- The attacker must be able to leverage the uncontrolled search path element to load malicious resources.
- Since user interaction is required, the attacker would need to trick the user into performing some action that would trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Intel® DSA versions prior to 20.11.50.9.
- Intel recommends updating to version 20.11.50.9 or later to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The advisory mentions that Jimmy Bayne reported this specific vulnerability (CVE-2021-0090) to Intel.
