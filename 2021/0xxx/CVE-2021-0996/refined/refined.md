```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check that enforces the UID to package name mapping in `WifiServiceImpl#registerSuggestionConnectionStatusListener`. This allows an attacker to provide a fake package name that is not their own.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "UID to package name spoofing"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass intended restrictions or permissions by using a spoofed package name. This can lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to resources depending on what specific function is being exploited.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to be able to call `WifiServiceImpl#registerSuggestionConnectionStatusListener` with a fake package name.",
    "required_capabilities": "An application with access to the `WifiServiceImpl` API."
  }
