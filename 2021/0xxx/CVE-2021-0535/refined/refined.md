Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition in `wpa_supplicant` related to the deinitialization of the control interface. The `wpa_supplicant_ctrl_iface_deinit()` function was only executed if the per-interface control interface initialization had completed successfully. If driver initialization failed, this deinitialization function wouldn't be called leading to dangling references.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Dangling Pointer:** If the driver initialization failed, references to the freed `wpa_s` instance would remain in a corner case where control interface messages could still be queued.
- **Race Condition:** The issue exists due to the timing between the initialization and deinitialization processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):**  While the provided text doesn't go into specifics about how this would lead to EoP, the dangling pointers and potential queue manipulation could be used to gain elevated privileges, possibly through memory corruption.
- **Potential Use-After-Free:** The dangling pointers, if accessed after the `wpa_s` is freed, could lead to a use-after-free condition, potentially leading to crashes, memory corruption, and other unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could trigger a failure in driver initialization for a WiFi interface. This might be done through a malformed configuration or by forcing a specific failure scenario.
- After triggering the driver initialization failure, an attacker may need to send specific control interface messages to exploit the dangling references.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have some level of control or influence over the WiFi interface and its initialization process. This suggests a local attack surface and a need for some level of privilege to interact with the wpa_supplicant.
- The attacker would also need to craft control interface messages to trigger the vulnerability in the specific race condition window after driver initialization failure but before global interface deinitialization.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code change fixes this by always calling `wpa_supplicant_ctrl_iface_deinit()` to cancel any potential timeout loop for `wpas_ctrl_msg_queue_timeout` and the reference to the `wpa_s` pointer.
- It also flushes any pending messages from the global queue to ensure that no further processing occurs on the interface.

The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity according to the provided bulletin, but the information points to an elevation of privilege vulnerability, which generally could lead to greater impact
