Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0331:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-0331

**Description:**
A vulnerability exists in the Settings application that could allow for an elevation of privilege.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to how the Settings application handles overlays, specifically in the context of notification listener consent dialogs. Non-system overlays can appear over the notification listener consent dialog, which could potentially be exploited to gain unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of overlay windows in the context of a sensitive user consent dialog
- Privilege escalation through UI manipulation and bypassing user interaction requirements

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially mislead a user into granting notification access privileges to a malicious app by obscuring the real consent dialog with a crafted overlay.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to user notifications, which could contain sensitive data, and potentially escalate to further malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack vector via a malicious app that can draw overlay windows
- Requires the user to attempt to grant notification listener consent

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create an app that can draw overlay windows
- The attacker must get the user to interact with the malicious app when a notification consent dialog appears

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is to prevent non-system overlays from appearing over the notification listener consent dialog.
- The fix is specifically mentioned as a "RESTRICT AUTOMERGE". This implies it was critical to address.
