- **Root cause:** Integer overflow in the flv extractor leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses:** The flv extractor has a vulnerability due to an integer overflow. This issue is present in the media processing component.
- **Impact:** Local information disclosure, no additional execution privileges are needed, and user interaction is not needed for exploitation.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires a malicious flv file.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** Local access to the device to provide malicious flv file.
