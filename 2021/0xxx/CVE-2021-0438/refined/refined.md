{
  "CVE-2021-0438": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the improper use of the `NO_INPUT_CHANNEL` flag in Window Manager (WM). Prior to Android R, this flag allowed the creation of windows without an input channel. This could lead to a window being created that is unknown to the InputDispatcher. As a result, the `FLAG_OBSCURED` logic could be bypassed, allowing a window to overlay other windows without the overlaid window receiving notification.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper use of `NO_INPUT_CHANNEL` flag",
       "Bypass of `FLAG_OBSCURED` logic"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious application could create a window that overlays other windows without the overlaid window being notified, potentially leading to UI spoofing and other malicious behaviors.",
     "Attack vectors": "A malicious application could exploit this vulnerability by setting the `NO_INPUT_CHANNEL` flag when creating a window. This window can then overlay other windows without the user's knowledge and without the overlaid application being notified.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create windows with specific flags."
