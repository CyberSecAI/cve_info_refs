Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0377:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of patch data during streaming updates. Specifically, while the system verifies the manifest hash before applying operations and the hash of the entire payload after applying all operations, it does not validate patch data for each individual install operation. This lack of granular validation creates an opportunity for an attacker to introduce malicious patch data after the manifest verification but before the final payload hash check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insufficient Patch Data Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of validation of individual patch operations within a streaming update.
- **Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue:** There is a window between manifest verification and the final payload hash check where malicious patch data can be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The primary impact is the potential for an attacker to elevate their privileges by injecting malicious code into system updates. This could lead to complete compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious Patch Data Injection:** The attacker needs to provide malicious patch data after manifest verification but before the final hash check during a streaming update. This requires a man-in-the-middle position to modify data being delivered during update, or compromise the update server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or Compromised Update Server:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify the update data stream or to control the update server.
- **Understanding of Update Process:** The attacker must understand the streaming update process to be able to inject the malicious patch data at the right point during the update.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patch in the commit `1205ea684e81a6f14db7d5556f3eda2fd014b8d8` addresses the vulnerability by enabling validation of patch data for each install operation.
- This vulnerability affects devices running Android 11.
