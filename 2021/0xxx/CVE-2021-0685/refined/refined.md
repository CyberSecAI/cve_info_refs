{
  "CVE-2021-0685": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the presence of `ParsedIntentInfo.CREATOR`, which allows implicit `readParcelable` calls to invoke a Parcel operation with mismatched read/write data sizes, allowing an attacker to swap out data on a re-parcel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Mismatched read/write data sizes",
      "Implicit `readParcelable` calls",
      "Improper data handling during parcel operations"
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege by allowing an attacker to swap out data on a re-parcel.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious intent and parceling it to swap out data when re-parceling occurs.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create and send specially crafted intents and access parcelable data."
  }
