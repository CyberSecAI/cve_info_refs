- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in OMA DRM.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the OMA DRM component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to local escalation of privilege, potentially allowing an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited locally, without requiring any user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the device, and must be able to trigger the vulnerable code. System execution privileges are needed.
