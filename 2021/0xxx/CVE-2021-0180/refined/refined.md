- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled resource consumption in Intel HAXM software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper resource management, which can lead to a denial-of-service condition and potentially to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated local user can exploit the vulnerability, potentially leading to escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system running the vulnerable Intel HAXM software.
