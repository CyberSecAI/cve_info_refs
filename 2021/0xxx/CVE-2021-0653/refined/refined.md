Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0653:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how targeted broadcasts are sent within the Network Policy Management Service (NPMS). Specifically, when sending broadcasts with the `ACTION_SNOOZE_WARNING` action, which may contain sensitive information, the package name that should receive the broadcast was not explicitly set.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is that sensitive information within the `ACTION_SNOOZE_WARNING` broadcast could be exposed to other apps. 
- **Improper Broadcast Targeting:** The lack of explicit package name specification when sending the broadcast allows other applications to receive it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information:** Other apps could receive a broadcast intended for a specific app, potentially revealing sensitive user data or system information.
- **Privacy Violation:** This unauthorized access could lead to privacy violations.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious application or an attacker could create an intent filter to intercept broadcasts with action `ACTION_SNOOZE_WARNING`, thus receiving the broadcast intended for another app.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create an app:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious application.
- **Knowledge of the broadcast action:**  The attacker needs to know to listen to the specific `ACTION_SNOOZE_WARNING` broadcast.
- **No special permissions required:** This vulnerability does not require special or elevated permissions to exploit.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix ensures the package name of the intended receiver is explicitly set.
- The vulnerability is identified with bug ID `177931370`.
- The fix was manually tested.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 9, 10 and 11.
- It was also included in the Google Play system updates
