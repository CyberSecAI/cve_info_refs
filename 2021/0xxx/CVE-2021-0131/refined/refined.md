The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-0131.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Intel Security Library uses a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in an API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a weak PRNG.

**Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data due to the predictable nature of the PRNG.

**Attack vectors:** Network access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and would likely need to be able to interact with the vulnerable API, potentially requiring user interaction.
