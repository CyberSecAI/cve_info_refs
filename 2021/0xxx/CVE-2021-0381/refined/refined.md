Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the operating system handles URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) granting mechanism, specifically related to PendingIntents for low storage notifications. Malicious apps, particularly NotificationListeners, could hijack such intents. By relying on the OS URI granting mechanism, they could grant themselves access to sensitive URIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Intent Handling:** The OS was not properly enforcing restrictions on how PendingIntents, especially those used for low storage notifications, could be used.
-   **URI Granting Vulnerability:** The OS's URI granting mechanism was being exploited. Malicious apps could take advantage of this to gain unauthorized access to sensitive URIs.
-   **Notification Listener Abuse:** NotificationListeners were able to intercept and manipulate these intents, thereby bypassing intended security controls.
-  **Lack of Mutability Flag:** The PendingIntent was not marked as immutable, allowing malicious apps to modify it and hijack its functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Access to Sensitive URIs:** Successful exploitation could allow a malicious application to access sensitive data pointed to by URIs, potentially exposing user information, files or other sensitive resources.
-   **Hijacking of Intents:** Malicious applications could hijack intents meant for other parts of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious App:** An attacker would need to install a malicious app on the device, especially one with NotificationListener capabilities.
-   **Intent Hijacking:** The malicious app would hijack PendingIntents related to low storage notifications.
-   **URI Access:** The hijacked intents and OS's URI granting mechanism are used to grant the malicious app access to sensitive URIs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the user's device.
-   **Notification Listener Access (Potentially):** While not explicitly stated it seems a NotificationListener capability or similar is needed to intercept and manipulate the PendingIntent.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message indicates that the fix involves making the PendingIntent immutable. This prevents modification by other apps.
-  The fix also addresses an enforcement requirement for Android S, which mandates targeting apps to explicitly specify a mutability flag on PendingIntents.
- The issue is categorized as "ID" (Information Disclosure) with a "Moderate" severity.
- The vulnerability was identified with bug ID 153466381.
