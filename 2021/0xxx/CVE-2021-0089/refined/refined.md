Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2021-0089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a microarchitectural behavior in modern superscalar processors. These processors use sophisticated decoding and caching of the instruction stream for performance improvements.
- When self-modifying code updates occur, the changes might not take effect immediately due to caching.
- Some CPUs may speculatively decode and execute the stale instruction stream leading to type confusion in registers, and potentially data leaks

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Speculative Code Store Bypass (SCSB):** The core vulnerability is the speculative execution of stale instructions after a code modification. This can lead to type confusion and information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially infer the contents of arbitrary host memory, which may include memory assigned to other guests in a virtualized environment. This could lead to information leaks of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the execution of self-modifying code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the affected system and have the ability to modify code that would be executed speculatively. This can be achieved by running code in a virtual machine.
- Local access is required.
- No special user privileges required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects systems running all versions of Xen, but the vulnerability depends on the underlying CPU microarchitecture.
- Xen on ARM is believed not to be vulnerable due to the lack of runtime self-modifying code. However, Xen on x86, which does have runtime self-modifying code as part of emulation, is believed to be potentially vulnerable.
- Mitigation is possible by enabling Spectre v2 mitigations like retpoline or lfence.
- The vulnerability is also referred to as XSA-375 in the Xen Security Advisory.
- The vulnerability is associated with CVE-2021-26313 as well on AMD systems.
- Intel recommends process isolation, placing serializing operations or LFENCE operations between code generation and execution as mitigations.

**Mitigations:**
- Use `spec-ctrl=bti-thunk=retpoline` or `spec-ctrl=bti-thunk=lfence` to enable RETPOLINE or LFENCE mitigations if Spectre v2 support is compiled in.
- Ensure the SPECULATIVE_HARDEN_BRANCH hypervisor config option is enabled (4.13 and newer versions).
