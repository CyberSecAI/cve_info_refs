  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper UID/package name check in `WifiServiceImpl#registerSuggestionConnectionStatusListener`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows a caller to provide a fake package name which is not their own.",

  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious application calling the `WifiServiceImpl#registerSuggestionConnectionStatusListener` with a forged package name.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to call the vulnerable API, `WifiServiceImpl#registerSuggestionConnectionStatusListener`."
