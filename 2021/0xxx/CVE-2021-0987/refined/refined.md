Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `getNeighboringCellInfo` function in the Telephony service. The code was not properly checking the calling package's name before returning cell information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability. The lack of proper package name validation allows a malicious or unprivileged app to potentially obtain sensitive cell information (such as cell tower IDs and signal strengths).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Breach:** The impact is primarily a privacy breach, as a malicious app can access and potentially misuse the cell tower information to track a user's location or movements.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on an Android device can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an app installed on the target device.
- The app would need to call the vulnerable `getNeighboringCellInfo` function, which does not properly check the caller's package name, in order to access the sensitive cell information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves checking the package name of the calling app within the `getNeighboringCellInfo` function.
- The AOSP commit link ([https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Telephony/%2B/b55f63bb621582c00ff5378d06823357140fd9de](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Telephony/%2B/b55f63bb621582c00ff5378d06823357140fd9de)) confirms the fix, and the commit message specifies "Check PkgName in getNeighboringCellInfo".
- The provided commit hash from the second document is the same as in the security bulletin.
