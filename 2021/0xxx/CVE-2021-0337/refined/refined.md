{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in how URI permissions are handled when a file is deleted, renamed, or moved. If a file associated with URI permissions is manipulated (deleted, renamed, or moved), these permissions are not properly revoked, which could lead to privilege escalation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is the improper revocation of URI permissions upon file manipulation (deletion, renaming, moving). This can lead to an elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability because an application might retain access to resources it should no longer have access to.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious application could potentially retain access to file resources after the file has been moved, renamed, or deleted by leveraging the URI permissions. This could allow the malicious application to bypass intended access controls or gain unauthorized access to data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating files (deleting, renaming, or moving) that have associated URI permissions, and then exploiting the fact that these permissions are not revoked. A malicious application could perform these file manipulations, or rely on other actions or apps to move or rename files with associated URI permissions.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would require a malicious application installed on the target device. This malicious application would need to have some form of access or knowledge of files/resources that the system would grant via URI permissions. The attacker would need to be able to manipulate these files, either directly or indirectly through another action, to trigger the failure to revoke URI permissions."
