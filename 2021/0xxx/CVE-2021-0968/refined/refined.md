Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The provided content indicates a remote code execution vulnerability exists within the Bluetooth component of Android. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in `platform/system/bt`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This is a critical weakness, as it grants the attacker significant control over the affected device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. The code is executed within a privileged process, which indicates the attacker could potentially achieve system-level access.
- This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including data theft, malware installation, and complete device control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the device.
- The vulnerability exists within the Bluetooth component, likely meaning that exploitation occurs over a Bluetooth connection or through Bluetooth related data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious data/commands over Bluetooth to a vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to be in range of the targeted device's Bluetooth.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for this vulnerability is located in the AOSP repository, specifically in `platform/system/bt/%2B/fa98e7e86947b0035123b77cf7e1c0b969db71f6`.
