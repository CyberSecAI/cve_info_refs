{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mPlayPolicy can be freed twice due to a race condition.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Double free vulnerability due to a race condition.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A double free can lead to memory corruption, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through a race condition when the license request is made, likely involving the Play Policy service.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the race condition, which can occur quite often based on the description. The attacker would also need to be able to influence the state to trigger the double free."
