Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inefficient handling of ellipsized characters within the Android Framework. Instead of iterating over only necessary ranges for copying, the system was iterating through all ellipsized characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The inefficient iteration process can be exploited by a specially crafted file, potentially leading to a permanent denial of service. The processing of excessive ranges of ellipsized characters can consume excessive resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

* **Permanent Denial of Service:** A successful exploit can cause a permanent DoS condition on the affected device. This likely means the device will become unusable until some form of recovery is performed (e.g. factory reset).

**Attack Vectors:**

* **Specially crafted file:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted file that will cause the system to iterate over large ranges of ellipsized characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

* **Remote access:**  The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted file to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves improving the ellipsizing performance by only iterating over the necessary ranges of characters instead of all ellipsized characters, as stated in the commit message: `Improve ellipsized performance`
*   The vulnerability affects Android versions 8.1, 9, 10 and 11.
*   The provided source code commit `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/ed0c637a311d98426ff29cecd96aa429b53544dc` shows the patch for the vulnerability.
