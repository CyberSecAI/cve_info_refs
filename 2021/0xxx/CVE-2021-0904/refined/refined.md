- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An insecure permission setting in SRAMROM.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource. This allows a permission bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Local.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires System execution privileges. No user interaction is needed for exploitation.
