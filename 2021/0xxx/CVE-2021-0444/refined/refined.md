{
  "CVE-2021-0444": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Contacts application was returning intent data in `onActivityResult`, while the code only used the result code. This unintentionally exposed a potential URI permission grant attack vector.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Unnecessary intent data return",
       "Potential URI permission grant attack"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious application could potentially exploit this to gain unauthorized access to resources through the URI permission grant.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious application could initiate an intent to the Contacts app, receive the data in `onActivityResult`, and potentially exploit the granted URI permissions.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A malicious application installed on the device. The attacker needs to be able to start an activity in the Contacts application to trigger the vulnerability."
