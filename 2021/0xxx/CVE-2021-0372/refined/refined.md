Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0372:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of explicitly setting the mutable flag when creating a PendingIntent.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core issue is an improper handling of PendingIntents within the Android Settings application. Specifically, the absence of the `FLAG_MUTABLE` when creating PendingIntents can be exploited if the application that receives the Intent is not properly protected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially elevate privileges by modifying the intent received by the target application, leading to the execution of unauthorized actions or access to sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could craft a malicious application that targets the specific PendingIntent vulnerability in the Settings application. By intercepting or modifying the intent, an attacker might be able to gain elevated privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to either intercept or modify intents that are sent to the vulnerable application. This may involve tricking the user into installing a malicious application, having a privileged position on the device, or exploiting another vulnerability to inject malicious intents.

**Additional details:**
The provided text highlights the fix applied to the Android Settings application that explicitly adds the `FLAG_MUTABLE` when creating a PendingIntent, thereby addressing the vulnerability. The change ensures that the intent cannot be modified by a malicious receiver.

The vulnerability is categorized as "Elevation of Privilege (EoP)" with a moderate severity. The fix was applied to AOSP version 11.
