Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0596:

**CVE Description:** The provided text is a security bulletin that includes details for CVE-2021-0596. This CVE has a High severity rating and affects the System component.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The commit message states "Potential out of bound in phNfcInf_RecvMfResp." This indicates a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability in the NFC (Near Field Communication) component when processing a response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read/write:** The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `phNfcInf_RecvMfResp` function within the NFC component, where a response is being processed. An attacker can craft a response that could lead to an out-of-bounds read or write to memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The CVE is categorized as an ID (Information Disclosure) vulnerability. While the provided text does not specify exactly what information could be disclosed, out-of-bounds reads can leak sensitive data from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted file:** According to the bulletin, the vulnerability could be exploited by a "local malicious application." This indicates that an attacker would need to have a malicious application installed on the device.
- **NFC interaction**: The vulnerability lies in the NFC stack, suggesting the attack vector may be related to a specially crafted NFC data exchange or interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local malicious application:** An attacker needs a malicious application installed on the device to trigger the vulnerable code path in the NFC component.
- **NFC proximity**: The attacker may also need to be in NFC proximity with the target device to initiate a malicious NFC interaction.

**Additional Notes**
- The AOSP commit link is provided in the original text, which shows the code changes made to remediate this issue.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 8.1, 9, 10 and 11.
