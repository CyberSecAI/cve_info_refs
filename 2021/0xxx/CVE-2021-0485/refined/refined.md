Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0485:

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-0485 is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability in the Android Framework. It is related to how the system handles the minimum size when overriding Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode. The vulnerability could allow a local malicious application to bypass user interaction requirements.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper validation of the minimum size when overriding the PiP mode. Specifically, the absolute minimum size should be 48dp according to the fix details.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The system was not enforcing the correct minimum size when a PiP window is overridden. This lack of validation creates the vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious local application could potentially manipulate the PiP window to an unintended size bypassing user interaction requirements to gain additional permissions, which is an elevation of privilege.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a local malicious application. The attacker needs to have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have the ability to install an app on the target device.

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix ensures the absolute minimum size when overriding PiP is set to 48dp.
*   The commit message mentions: "Restrict the overridden min size for PiP. Per go/cdd-proposal-pip-size, the absolute minimum size when overriding should be 48dp."
*   The test case `atest PinnedStackTests#testEnterPipWithTinyMinimalSize` was updated to reflect the fix.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided text indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in AOSP version 11.
* The commit message specifies the change was cherry-picked from a previous commit (`2a18b15dfbb8c494ab58679c4aceb83da9683441`)

**CVE Severity:**

The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
