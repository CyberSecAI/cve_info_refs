Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0443:

**CVE-2021-0443**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to the `ScreenShotHelper` process not properly handling user switches. When a user switches profiles, the `ScreenShotHelper` process could remain active, potentially saving screenshots to the wrong user profile if a screenshot is triggered during a switch.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Incorrect user context:** The `ScreenShotHelper` does not properly close and reinitialize based on user switches. This can lead to the screenshot process being associated with the previous user profile when a new user logs in.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Because the screenshot is potentially saved under a different user context/profile, this results in an information disclosure vulnerability.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information in the form of screenshots belonging to a different user profile. This could lead to unintended disclosure of personal data, images, or other sensitive content.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   User switches profiles on an Android device.
    *   Trigger a screenshot while the user is switching.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *  The attacker must have access to the device and be able to switch profiles.
    *  The attacker must know how to trigger screenshots.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit message specifically mentions that the fix ensures the `ScreenShotHelper` service closes upon user switches, guaranteeing that screenshots are constructed using the correct user's context.
*   The fix involves having the `ScreenShotHelper` listen for user switch events and properly terminate its services to prevent issues where screenshots might be saved under the incorrect user profile.
*   This vulnerability is classified as "Information Disclosure" with a "High" severity.
