- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect bounds check in the audio DSP driver, which leads to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to local elevation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the audio DSP driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs system execution privileges to trigger the vulnerability. No user interaction is required for exploitation.
