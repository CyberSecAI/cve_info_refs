Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-0113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds write in the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write. This means the firmware is writing data to a memory location that is outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows for a potential denial of service. Additionally, there is a potential for limited data modification as indicated by CVSS vector having low impact to integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent access (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same physical or logical network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction (PR:N, UI:N). They need to be on the same network segment as the affected Intel Server Board M10JNP2SB.

**Affected Products:**
- IntelÂ® Server Board M10JNP2SB with BMC firmware versions prior to EFI BIOS 7215, BMC 8100.01.08.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory also includes information about other vulnerabilities affecting the same product (CVE-2021-0101, CVE-2021-0070, and CVE-2021-0097), but those are not related to CVE-2021-0113.
