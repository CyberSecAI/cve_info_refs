  "CVE-2021-0253": {
    "description": "On Juniper NFX product, a command injection is possible from management plan (CLI/Netconf) on jdmd process resulting on execution with full privileges on the host.",
    "root_cause": "Some user inputs from the management plane are concatenated into an XML and sent to the `jdmd` process. Upon XML reception, `jdmd` executes commands/scripts with these user inputs as parameters using `popen()`. The `popen()` function is vulnerable because it executes shell commands which make parameters interpretable.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command Injection: Unvalidated user inputs are used as script parameters by popen(), allowing attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands.",
      "Privilege Escalation: The jdmd process runs as root within a privileged container, leading to arbitrary command execution at the highest privilege level on the host.",
       "Insecure File System Mapping: Dangerous file system mapping with the host facilitates container escape."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the host, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "CLI: User input via CLI commands.",
      "Netconf: User input via Netconf XML messages."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with low privileges on the management plane (CLI/Netconf) can exploit this vulnerability."
