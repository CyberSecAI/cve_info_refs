Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0415:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the memory management driver.
- The root cause is a missing permission check when accessing the driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure. Due to the missing permission check, an attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information from the memory management driver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Information Disclosure:** The impact is local information disclosure, which means that an attacker could potentially obtain sensitive data from the device's memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the device, meaning the attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target device.
- **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability does not require any user interaction, meaning it can be triggered without user knowledge or consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target device, but no special privileges are required.

**Affected Chipsets:**
The following MediaTek chipsets are affected: MT6580, MT6582E, MT6582H, MT6582T, MT6582W, MT6582\_90, MT6589, MT6589TD, MT6592E, MT6592H, MT6592T, MT6592W, MT6592\_90, MT6595, MT6731, MT6732, MT6735, MT6737, MT6739, MT6750, MT6750S, MT6752, MT6753, MT6755, MT6755S, MT6757, MT6757C, MT6757CD, MT6757CH, MT6758, MT6761, MT6762, MT6763, MT6765, MT6768, MT6769, MT6771, MT6779, MT6785, MT6795, MT6797, MT6799, MT6833, MT6853, MT6853T, MT6873, MT6875, MT6877, MT6883, MT6885, MT6889, MT6891, MT6893
