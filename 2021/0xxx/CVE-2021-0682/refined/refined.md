{
  "CVE-2021-0682": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from not clearing SubscriptionInfo.mGroupUUID when a caller only has READ_PHONE_STATE permission and not READ_DEVICE_IDENTIFIERS permission.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Information Disclosure: Sensitive subscription group UUID information can be exposed to unauthorized callers with insufficient permissions.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission can gain access to subscription group UUID data, which they should not be able to access.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious application with the `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission can query subscription data to potentially obtain sensitive information that should be restricted to apps with the `READ_DEVICE_IDENTIFIERS` permission.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission. They also need to be able to make calls to the relevant API."
