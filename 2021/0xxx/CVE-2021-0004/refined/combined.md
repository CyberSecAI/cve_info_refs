Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-78090d2099
2022-01-20 08:31:04.549654
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : nodejs
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 14.18.3
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <http://nodejs.org/>
Summary : JavaScript runtime
Description :
Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime
for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that
makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive
real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

## 2022-01-10, Version 14.18.3 'Fermium' (LTS), @richardlau This is a security
release. ### Notable changes #### Improper handling of URI Subject Alternative
Names (Medium)(CVE-2021-44531) Accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name
(SAN) types, unless a PKI is specifically defined to use a particular SAN type,
can result in bypassing name-constrained intermediates. Node.js was accepting
URI SAN types, which PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when a
protocol allows URI SANs, Node.js did not match the URI correctly. Versions of
Node.js with the fix for this disable the URI SAN type when checking a
certificate against a hostname. This behavior can be reverted through the
`--security-revert` command-line option. More details will be available at
[CVE-2021-44531](<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44531>)
after publication. #### Certificate Verification Bypass via String Injection
(Medium)(CVE-2021-44532) Node.js converts SANs (Subject Alternative Names) to a
string format. It uses this string to check peer certificates against hostnames
when validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection
vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate chain,
allowing the bypass of these name constraints. Versions of Node.js with the fix
for this escape SANs containing the problematic characters in order to prevent
the injection. This behavior can be reverted through the `--security-revert`
command-line option. More details will be available at
[CVE-2021-44532](<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44532>)
after publication. #### Incorrect handling of certificate subject and issuer
fields (Medium)(CVE-2021-44533) Node.js did not handle multi-value Relative
Distinguished Names correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects
containing a single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted
as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject a
Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject verification.
Affected versions of Node.js do not accept multi-value Relative Distinguished
Names and are thus not vulnerable to such attacks themselves. However, third-
party code that uses node's ambiguous presentation of certificate subjects may
be vulnerable. More details will be available at
[CVE-2021-44533](<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44533>)
after publication. #### Prototype pollution via `console.table` properties
(Low)(CVE-2022-21824) Due to the formatting logic of the `console.table()`
function it was not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the
`properties` parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least
one property as the first parameter, which could be `\_\_proto\_\_`. The prototype
pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an empty string to be
assigned numerical keys of the object prototype. Versions of Node.js with the
fix for this use a null protoype for the object these properties are being
assigned to. More details will be available at
[CVE-2022-21824](<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21824>)
after publication. Thanks to Patrik Oldsberg (rugvip) for reporting this
vulnerability.
