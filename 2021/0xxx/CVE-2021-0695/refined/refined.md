  "CVE-2021-0695": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability in this section could enable a local malicious application to bypass operating system protections that isolate application data from other applications.",
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the handling of xt_qtaguid tags due to lack of proper locking, leading to inconsistent access to the tag list.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Race condition",
        "Improper synchronization",
        "Information disclosure via bypassing application data isolation"
    ],
    "impact": "A local malicious application could bypass operating system protections and gain unauthorized access to data that should be isolated from other applications.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Local malicious application"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to install and execute a malicious application on the device."
    ],
    "details": "The fix for this issue involves acquiring the sock_tag_list_lock while accessing the tag to avoid a race between getting the tag and freeing the tag. This ensures that access to the tag list is consistent and avoids the race condition. This vulnerability is present in the Android kernel.",
