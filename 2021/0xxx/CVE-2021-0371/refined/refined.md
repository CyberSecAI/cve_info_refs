Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an issue within the `nci_proc_rf_management_ntf` function related to NFC. The commit message "Prevent OOB read in nci_proc_rf_management_ntf" indicates an out-of-bounds read is the root cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:**  The core issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the specified function. This typically happens when a program tries to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The security bulletin classifies this as an "ID" (Information Disclosure) vulnerability. This implies that the out-of-bounds read could allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive information from system memory, which should not normally be accessible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The specific attack vector isn't detailed, but it involves the NFC component, specifically the `nci_proc_rf_management_ntf` function. The attacker would likely need to trigger this function in a way that causes it to read beyond its allocated buffer. This could involve crafted NFC communications or interactions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to interact with the NFC interface and cause the vulnerable function to be called to trigger the out-of-bounds read. This likely implies proximity to the target device with the ability to communicate via NFC.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided commit message explicitly mentions preventing the out-of-bounds read, which reinforces the root cause of the vulnerability.
*   The fix is located in the `platform/system/nfc` repository, and is included in AOSP version 11.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.

In summary, CVE-2021-0371 is an information disclosure vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read in an NFC function, requiring the ability to interact with the device via NFC.
