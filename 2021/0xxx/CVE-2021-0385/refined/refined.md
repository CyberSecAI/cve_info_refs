Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0385:

**CVE-2021-0385**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `ConnectToNetworkNotification` in the WiFi component doesn't properly restrict when the notification can be displayed. Specifically, it allows the notification to be displayed on the lock screen.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Authorization:** The system allows a notification related to connecting to a saved Wi-Fi network to be shown on the lock screen without the device being unlocked.
    *   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a device to connect to a saved WiFi network even when the device is locked.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can potentially trigger a connection to a saved Wi-Fi network without needing to unlock the device.
    *   This could be leveraged to force a device to connect to a malicious Wi-Fi network saved on the device.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to somehow trigger the display of the `ConnectToNetworkNotification` when the device is locked.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the target device save a Wi-Fi network to connect to.
    *   The attacker has to be in a position where they can trigger the display of the `ConnectToNetworkNotification`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit log from `android.googlesource.com` clarifies that the fix involves disallowing the `ConnectToNetworkNotification` from appearing on the lock screen.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a Moderate severity Elevation of Privilege (EoP).

In summary, CVE-2021-0385 is an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability where a notification related to connecting to a saved WiFi network could be shown on the lock screen and force the device to connect to it even when the device is locked. The fix prevents the notification from displaying on the lock screen.
