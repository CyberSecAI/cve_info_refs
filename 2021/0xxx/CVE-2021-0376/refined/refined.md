  "CVE-2021-0376": {
    "Description": "The provided text discusses changes related to URI permission handling in MediaProvider. It addresses a scenario where apps could crash when attaching image files due to denied URI permissions, specifically for content URIs without an ID, in the MediaProvider. The fix allows URI grants on content URIs without an ID, if not prefix grants.  It also includes a change to enable dynamic permissions based on MediaProvider version.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect handling of content URI permissions in MediaProvider, specifically for URIs that do not correspond to a specific database row ID. This caused apps to crash when permission was denied.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient permission checks for content URIs without explicit IDs in MediaProvider.",
      "Inconsistent permission handling between different types of URI grants (prefix vs. non-prefix)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Applications could crash when attempting to attach image files due to denied URI permissions.",
    "Attack vectors": "An application requesting URI grants for content URIs without IDs, particularly when attempting actions like attaching image files.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would need to be an app requesting access to content URIs in the MediaProvider, specifically those without a row ID."
