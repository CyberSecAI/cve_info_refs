Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0923:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-0923

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue related to internal permissions handling when an owner changes. The commit message for the fix states, "Revoke internal permissions upon owner change. Similar to runtime permissions." This implies that during an owner change within the system, internal permissions were not being revoked, potentially leading to an escalation of privilege.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of internal permissions during owner changes.
- Failure to revoke permissions, which can lead to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege (EoP): A local attacker could potentially gain access to additional permissions without requiring user interaction.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation: The attacker needs to have local access to the device.
- Owner change: The vulnerability is triggered when the owner of a component or resource changes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to trigger an owner change on the Android device.
- They must have a local presence on the device as this is not a remote attack vector.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
- This issue is addressed in AOSP version 12.
- The provided commit message indicates the fix revokes internal permissions similar to runtime permissions, suggesting a common vulnerability pattern in permission management.
- The commit message also includes the bug ID A-195338390, which is consistent with the CVE record.

The provided information from the code commit clarifies the vulnerability by stating that internal permissions are not properly revoked when an "owner" of a resource or component changes. It also indicates this was an oversight, as it should behave similarly to runtime permission changes.
