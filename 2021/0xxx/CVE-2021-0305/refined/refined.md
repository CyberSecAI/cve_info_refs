Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way click events were handled by `SwitchPreference` elements within the Android Settings app, particularly in the "Special app access" section. When an overlaying view was present, the click events were incorrectly passed to the `SwitchPreference` instead of the intended toggle widget. This allowed a malicious overlay app to potentially enable or disable settings without the user's direct interaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Tapjacking/UI Redressing**: The primary vulnerability is a form of tapjacking where an attacker's overlay view can intercept user clicks and redirect them to the underlying toggle element in settings.
*   **Incorrect Event Handling**: The `SwitchPreference` was incorrectly handling the click event rather than the underlying toggle widget which could have prevented this attack, even with the overlay.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A malicious application could exploit this by creating an overlay that covers the toggle switches within the "Special app access" section of settings, allowing them to gain access to additional permissions and potentially enable/disable settings that the user would normally not grant or revoke.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Overlay App:** An attacker would need to create a malicious application that can draw an overlay on top of other applications.
*   **User Interaction:** The user would need to launch the malicious application and then navigate to the "Special app access" section of the settings app while the malicious overlay is active. The user will think they are interacting with the overlay, but the clicks will be passed to the settings underneath.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create an Android application**: The attacker must be able to develop and deploy a malicious Android application.
*   **Overlay Permission**: The malicious app requires the ability to draw overlays on top of other apps.
*   **User Action:** The user must launch the malicious application and then navigate to the vulnerable settings area.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves enabling the `filterTouchesWhenObscured` attribute on all `SwitchPreference` elements within the "Special app access" section of settings. This attribute prevents the view from receiving touch events when it's obscured by another view. This attribute is also applied throughout the permission controller.
*   The provided test steps involve creating an overlay app, launching the settings app, navigating to the special app access page, and observing if the toggle can be switched when the overlay is present, showcasing how the issue manifests.
*   The commits also reference bug #155287782, which seems to be related to permission controller in package installer.
* The vulnerability is classified as EoP (Elevation of Privilege), with a severity of High.
