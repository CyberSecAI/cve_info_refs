- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a possible memory corruption caused by uninitialized data within the display driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119). Specifically, the driver uses uninitialized data, which leads to potential memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to local elevation of privilege, potentially granting the attacker system execution privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. The vulnerability can be triggered through the display driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a local position on the device. System execution privileges are required to exploit this issue.
