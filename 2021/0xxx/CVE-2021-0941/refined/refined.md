Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0941:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `__bpf_skb_max_len()` function within the kernel's BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem. This function checks the maximum length of an SKB (socket buffer) against the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) of the current network device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect MTU check**: The `__bpf_skb_max_len()` function limits the size of the SKB based on the MTU of the current network device. However, in cases of redirects, it uses the wrong network device to fetch the MTU, which is incorrect for packet processing through BPF programs. This limitation is problematic because BPF programs can grow the packet size, and the function should not restrict the packet size to the current MTU.
- **Inadequate size limit**: The function uses the MTU to limit the size, which is not the correct approach when the packet size is being modified by BPF programs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** By manipulating packet sizes using BPF helpers, an attacker could potentially cause memory corruption or other unexpected behaviors in the kernel. Although the provided patch note indicates that exceeding 8KB was not possible, larger frames can cause NIC reset (although not crashing). This could lead to local privilege escalation if exploited maliciously.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly stated in the provided content, incorrect handling of packet sizes and buffer allocation can cause a denial of service condition by triggering memory exhaustion or other error conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **BPF Programs:** An attacker would need to load a crafted BPF program that uses BPF helpers to manipulate/increase the size of SKBs to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to load BPF Programs:** The attacker must have the ability to load and execute BPF programs within the affected system. This often requires root privileges or specific capabilities.
- **Knowledge of BPF API:** The attacker would need a good understanding of BPF programming to create a suitable malicious program.

**Additional details from the commit:**
-   The commit message notes that multiple BPF helpers can manipulate/increase the size of an SKB.
-   The patch removes the MTU check in `__bpf_skb_max_len()` and instead keeps a sanity check with a max limit of `SKB_MAX_ALLOC` (16KB), with the real size limitation located elsewhere in the system.
-   The commit references testing that showed that the SKB expansion is limited by `KMALLOC_MAX_CACHE_SIZE` which is 8192 for SLUB allocator (when PAGE_SIZE is 4096).
