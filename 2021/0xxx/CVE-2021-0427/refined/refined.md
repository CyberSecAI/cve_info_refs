    "description": "The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of 2021-04-05 or later address all of these issues. The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in the System component that could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",

      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious application could potentially manipulate the size of mValues in LogEvent to trigger an integer overflow during index storage, possibly leading to out-of-bounds writes."
