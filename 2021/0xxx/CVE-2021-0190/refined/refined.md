Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an uncaught exception within the BIOS firmware of certain Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncaught exception: The BIOS firmware does not properly handle exceptions, leading to a potential exploitable state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of Privilege: A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to gain elevated privileges on the system.
- The NetApp advisory indicates potential impacts of sensitive information disclosure, data modification, or denial of service (DoS), which may result from exploitation of this and related vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have existing access to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Privileged User: The attacker must already possess privileged access to the system to trigger the vulnerability. This means the vulnerability is not directly exploitable by an unprivileged user.

**Additional Details:**
- The Intel advisory (INTEL-SA-00601) groups this CVE with other BIOS vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability affects a range of Intel processors, including some Xeon, Core, and Pentium/Celeron families.
- The CVSS v3.1 vector is AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating local attack vector, low attack complexity, high privileges required, no user interaction, scope change, and high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- NetApp has confirmed that none of their products are affected, although they incorporate Intel Technology that is vulnerable.
