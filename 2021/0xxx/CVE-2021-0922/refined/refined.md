Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0922:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- When sending broadcasts with the action `ACTION_SNOOZE_WARNING` in the Notification Manager Service (NMS), which may contain sensitive information, the package name of the intended recipient wasn't always explicitly set.
- The system used `getPackagesForUid` to determine the recipients. This could return packages randomly, and `enforceCrossUserOrProfilePermission` would fail for packages that did not explicitly hold the permission `INTERACT_ACROSS_PROFILES`, even if they shared the same UID as another package which did hold the permission.
- This was due to permission checks being done per package instead of per UID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Permission Enforcement:** The permission check for receiving the broadcast was performed on a per-package basis rather than per UID, potentially leading to unintended recipients receiving sensitive information.
- **Information Disclosure:** The broadcasts may contain sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** An attacker could potentially receive broadcasts containing sensitive information that were not intended for them.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious application could potentially intercept sensitive broadcasts meant for another application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- A malicious application needs to be installed on the same device to intercept the broadcasts.
- The malicious application should be on the same user ID as a package that receives `ACTION_SNOOZE_WARNING` broadcasts and not hold the `INTERACT_ACROSS_PROFILES` permission explicitly.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves explicitly setting the package name that should receive the broadcast to prevent other apps on the same user ID from receiving the broadcast when they do not have the required permission.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Elevation of Privilege" (EoP), though it primarily results in an information disclosure.
