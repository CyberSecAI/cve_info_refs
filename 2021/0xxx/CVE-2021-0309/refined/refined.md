CVE-2021-0309
```
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from improper handling of calling UIDs when granting credentials within the Android framework. Specifically, the `Activity.grantCredentials` method can be used in two cases: when the calling UID matches the UID of the grantee or when the calling UID is system UID and `notifyAuthFailure=true`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect permission checks or logic flaws when granting credentials.
- The vulnerability allows bypassing intended restrictions when granting credentials, potentially allowing privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform actions they are not supposed to, leading to elevation of privilege.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious app could attempt to call the Activity.grantCredentials method with an unexpected calling UID and exploit the vulnerability to elevate its privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to make calls to the `Activity.grantCredentials` method and manipulate the calling UID.
