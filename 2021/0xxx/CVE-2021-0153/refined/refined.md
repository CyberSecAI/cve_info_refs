Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-0153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an "Out-of-bounds write" in the BIOS firmware of some Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability is present within the BIOS firmware.
*   Specifically, it's due to an out-of-bounds write, which means the software is attempting to write data outside the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to an "escalation of privilege."
*   This means an attacker with lower-level privileges could gain higher-level privileges, potentially enabling them to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive information, or compromise system integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local access. This means the attacker must have some form of local access to the affected system.
*   The attack is carried out via the BIOS firmware of the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires local access to the system.
*   They also need "privileged" access, which is described as "high" (PR:H) in the CVSS vector for the intel document and as "low" (PR:L) in the CVSS vector in the NetApp document. This discrepancy in required access may come from the different ways to trigger the vulnerability and should be further investigated.

**Additional Details from Intel Document:**

*   The Intel document provides a more detailed description, clarifying that the out-of-bounds write is in the BIOS firmware.
*   Intel assigns a CVSS base score of 8.2 with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H` for this vulnerability.

**Additional Details from NetApp Document:**
* NetApp lists the CVSS base score of 7.8 with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
*  NetApp confirms that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).
* NetApp states that no workarounds are available at this time and software fixes will be made available through the NetApp Support website in the Software Download section.

**Affected Products:**
* The Intel document lists a wide array of Intel processors from different generations, including but not limited to:
    * Intel Xeon Scalable Processors
    * Intel Core Processors
    * Intel Pentium and Celeron Processors
    * Intel Xeon Processor W and E Families
* The NetApp document states that no products are affected by this vulnerability. This does not seem correct based on the intel document and should be further investigated.

In summary, CVE-2021-0153 is a high-severity vulnerability stemming from an out-of-bounds write in the BIOS firmware. An attacker with local, privileged access could exploit this to gain elevated privileges on the affected system, potentially causing significant harm.
