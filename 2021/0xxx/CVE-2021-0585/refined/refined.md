> Bug: 184963385

The Android Security Bulletin for July 2021 confirms that CVE-2021-0585 is related to a vulnerability in the `system/libfmq` component. The description in the bulletin is:

>The most severe vulnerability in this section could enable a local malicious application to bypass user interaction requirements in order to gain access to additional permissions.

The commit message confirms the vulnerability by describing a fix that prevents reads and writes when the pointers used for read or write operations are misaligned.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation or checks when using pointers for read or write operations. Specifically, the code did not verify if these pointers were correctly aligned, allowing misaligned pointers to be used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Alignment Checks:** The primary weakness is the absence of checks to ensure that pointers used for read/write operations are correctly aligned. This lack of validation could lead to memory corruption.
*   **Misaligned Memory Access**: The code allows read or write operations to proceed even when one of the read or write pointers are misaligned, which can lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The security bulletin states that this vulnerability could allow a local malicious application to bypass user interaction requirements in order to gain access to additional permissions.
*   **Memory Corruption:** If exploited, a misaligned memory access could lead to memory corruption, which could result in further exploitable conditions.
*   **Arbitrary code execution**: In severe cases, memory corruption could enable arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** A local attacker could craft a malicious application designed to trigger the vulnerability by supplying misaligned pointers to the affected component.
*   **Specially Crafted File**: The security bulletin mentions that a "specially crafted file" could be used. This may mean that a file containing misaligned data could also cause the misaligned memory access to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target device, typically through a malicious application installed on the device.
*  **Privileges:**  A local malicious application would need appropriate privileges to interact with the vulnerable component.

**Additional Notes:**
The commit message from `android.googlesource.com_99dadc18_20250115_224512.html` provides additional detail about the fix:

>Do not allow reads or writes when one of the read or write pointers are misaligned.

This indicates that the fix involves adding checks to ensure the read/write pointers are correctly aligned, preventing the use of misaligned pointers.

The content from  `android.googlesource.com_36253e60_20250115_224512.html`  is unrelated to CVE-2021-0585 as it involves the removal of an unused intent in NiNotification and is associated with bug 154319182.

**Summary**
CVE-2021-0585 is a vulnerability due to missing alignment checks within `system/libfmq`. A local attacker could craft a malicious application to exploit the vulnerability which could lead to elevation of privilege by bypassing user interaction requirements and gaining additional permissions. The patch prevents read and write operations when the pointers involved are misaligned.
