    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of backup and restore operations for /data/apex/active, leading to potential data corruption and issues with device functionality after restore.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
         "Incorrect conditional logic"
      ],
      "impact": "The issue could lead to data corruption when restoring apex backups on devices that support FS checkpointing, potentially causing device instability or unexpected behavior.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local access to the device with the ability to perform backups and restores",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs local access to the device to trigger backup and restore functionality",
        "additional_details": "The fix ensures that backups of /data/apex/active are not restored on devices with FS checkpointing, which mitigates potential corruption and functionality issues."
