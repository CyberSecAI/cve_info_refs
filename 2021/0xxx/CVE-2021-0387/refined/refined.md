Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from returning a reference to an object in `FindQuotaDeviceForUuid` that could be destroyed after it is returned.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Use-after-free: The code returns a reference to an object, and if that object is destroyed before the reference is used, it leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Elevation of Privilege (EoP): The vulnerability is classified as EoP which means successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain higher privileges than intended on the system. The severity is considered moderate.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is located in the framework layer, so a malicious application or process can potentially trigger the use-after-free.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need the ability to execute code on the device and manipulate the context in which `FindQuotaDeviceForUuid` is called.
- It is not clear whether this vulnerability can be triggered remotely, but it is highly likely the attacker will need a malicious application installed on the system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is fixed by not returning the reference to an object which could be destroyed.
- The fix for this issue is included in the 2021-03-05 security patch level for Pixel devices.
- The affected component is the native framework.
