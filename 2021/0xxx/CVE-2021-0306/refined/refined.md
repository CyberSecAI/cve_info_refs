Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0306:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how permissions are handled during non-runtime to runtime upgrades. Specifically, permissions were not being properly revoked when their owners changed or when permission levels were upgraded during the transition from non-runtime to runtime.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Permission Revocation:** Permissions granted in a non-runtime context were not being revoked when the system transitioned to runtime, or when the owning entity of those permissions changed.
*   **Permission Escalation:** An attacker could potentially leverage this to bypass permission checks by exploiting the permission handling differences between non-runtime and runtime.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** An attacker could potentially gain higher-level access or permissions than intended by exploiting this vulnerability. The Android Security Bulletin classifies this as a "High" severity EoP.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a transition from a non-runtime state to runtime, specifically related to permission handling during such upgrades. This could potentially be triggered by system updates or changes in app ownership.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to influence the system's state during the non-runtime to runtime transition. Specifically, the attacker needs to change permission owners or trigger permission level upgrades to exploit the lack of revocation of permissions.

**Additional Notes from the Provided Content:**

*   The fix involves revoking permissions when permission ownership changes or when a permission level is upgraded during the transition from non-runtime to runtime.
*   The vulnerability is present in Android versions 8.0, 8.1, 9, 10, and 11.
*   The provided code commits show the fixes are related to revoking permissions on state changes.
