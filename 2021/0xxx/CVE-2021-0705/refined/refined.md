Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from the ability of applications to bypass Blocked App List (BAL) and Background-Foreground (BG-FG) restrictions.
*   Apps were able to retrieve their own notifications and use the associated Pending Intents (PI) which were allowlisted for specific operations. This allowed bypassing the intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Restrictions:** The primary weakness is the ability of applications to circumvent BAL and BG-FG restrictions.
*   **Unrestricted Access via Notifications:** The system allowed apps to retrieve their own notifications and use their Pending Intents, which were not properly restricted to prevent abuse.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By bypassing these restrictions, a malicious application could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process and gain access to additional permissions (EoP - Elevation of Privilege)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device could exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Notification Manipulation:** The attack involves retrieving the app's own notifications and using their associated Pending Intents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
*   **Basic Android knowledge**: The attacker needs to be able to retrieve their own notifications and use the associated Pending Intents.

**Mitigation:**
* The fix involves stripping the token that granted the ability to bypass restrictions from notifications returned via `NM.getActiveNotifications()`. Notifications returned via notification listener APIs still contain the token.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text is a commit log that describes the fix for the vulnerability, not the vulnerability itself.
*   The CVE description indicates this is an EoP vulnerability. The commit message does not clarify the exact scope of what additional permissions could be obtained, nor which privileged process would be affected. The security bulletin associated with this CVE also indicates this is an EoP vulnerability and a local malicious application can execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
*   The fix was cherry-picked from other commits, suggesting this was an important issue to address.
