Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0433:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue where non-system overlays could potentially display over the CDM (Content Decryption Module) UI. This is problematic because CDM handles sensitive user consent UI, and non-system overlays should not be able to interfere with it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent overlay policy: The core weakness is that non-system overlays were not properly restricted from appearing on top of CDM UI. This could be leveraged by a malicious application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The primary risk was that a malicious app could potentially display an overlay on top of CDM UI when it is displayed.
- This could be used to trick users into giving consent or interact with the CDM UI in a way that the user does not intend to.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious 3rd-party application with the ability to create a visible overlay could attempt to overlay this on top of CDM UI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have an application installed on the device, that has the ability to create and display overlays on the screen.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves ensuring that CDM has the same overlay policy as permission UI, which restricts non-system overlays from appearing on top of it.
- The provided git commit message includes a test case that uses a 3rd party overlay to ensure it disappears when CDM is shown
