Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `ParsedIntentInfo` is handled, allowing for implicit `readParcelable()` calls to invoke a Parcel operation with mismatched read/write data sizes. This can lead to data swapping during a re-parceling process. Specifically, the `ParsedIntentInfo` class's existence allows implicit `readParcelable` calls to invoke a Parcel operation with mismatched read/write data sizes. This leads to a situation where an attacker can potentially swap out the data on a re-parcel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Mismatched data sizes:** The core weakness is that `readParcelable()` calls can be made on a Parcel without proper size validation.
*   **Data swapping:** The ability to swap out data on a re-parcel is a key vulnerability that could allow for arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.
*   **Implicit parcel operations:**  Implicit calls to parcel operations create an attack surface where data may not be handled as expected, resulting in unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** An attacker could potentially manipulate data during the parceling process to gain unauthorized access or permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious `Parcel` that, when processed, would cause mismatched read/write data sizes, leading to data swapping and, eventually, an elevation of privilege.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the data being parceled.
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to cause the vulnerable `readParcelable()` call to occur and thus cause the data swapping.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves removing the `ParsedIntentInfo CREATOR`, as internal classes now use `writeIntentInfoToParcel()`, which mitigates the vulnerability.
*   The commit message indicates that this is a cherry-picked fix, suggesting that the issue was addressed in a previous commit and then applied to affected branches.
*   The associated test, `com.android.server.pm.test.parsing.parcelling`, is a unit test.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-0688 is an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability caused by improper handling of data sizes during parceling. A malicious attacker could exploit this vulnerability to potentially swap out data during a re-parcel operation and gain elevated privileges. The fix involves removing the problematic `CREATOR` to ensure that the data is handled properly during parceling using a dedicated method.
