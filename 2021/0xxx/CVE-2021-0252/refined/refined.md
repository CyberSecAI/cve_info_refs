The content is related to CVE-2021-0252.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A command injection vulnerability exists in the `file_type_checker.py` python script due to the use of `subprocess.check_output()` with `shell=True` and unsanitized user-controlled input. The script is called by the `jdmd` process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Command Injection (CWE-77)
    - Use of `subprocess.check_output()` with `shell=True`
    - Lack of input sanitization
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the host. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability can be triggered from the CLI by providing malicious file paths when instantiating a virtual network function (VNF) or adding storage to a VNF.
    - It's suspected that the vulnerability could also be triggered through a netconf client, although this was not tested.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs the ability to use the Junos CLI, which would typically require some level of authorized access to the device. They need to be able to configure VNFs or add storage to them.
    - The attacker must be able to inject commands by crafting specific file paths.
