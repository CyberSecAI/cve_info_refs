Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0471:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An integer overflow can occur when calculating the size of the source buffer during decryption. This bypasses the intended size check, allowing the source pointer to potentially point outside the bounds of the source buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- Insufficient bounds checking on the source pointer during decryption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential information disclosure. An attacker could potentially leak arbitrary memory content by having the source pointer read outside the bounds of its intended buffer, which is then copied to the destination pointer.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered during the decryption process of media data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input data that will be decrypted, such that the integer overflow occurs. This likely involves manipulating media data.
- The attacker would need to be in a position to trigger the vulnerable decryption functionality.

**Additional details:**
- The provided commits fix a potential integer overflow in the decrypt function.
- The vulnerability is located in the Media framework.
- The fix involves correcting the size check during decryption.
- The fix is also verified via a test case that uses the HWASan tool to detect out-of-bounds memory access.
