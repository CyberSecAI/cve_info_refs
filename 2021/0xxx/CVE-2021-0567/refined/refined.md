{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the system handles resource loading, specifically font resources. An override mechanism that was intended to restrict loading of unexpected resources was not properly implemented.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of resource loading",
       "Elevation of privilege"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially load unexpected resources, leading to an elevation of privilege (EoP).",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this by manipulating the loading of font resources or similar system resources.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would require the ability to influence or control the system's resource loading process. Specific details about the vulnerability are not provided in the description."
