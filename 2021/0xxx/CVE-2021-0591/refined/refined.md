Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0591:

**CVE Description:**

The provided text references CVE-2021-0591 as part of the Android Security Bulletin for August 2021. It indicates that this vulnerability could enable a local attacker, using a specially crafted transmission, to gain access to additional permissions.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on how Bluetooth settings interact with other applications. Specifically, the `BluetoothPermissionActivity` and `DevicePickerFragment` components within the Settings application were sending broadcasts with an implicit target. This means that any application with a matching intent filter could receive these broadcasts. An attacker could potentially intercept these broadcasts and manipulate the intent to trigger unintended actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Implicit Broadcast Intent:** The vulnerability exists due to the usage of implicit broadcast intents within the Bluetooth settings, which could be intercepted by malicious apps.
*   **Lack of Proper Validation:** There was a lack of validation on the caller package, allowing unauthorized applications to initiate actions through the broadcast mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A malicious local application could leverage this vulnerability to gain access to permissions it shouldn't have. By crafting a specific broadcast intent, an attacker could potentially trigger actions that are otherwise restricted, like factory reset.
*   **Bypassing user interaction:** An attacker could bypass the user confirmation prompts to gain access to additional permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious application installed on the target device.
*   **Specially Crafted Transmission/Broadcast:** The attacker must craft a specific broadcast intent that can be sent through the vulnerable `BluetoothPermissionActivity` or `DevicePickerFragment` components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the vulnerable Android device.
*   **Capability to send intents:** The attacker's application needs to be capable of sending broadcast intents, which is a standard Android capability.

**Technical Details:**

The provided commit messages give details of the fix:

*   The fix involves checking if the calling package name matches the launching package name before invoking `setClassName()`. If the package names are not equal, the `setClassName()` method will not be invoked. This change restricts the broadcast's target.
*   Another fix prevents the `setPackage()` and `setClassName()` from being set for the broadcast intent in `BluetoothPermissionActivity` and `DevicePickerFragment`. This measure will prevent a malicious application from setting the target and exploiting the implicit broadcast.

**Additional Notes:**

* The fix includes changes in `packages/apps/Settings/src/com/android/settings/bluetooth/BluetoothPermissionActivity.java` and `packages/apps/Settings/src/com/android/settings/devicepicker/DevicePickerFragment.java`.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in AOSP versions 8.1, 9, 10, and 11.

In summary, CVE-2021-0591 describes a vulnerability that can be exploited through a local malicious app sending specially crafted broadcasts to elevate privileges. The fix involves restricting the broadcast to the launching package and not allowing setting the target package and class name of the broadcast.
