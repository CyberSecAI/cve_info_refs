  "CVE-2021-0476": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The provided commit message indicates a missing mutex for std::map in `btif_av.cc`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition in the bluetooth stack's audio/video interface (btif_av) due to lack of proper synchronization (mutex) when accessing shared data (specifically a std::map).",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Elevation of privilege (EoP), potentially allowing a malicious actor to gain elevated access or capabilities.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attack, as it affects the system component.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the device is needed to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to trigger bluetooth activity that interacts with the vulnerable `std::map`."
