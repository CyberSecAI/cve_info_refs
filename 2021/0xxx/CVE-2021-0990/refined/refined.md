**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious app that calls the vulnerable `getDeviceId` method without holding the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an application installed on the target device. The application does not need special privileges beyond normal app permissions.
