  "CVE-2021-0426": {
    "description": "The provided text contains information about a fix for potential out-of-bounds writes in LogEvent, related to integer overflows when handling `mUidFieldIndex`, `mExclusiveStateFieldIndex`, and `mAttributionChain{Start|End}Index`. These indices are stored using `int8_t`, which can overflow when `mValues.size()` exceeds `INT8_MAX`. Proper bounds checking was added to prevent this overflow. This commit addresses both Bug 174488848 and Bug 174485572",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow when storing indices in int8_t.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "Potential out-of-bounds write due to integer overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted file or event that causes `mValues.size()` to exceed INT8_MAX.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to trigger the logging of a crafted event, or cause the logging mechanism to process a specific type of log data that exceeds the size limits of the indexing variables.",
    "additional_notes": "This issue is fixed with proper bounds checking. The fix was cherry-picked from commit 53251a491faab1fb88e28b7caf5913842b8d71d."
