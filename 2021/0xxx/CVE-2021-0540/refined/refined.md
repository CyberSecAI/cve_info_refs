    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2021-0540",

      ],
       "Impact": "Elevation of Privilege (EoP). An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges.",
      "Attack vector": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted data payload to the `halWrapperDataCallback` function of the NFC HAL.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would need the capability to communicate with the NFC HAL and send a specially crafted data payload.",
       "More details": "The commit message mentions 'Prevent OOB write in halWrapperDataCallback' which is more descriptive than the CVE description."
