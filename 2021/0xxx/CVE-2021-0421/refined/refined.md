- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing bounds check in the memory management driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local information disclosure. An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from memory.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No additional execution privileges are needed, and user interaction is not required. An attacker would need to be able to execute code locally on the affected device.
