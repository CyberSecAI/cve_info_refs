Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0562:

**CVE Description:** The provided text includes a commit message that describes a fix for an issue related to an out-of-bounds read in the `RasterIntraUpdate` function of the `mpeg4enc` component.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect order of checks in `RasterIntraUpdate` that can lead to an out-of-bounds read within `intraArray`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `intraArray` within the `RasterIntraUpdate` function. This occurs because checks for bounds are performed in the wrong order, allowing a read outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability is classified as an information disclosure vulnerability, implying that an attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the memory region outside of the array.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious Media File:** An attacker could craft a malicious media file that, when processed by a vulnerable application, would trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker would need to be able to provide the malicious crafted file to be processed by the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `RasterIntraUpdate` function of the `mpeg4enc` component.
*   The fix involves changing the order of the checks to prevent out-of-bounds access to `intraArray`.
*   The patch is present in the commit message with the link: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/7a9e8dfebb30d9c864122b52c44d75692e3ad65b](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/7a9e8dfebb30d9c864122b52c44d75692e3ad65b)
