Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `edma` driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** A memory location is accessed after it has been freed, which leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Escalation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges to `System` level.
- **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free leads to memory corruption which could result in unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attack is local, meaning an attacker would need to have some level of access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **System Execution Privileges:** The attacker must have a mechanism to execute code within the target system context. This means, they do not require existing root/system access, however, they do need the ability to trigger the `edma` driver at the right time to cause the use-after-free.
- **No User Interaction:** User interaction is not required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected chipsets and software versions are explicitly listed, which can help in identifying vulnerable devices.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity.
- This vulnerability is a type of memory corruption that can lead to privilege escalation.
