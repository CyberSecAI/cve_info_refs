Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free condition in the dma-buf subsystem. It occurs due to a race condition when closing a dma-buf file and accessing its debug information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-After-Free: A freed `f_inode` within the dma-buf file structure is accessed after being released.
- Race Condition: The race exists between closing the dma-buf file and accessing debug info of the same dma-buf.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege (EoP):  The vulnerability allows a local attacker to potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs local access to the device to trigger the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local User: The attacker must be a local user with the ability to open/close dma-buf files and trigger dma-buf debug information.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability occurs in the following scenario:
1. Process P1 closes a dma-buf file, which leads to the freeing of the dma-buf's `f_inode`. This operation happens through a sequence of calls such as `dma_buf_put`, `__fput`, `file->f_op->release` and `dput`.
2.  Process P2 is trying to access debug info of the same dma-buf through a call to `dma_buf_debug_show()`. P2 is traversing a list and reading `dma_buf->file->f_inode`.
3. The race occurs if P2 attempts to access the dma-buf's `f_inode` after P1 has already freed it, resulting in a use-after-free.

The fix moves the removal of dma-buf from the list from the `d_op->d_release` to `f_op->release` to ensure the `f_inode` is not accessed after being freed.
