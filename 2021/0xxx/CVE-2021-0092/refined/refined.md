Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0092:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper access control in the firmware for some Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from inadequate access control mechanisms within the Intel processor's firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The attacker could also potentially achieve limited modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local access, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system on which the affected firmware is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have privileged access to the system. The vulnerability is only exploitable by a high privileged user.
- The attack requires low attack complexity.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is consistent with the CVE description.
- The NetApp advisory indicates that their products that use the affected Intel processors are vulnerable.
- The NetApp advisory assigns a CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.7 (Medium) for this vulnerability, consistent with Intel's advisory. The vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H, indicating a local attack vector, high privilege requirements and the potential for limited impact to data and high impact to system availability.
- NetApp has released a patch that addresses the issue on affected NetApp systems.
