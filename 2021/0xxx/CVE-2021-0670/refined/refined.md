- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free condition in the `apusys` driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119), specifically a use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege, allowing an attacker to potentially gain elevated privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have system execution privileges to exploit the vulnerability. No user interaction is needed.
