Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0988:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on how an application can retrieve the package name of the referrer. Specifically, an app could bypass intended restrictions using reflection and hidden APIs to obtain the caller's package name. The affected methods are related to determining where an app was launched from.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The core issue is that an application can gain unauthorized access to information about the package that launched it.
- **Bypass of Intended Restrictions:** The original design intended to hide the referrer package name, but apps could circumvent this through reflection.
- **Lack of Proper Access Controls:** Insufficient checks were in place to prevent unauthorized access to the referrer's package name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker could learn which application launched the current activity.
- **Privacy Concerns:** This can lead to the disclosure of user behavior and package information that should be private.
- **Potential for further exploits:** While not immediately clear, knowledge of referrer apps could potentially be used in further exploits by attackers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Reflection:** The primary attack vector involves using reflection to bypass the hidden API restrictions and directly access the methods that provide the referrer's package information.
- **Activity.getReferrer():** The vulnerability could be triggered through methods like Activity.getReferrer(), potentially combined with intent extra removal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Install and Run an Android App:** The attacker needs to have the ability to install an application on the vulnerable Android device.
- **Knowledge of Reflection Techniques:** The attacker must have the technical skills to use reflection to access hidden APIs.
- **No special permissions:** No special permissions are mentioned.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The fix involved providing a referrer package with respect to package visibility and adding a check that if the component name is specified, it belongs to the caller.
- The vulnerability is located in the Android framework.
- The initial vulnerability was found in how `Activity.getReferrer()` was implemented and how apps could bypass restrictions to get the referrer package information.
- The fix includes additional checks to ensure the referrer information is not leaked.

The provided links to the AOSP code changes (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/bc817f1eff9889292bd2b3cad4d4eed56a9a4830 and https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/1d6bc4e1874ae4fbe2695d08464cc2b0f659f997) confirm this vulnerability and the fixes implemented.

The second commit addresses the issue that an app can easily get the caller package name by using Activity.getReferrer() with intent extra removal, or using reflection to get `Activity#mReferrer` directly. This commit enforces package visibility for the referrer.

The third commit adds a check to ensure that if a component name is specified in `hasGrantedPolicy()`, it belongs to the caller. This addresses a similar information disclosure issue by enforcing that the component name belongs to the caller.

The additional commits are related to the fix of a similar issue, where if the component name is specified, then it belongs to the caller.
