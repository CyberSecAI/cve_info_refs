Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-0689:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Skia, a graphics library, handles PNG images with specific sBIT (Significant Bits) chunk values. If a PNG's sBIT specifies that the significant bits are 565, Skia incorrectly treats the image as kRGB_565_SkColorType (a 16-bit color format), instead of the default k32_SkColorType (a 32-bit color format). This incorrect handling also occurs if the PNG is of type PNG_COLOR_TYPE_PALETTE, leading to incorrect interpretation when reading the image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Color Type Handling:** Skia fails to properly interpret the sBIT chunk in PNG files when it specifies 565 significant bits or if the PNG is of type PNG_COLOR_TYPE_PALETTE.
- **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability leads to the library misinterpreting the image data, potentially accessing it in an incorrect manner.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability results in an information disclosure. This means that an attacker could potentially read or expose image data that is not intended to be accessed, due to incorrect handling of color types by the Skia library.
- **Incorrect Image Rendering:** It could lead to the incorrect display of images, with potential consequences for applications that rely on correct image representation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted PNG Files:** An attacker could craft malicious PNG files with the specific sBIT values or type mentioned above, which triggers the incorrect processing by the Skia library.
- **Local Malicious Application:** A local application can utilize this vulnerability by passing the crafted PNG to Skia.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs the ability to run a malicious application that can process a specially crafted PNG image using the vulnerable version of Skia.
- **Knowledge of Skia Processing:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the Skia library and how it processes PNG files and their metadata, as the vulnerability is triggered by specific values in the image's sBIT chunk.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in the Android security patch for September 2021, specifically the 2021-09-01 patch level.
- The fix for this vulnerability is present in the AOSP commit:  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/skia/%2B/63656c27483416ea6483c8064d907d3102c84401
- This vulnerability is considered **High** severity and affects Android versions 8.1, 9, 10, and 11.
