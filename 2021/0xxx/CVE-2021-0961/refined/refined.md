Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0961:

**CVE-2021-0961**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `xt_quota2` netfilter module. Specifically, there was an issue with how the module handled trailing junk data which might contain a digit.

*  **Vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `xt_quota2` module allowed for the possibility of using trailing junk data (potentially containing digits) when processing user-provided strings. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:** The provided information classifies this as an **information disclosure (ID)** vulnerability with a **moderate** severity. This means that under certain circumstances, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information due to this vulnerability. The commit messages suggest the issue could also cause the message buffer to contain random data if not initialized properly.

*   **Attack Vector:** This vulnerability can be exploited locally, likely through a crafted network configuration or interaction with netfilter using a crafted string via user space.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need the ability to interact with the netfilter subsystem. It is likely an unprivileged user could trigger this issue with the correct privileges, depending on how netfilter is configured.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves ensuring the string being processed only contains characters specified by userspace, which prevents the trailing junk data from being processed.
*   The patches also address the potential for random data being sent by initializing the message buffer before use.
* Multiple commits were used to address this vulnerability indicating the complexity of the fix.
