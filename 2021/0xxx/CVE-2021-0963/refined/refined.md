Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the KeyChain app, specifically how it handles overlays. The issue stems from the fact that non-system apps could potentially draw overlays on top of the KeyChain activity, potentially obscuring or modifying the user interface, and leading to unintended user actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of window overlays by the KeyChain app.
- The KeyChain activity did not properly prevent non-system apps from drawing overlays on top of it.
- Lack of sufficient protection against overlay attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A malicious local app could exploit this vulnerability to trick the user into unintended actions by drawing deceptive overlays on top of the KeyChain activity interface.
- **User interface manipulation:** Attackers could potentially hide crucial information or display misleading information to the user.
- **Compromised user trust:** A malicious app can make it appear that the user is interacting with the legitimate KeyChain app when in reality, the user is interacting with the malicious app's overlay.
-  The vulnerability could lead to the user providing sensitive information to an attacker, or granting permissions unintentionally.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack: A malicious application installed on the same device as the vulnerable KeyChain app is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The malicious app would draw a window overlay on top of the KeyChain Activity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs the ability to install a malicious app on the target device.
- The malicious app needs permission to draw overlays (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission or similar).

**Additional details:**
- The fix involved setting `setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(true)` on a confirmation button, which prevents touches when the view is obscured. This change was meant to prevent user interaction with underlying elements while the malicious overlay is active.
-  The fix also includes hiding non-system overlays to improve security.
- The vulnerability was addressed in AOSP versions 9, 10, 11, and 12, as indicated by the Android Security Bulletin.
- Multiple code commits are associated with fixing this vulnerability which implies that the fix might have been applied with different approaches (for example, commit cdca35442c767d64f6d0db4af438a3856263857a and 42d5b5ec58893e5f7f7d3bcc4a1e069aab3481b6)
