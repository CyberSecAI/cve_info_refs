Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0339:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, specifically the commit messages from android.googlesource.com, directly mentions the bug ID "145728687," which is associated with CVE-2021-0339 in the Android Security Bulletin. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the lack of a restriction on the duration of app transition animations. Malicious apps could exploit this by setting very long or infinite animation durations through `ActivityOptions#makeCustomAnimation` or `Activity#overridePendingTransition`. This could potentially lead to a denial-of-service or user interface manipulation attack.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted Animation Duration:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a limit on how long app transition animations can run. This allows malicious apps to create animations that never end, or last for an excessively long period.
- **Abuse of Custom Animations:** Malicious applications could abuse `ActivityOptions#makeCustomAnimation` or `Activity#overridePendingTransition` to set custom, long-lasting animations.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By setting an infinitely long or very long animation, an attacker can effectively freeze or slow down the device's user interface, preventing users from interacting with other apps or the system.
- **User Interface Manipulation:** Long animations could be used to obscure or misrepresent the user interface, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious actions.
- **Resource exhaustion:** Long animations can potentially lead to resource exhaustion

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Application:** The attack vector is a malicious application installed on the Android device. This app would use the aforementioned APIs to set the extended/infinite animations
- **Activity Launch:** The attack is triggered during an activity launch or transition.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the user's device.
- **Access to Android APIs:** The malicious app needs to be able to call the Android APIs like `ActivityOptions#makeCustomAnimation` or `Activity#overridePendingTransition`.
- **Normal Permissions:** No special permissions are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**7. Patch Details**
The patch limits app transition animation duration to 3 seconds to prevent malicious apps from creating long-lasting animations and uses `WindowState#startAnimation` to restrict the maximum duration of window animations, which is currently 10 seconds.
