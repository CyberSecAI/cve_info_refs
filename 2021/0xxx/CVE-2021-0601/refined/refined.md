Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0601:

**CVE-2021-0601**

*   **Root Cause:** An invalid free of raw buffers occurs in the libavc library. Specifically, the issue arises when an error occurs before the input buffer is picked up from the input queue. In this scenario, the code was returning the current input buffer to be freed, which could lead to a double free.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Double free vulnerability due to incorrect buffer management.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** This vulnerability could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a local malicious application exploiting the vulnerability in the libavc library. The specific input that triggers this vulnerability is a crafted media file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute a malicious application on the target device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves ensuring that the current input buffer is returned to be freed only if it has been picked up from the queue and not from the ps\_proc context.

*   The vulnerability is present in AOSP versions 8.1, 9, 10, and 11.
