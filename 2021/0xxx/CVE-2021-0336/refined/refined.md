Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-0336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation in how the Android system handles permission requests related to Bluetooth. Specifically, the intent used to request Bluetooth permissions wasn't restricted to only be handled by the Bluetooth package. This allowed other components to intercept or handle the intent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Intent Restriction:** The primary weakness is the lack of a specific component restriction on the intent used to request Bluetooth permissions. This allows any application that can intercept intents to handle this permission request, potentially leading to malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A malicious application could potentially intercept and handle this permission request, bypassing normal user interaction requirements, and granting itself additional permissions related to Bluetooth. This could lead to unauthorized access and actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** A locally installed malicious application could exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Intent Interception:**  The attacker would need to be able to intercept the intent used to request Bluetooth permission. This could be done by an app registered to handle the intent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
*   **Intent Handling Capability:** The attacker application must be capable of intercepting the specific intent used to request Bluetooth permission.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves limiting the component that can resolve the intent to the Bluetooth package. This ensures that only the authorized Bluetooth app handles the permission request.
*   This issue was addressed in the Android Security Bulletin for February 2021, with the patch being included in the 2021-02-01 security patch level.
*   The vulnerability affects Android versions 8.1, 9, 10, and 11.
*  The provided commit log snippets show the fix implemented by adding the Bluetooth package as a receiver of this intent.
