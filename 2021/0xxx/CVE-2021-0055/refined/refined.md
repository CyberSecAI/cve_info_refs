- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure inherited permissions in the IntelÂ® NUC 9 Extreme Laptop Kit LAN Drivers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The drivers had incorrect permissions that could be exploited by an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An authenticated user could potentially escalate their privileges via local access.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, requiring the attacker to have an existing user account on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be an authenticated user with local access to the system. They also must perform some sort of user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, as indicated by the "UI:R" CVSS metric.
