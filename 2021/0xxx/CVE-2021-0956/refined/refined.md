Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect error handling within the NFC (Near Field Communication) component.
*   Specifically, there is an out-of-bounds write due to an increase in mNumTechList without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The code writes data beyond the allocated memory boundaries, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Incorrect Error Handling:** The error handling does not prevent out-of-bounds access during the processing of tech list in NFC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the device.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Out-of-bounds write can lead to arbitrary memory corruption which can cause unexpected behaviour, crashes, or further exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attacker:** The attacker needs local access to the device to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **NFC Interaction:** The specific attack vector involves the manipulation of NFC tech list processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker requires physical access to the targeted device.
*   **NFC Manipulation:** Ability to manipulate or craft NFC interactions to trigger the error handling code path, specifically how mNumTechList is incremented and used.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text mentions that the fix is available in AOSP for Android versions 11 and 12.
*   The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Critical."
*   The provided text links to the AOSP commit: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Nfc/%2B/7d90cc6e0556057571f9fde9785dd0658c1a3eb0](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Nfc/%2B/7d90cc6e0556057571f9fde9785dd0658c1a3eb0)
