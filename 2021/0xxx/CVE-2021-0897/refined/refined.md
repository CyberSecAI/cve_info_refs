- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition due to a missing bounds check in `apusys`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** TOCTOU race condition leads to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker. No user interaction required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires System execution privileges.
