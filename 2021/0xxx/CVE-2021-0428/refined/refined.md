Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0428:

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-0428 is an information disclosure vulnerability affecting Android 10, stemming from insufficient protection of device identifiers. Specifically, the `SubscriptionInfo` API exposed sensitive information (ICC ID and card string) that should have been restricted by the new identifier access requirements introduced in Android 10.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the inconsistent application of access restrictions for device identifiers. While `TelephonyManager#getSimSerialNumber` was correctly guarded behind the new access requirements (`READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission, carrier privileges, or device/profile owner check),  `SubscriptionInfo#getIccId` and `SubscriptionInfo#getCardString` were not properly protected. This allowed apps without the necessary permissions to access these identifiers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive device identifiers (ICC ID and card string) through `SubscriptionInfo#getIccId` and `SubscriptionInfo#getCardString` to apps lacking proper authorization.
-   **Inconsistent Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from an inconsistency in how access controls were applied to different APIs providing similar information. `TelephonyManager#getSimSerialNumber` was properly guarded, while the `SubscriptionInfo` counterparts were not.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Privacy violation:** Exploitation allows malicious apps to obtain device identifiers without proper permissions, potentially leading to tracking, profiling, and other privacy violations.
-   **Circumvention of Security Measures:** By bypassing intended access controls, attackers can gain access to identifiers designed to be protected.

**Attack vectors:**

-   A malicious app could call the `SubscriptionInfo#getIccId` or `SubscriptionInfo#getCardString` API to obtain sensitive information without holding the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission, carrier privileges, or device/profile owner status.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Malicious Application:** The attacker needs to install a malicious application on the device.
-   **No special permissions required:** The malicious application does not require the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission or other privileged access to exploit this vulnerability as it circumvents existing protections.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

-   Several commits address this issue, including changes to:
    -   Clear out card strings from `SubscriptionInfo` objects if the caller doesn't meet identifier access requirements.
    -   Clear out ICC IDs from `SubscriptionInfo` objects when access requirements are not met.
    -   Move permission checks out of synchronized blocks for performance improvement.
    -   Whitelist `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` for the contacts provider to prevent issues with database upgrades, while still addressing the core vulnerability by correctly guarding access to the identifiers.
    -   Update documentation for `getIccId` to reflect access restrictions.
    -   Fix a bug that could disable grouped CBRS during a profile switch on a primary SIM.
    -   Remove unnecessary locking to avoid potential deadlocks.

-   The fix ensures that the `SubscriptionInfo` object does not return sensitive information if the caller does not have the required permissions.
