Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0086:

**CVE-2021-0086** is related to **Floating Point Value Injection (FPVI)**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a microarchitectural behavior in some CPUs where speculative execution of floating point operations may lead to type confusion in registers, potentially leaking data. Specifically, it involves observable response discrepancies in floating-point operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Speculative Execution:** Modern processors speculatively execute instructions, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the speculation is based on incorrect or attacker-controlled data. In this case, the vulnerability exists due to transient execution behavior of floating-point operations.
- **Type Confusion:** During speculative execution, the processor may misinterpret the type of data in registers. This can result in a state where, even though the outcome of the operation is discarded, the transient state can leak data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially infer the contents of arbitrary host memory, including memory assigned to other guests in a virtualized environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access, requiring an authorized user on the system. The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target CPU.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authorized user with the ability to execute code on the targeted system.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence floating point operations and observe their results.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is related to, but distinct from, "Speculative Code Store Bypass" (SCSB).
- Xen is believed to be not vulnerable to FPVI. This is because, although Xen on x86 emulates floating-point operations, it does not have subsequent control flow dependent on the transient or otherwise results of the operation.
- Intel recommends following certain guidelines in software, such as process isolation and avoiding NaN-boxing techniques.

The provided content details the nature of the FPVI vulnerability, its potential impact, and that it was discovered alongside the SCSB vulnerability. The information is consistent with and expands upon the official CVE description. It also notes that Xen itself is considered not vulnerable to FPVI, even though the underlying hardware is susceptible.
