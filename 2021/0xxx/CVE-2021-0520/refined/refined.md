Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (UAF) issue that occurs in the `clearkey` service's `MemoryFileSystem`.
*   A race condition exists where a `MemoryFileSystem` handle can be freed twice.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core vulnerability is a UAF, where memory is accessed after it has been freed. This is a classic memory corruption vulnerability.
*   **Race Condition:** The UAF is triggered due to a race condition, indicating a concurrency issue in the service's logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability has a High severity, indicating a potential for an attacker to elevate their privileges.
*   The provided information does not specify the exact impact of successful exploitation, but UAF can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker. This implies the attacker already has some level of access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to trigger the race condition within the `clearkey` service. This likely requires some form of local code execution or ability to manipulate the system's state.

**Additional Notes**
* The fix is part of the Android 2021-06-01 security patch level
* The vulnerability is present in Android versions 10 and 11.
