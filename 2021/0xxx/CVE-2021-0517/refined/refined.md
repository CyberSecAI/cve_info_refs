  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-0517",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to how packet sizes are checked in `avrc_pars_browse_rsp` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of packet size"
      ],
       "impact": "Information Disclosure",

        "A malicious application may be able to craft a specific packet which will cause the system to disclose information."

    },
    {
     "cve_id": "CVE-2021-0517",
      "root_cause": "The NetworkInfo state can incorrectly get into SUSPENDED state even if the capabilities have the NOT_SUSPENDED capability. This occurs because the code in updateCapabilities only checks for changes in NOT_SUSPENDED and NOT_ROAMING when the capabilities change.",
      "weaknesses":[
        "Incorrect state management when switching VPNs",
        "Incomplete capability change checks"
      ],
      "impact": "Incorrect results returned by legacy APIs which depend on NetworkInfo. This may potentially cause applications to behave incorrectly.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious app might be able to indirectly trigger incorrect behavior when a VPN switches to a suspended network or vice versa."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker can indirectly cause an application to have unexpected behavior when a VPN connection is changed."
