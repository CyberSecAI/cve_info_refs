Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0307:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2021-0307 and includes relevant commit messages. The CVE description in the Android Security Bulletin for January 2021 confirms that this CVE is related to an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Android Framework.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from an issue related to permission revocation in the Android framework. Specifically, the issue involves how the system handles the revocation of install permissions when the defining app is uninstalled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core weakness is that install permissions might not be correctly revoked when the app that defines those permissions is uninstalled. This implies a flaw in the logic that manages permission lifecycle tied to application installation and uninstallation events.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges. By manipulating permission revocation, an attacker could potentially gain access to resources or capabilities that should not be available to their application, or retain access to permissions after the app that defined them is uninstalled.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves the uninstallation of an application that defines install permissions. A malicious application might be designed to exploit this weakness when the defining application is removed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker would need to be able to install an application on the target device and manipulate the permission model by uninstalling a permission-defining app at the right time in order to keep permissions. The attacker does not need to have root access initially to perform this attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The commit messages highlight the fix as revoking install permissions when the permission defining app is uninstalled.
- The Android Security Bulletin lists this as an "EoP" (Elevation of Privilege) vulnerability with a High severity.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 10 and 11.
