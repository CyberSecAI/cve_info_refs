- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's blocks allow users with Contributor role or higher to inject malicious JavaScript code through the `headingURL` parameter within a block's settings. This occurs because the plugin doesn't properly sanitize or validate this input, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The primary vulnerability is that the plugin's block allows for unsanitized input in the `headingURL` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code which will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, or any other actions that can be performed by JavaScript in the context of the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Contributor access or higher can insert malicious JavaScript code via the `headingURL` field in any of the plugin's blocks using the code editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have Contributor level access or higher within the WordPress website, allowing them to create and edit posts/pages.
