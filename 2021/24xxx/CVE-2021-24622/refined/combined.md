## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Ticket < 5.10.4 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize or escape form fields before outputting it in the List, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Navigate to WP Ticket > Forms > edit layout of "Open a Ticket" or "Search Tickets" > on "Editing Form" Setting menu.
Select a form field and you can edit the "Label" with a cross-site scripting (XSS) payload such as
v < 5.10.3 - "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
v <= 5.10.3 - " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
All of the parameters on the "Editing Form" are vulnerable.
To trigger the XSS payload, refresh the "Editing Form" page.
