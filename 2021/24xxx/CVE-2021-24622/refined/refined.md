- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize or escape form fields before outputting them in the list, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: By editing the "Label" field of a form field within the "Editing Form" settings of the plugin, an attacker can inject XSS payloads. The XSS is triggered when the "Editing Form" page is refreshed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (Admin+).
