- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests that can modify payment history data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate payment history, including changing the status of payments (e.g., from pending to completed) and potentially alter other payment details.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, sends forged requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting the crafted form, typically through social engineering or embedding it on a malicious site.
