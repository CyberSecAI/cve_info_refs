Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Flightlog WordPress plugin fails to properly sanitize, validate, or escape several POST parameters before using them in SQL queries. This lack of input sanitization allows for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Time-based blind SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection, where an attacker can infer information about the database by observing the time it takes for the server to respond to injected SQL queries, which include `SLEEP()` calls.
* **Multiple Injection Points:** Several parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection:
    * `from` (Editor Level)
    * `to` (Editor Level)
    * `id` (Admin Level)
    * `flight_id` (Editor Level)
* The injection points are located within the `flightlog.php` file, specifically at lines 520, 527, 302, 316 and 546.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, flight data, and other confidential information.
* **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data within the database.
* **Complete System Takeover:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, a successful SQL injection could potentially lead to a complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited through crafted HTTP POST requests to specific WordPress plugin endpoints.
* **Vulnerable Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are `from`, `to`, `id`, and `flight_id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Editor or Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have at least "Editor" level access to the WordPress site to exploit most of the vulnerabilities. The `id` parameter requires "Admin" level access.

**Additional Details:**
* **Blind Time Based Injection:** The specific type of SQL injection is time-based blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker cannot directly see the results of their queries. Instead they use time delays using sleep function to extract data.
* **Specific Code Locations:** The vulnerable code snippets are provided, pinpointing the exact lines of code where the SQL queries are constructed with user-supplied input.
* **Proof-of-Concept (PoC):** The content provides detailed steps on how to reproduce the vulnerability, including sample HTTP requests and SQLMap outputs.
