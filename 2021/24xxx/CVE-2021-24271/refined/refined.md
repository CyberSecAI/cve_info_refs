Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24271:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper server-side sanitization of HTML tags within the "Ultimate Addons for Elementor" plugin.
*   Specifically, the plugin allows users to select an HTML tag from a dropdown menu to format text elements. However, it doesn't properly validate or enforce these tags, leading to the ability to inject arbitrary HTML, including `<script>` tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious code injected by an attacker is stored in the database and executed when a user views or interacts with the affected content.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the chosen HTML tag for text elements, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML code.
*   **Insecure Code Pattern:** The plugin follows an insecure pattern found in Elementor's documentation and code examples, allowing injection of Javascript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Site Takeover:** If the injected JavaScript is executed within an administrator's browser session, an attacker can potentially take over the entire site.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers can use XSS to escalate their privileges from contributor to administrator by injecting JavaScript into the browser of an administrator, allowing them to perform admin actions.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can potentially perform a variety of malicious actions on the site, such as redirecting users, injecting malware, or stealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Settings:** The vulnerability is present in multiple widgets provided by the "Ultimate Addons for Elementor" plugin, each allowing for the injection of malicious code via the HTML tag selection for text elements.
*   **Direct Script Injection:** An attacker can change an allowed tag (e.g., "H5") to a "script" tag via an intercepted request. They can then insert malicious Javascript within this tag or within other parameters.
*   **Remote Script Inclusion:** Even if direct script insertion is blocked, an attacker may use an HTML tag to load an external script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Contributor Account (or higher):**  An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. This is because the exploit requires access to the Elementor editor.
*   **Ability to Modify Content:** The attacker needs the ability to add or modify content via the Elementor editor, which is typically granted to users with the contributor role or higher.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to vulnerabilities found in the main Elementor plugin, where insecure handling of HTML tags was also present.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.30.0 of the "Ultimate Addons for Elementor" plugin.
*   Wordfence firewall rule protects against this vulnerability since March 25, 2021.
