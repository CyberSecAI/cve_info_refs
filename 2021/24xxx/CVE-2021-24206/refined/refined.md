{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Elementor plugin's image box widget accepts a 'title_size' parameter. This parameter, while intended to accept HTML tags, does not properly validate or sanitize the input on the server-side. This allows users to inject arbitrary JavaScript by crafting a modified 'save_builder' request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Improper output escaping",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. If the victim is an administrator, this could lead to complete site takeover, including the creation of new malicious administrators or adding backdoors.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a modified 'save_builder' request with malicious JavaScript in the 'title_size' parameter of the image box widget."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs contributor-level or higher access to the WordPress site to use the Elementor editor and save changes. They also need the ability to craft a modified save_builder request containing malicious Javascript."

    }
  ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is saved in the database and executed when the affected page is viewed, edited or previewed by other site users. The root cause lies in several Elementor elements that did not properly validate user-controlled HTML tag parameters, and the issue could not always be fixed via output escaping. The vulnerability was patched in version 3.1.4 by implementing server-side validation of allowed HTML tags.",
