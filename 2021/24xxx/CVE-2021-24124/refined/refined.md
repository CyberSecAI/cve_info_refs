The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24124.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` being echoed on the CAPTCHA page without proper encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the CAPTCHA page, which can then be executed in the victim's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious script. When a user accesses this URL, the vulnerable application echoes the unencoded URI, leading to script execution in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL. No authentication or specific position within the system is required, as the vulnerability is unauthenticated.
