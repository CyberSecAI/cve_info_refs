{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control within the `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` AJAX action present in multiple plugins from the WP-Buy vendor.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is an access control bypass (CWE-284). Low-privileged users can trigger the `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` AJAX action to install arbitrary plugins, including specific versions from the WordPress repository. This action can also be used to activate plugins.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows low-privileged users to install or activate arbitrary plugins. This can lead to the installation of vulnerable plugins that could expose the site to more critical vulnerabilities, such as Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the vulnerable AJAX action `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback`. This can be triggered by sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with appropriate parameters (`action`, `slug` or `plugin_file` ).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be a low-privileged user on the WordPress site and have the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server."
