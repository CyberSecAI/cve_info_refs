- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when cleaning logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can make a logged-in admin delete all logs through a CSRF attack.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed through a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint: `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=jj4t3-logs&action=bulk_clean`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website which executes the crafted request.
