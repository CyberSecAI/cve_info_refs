- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the `handle` parameter in the REST API. This allows an attacker to manipulate the parameter for path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Path Traversal, lack of input sanitization and validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can overwrite arbitrary CSS files with attacker-controlled content. They can also download fonts from Google Fonts website into arbitrary server directories.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the REST API endpoint, specifically `/wp-json/omgf/v1/download/css`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
