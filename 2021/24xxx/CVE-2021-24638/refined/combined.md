## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# OMGF < 4.5.4 - Unauthenticated Path Traversal in REST API

### Description

The plugin does not escape or validate the handle parameter of the REST API, which allows unauthenticated users to perform path traversal and overwrite arbitrary CSS file with Google Fonts CSS, or download fonts uploaded on Google Fonts website.

### Proof of Concept

Access the URL below as unauthenticated. "cssfilename" is the file name of the CSS, excluding .css extension. The result will contain PHP error about missing directories, but should overwrite the file nonetheless. If an existing directory name is supplied, it will also download the specified fonts to that directory.
https://example.com/wp-json/omgf/v1/download/css?handle=/../../path/to/css/cssfilename&original\_handle=b&family=Sora
