## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# YT Player < 1.4 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or validate the parameters from its shortcode, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to set Cross-Site Scripting payload in them which will be triggered in the page/s with the embed malicious shortcode

### Proof of Concept

Log in as contributor and add the following shortcode in a post [ytplayer id='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']
Then view the post and move the mouse over the embed YT player to trigger the XSS
