- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or validate the parameters from its shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page, which will be executed when a user views that page. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with a role as low as contributor can add a malicious shortcode to a post. When another user views this post, the XSS payload is triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least contributor privileges.
