- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `tab` parameter on the settings page of the 404 SEO Redirection plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user input before outputting it within an attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which can lead to various malicious actions like stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing the payload in the `tab` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious script and trick a user into clicking it. No special privileges are needed, only the ability to get the victim to access the malicious link.
