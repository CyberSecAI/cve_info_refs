Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `url` GET parameter in the `wblm-edit-url.php` file is not sanitized, escaped, or validated before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `url` parameter, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  In some cases, it might be possible to gain higher privileges within the database.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution depending on database configuration and privileges.
*   In this specific case the PoC shows the ability to extract the database user and hostname.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted GET request to the `wp-admin/admin.php` file with a malicious `url` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Admin Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is in `wblm-url-edit.php` at line 4:
    ```php
    $url = $_GET['url'];
    global $wpdb;
    $urlInfo = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT * FROM " . TABLE_WBLM . " where id = $url");
    ```
*   The `$url` variable is directly inserted into the SQL query without any sanitization.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code using the `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to extract database information.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions 0.6.5 and possibly earlier versions of the "Broken Link Manager" WordPress plugin.
*   The issue was reported to WPScan on June 1, 2021, and publicly disclosed on July 23, 2021.
* The CVSS score of 5.5 (Medium) has an attack vector of Network, Low complexity, High privileges required, and no User Interaction. It has a Confidentiality and Integrity impact of Low with no impact on Availability.
