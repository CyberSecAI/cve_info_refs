Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The WordPress plugin "WP iCommerce" fails to properly sanitize the `order_id` parameter in the `/admin/order/order.php` file before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization and escaping of the `order_id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to access, modify, or delete data within the WordPress database.
- **Information Disclosure:** The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the ability to extract database user information.
- **Full System Compromise:**  The injection could potentially be leveraged to gain further access, depending on the database user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint with a crafted `order_id` parameter.
- **`order_id` parameter:** The `order_id` parameter within the URL is the specific vector that is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level privileges in WordPress to access the vulnerable functionality.
- **Access to admin panel:** The vulnerable page `wp-admin/admin.php` is part of the admin panel, so the attacker will need access to it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code block is located in `/admin/order/order.php` at line 137.
- The vulnerable SQL query is: `SELECT * FROM {$wpdb_all_prefix}order_item where fk_order_id = ".$_GET['order_id']." ORDER BY order_item_id ASC`
- The provided PoC uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to inject a malicious query into the SQL statement.
