- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape user-supplied input in the "Placeholder / Options" field of the "Field Editor" settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled data before rendering it, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected and executed in the context of other users' browsers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Placeholder / Options" field, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the affected page. This could lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via the "Field Editor" page within the WordPress admin panel. An attacker with high privileges (Admin+) can inject malicious code into the "Placeholder / Options" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a WordPress administrator or other user with sufficient privileges to access the "Field Editor" page and modify plugin settings.
