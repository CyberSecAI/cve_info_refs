Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of the `cg-search-user-name-original` parameter before it's used in a SQL query. Additionally, there are missing access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, caused by directly incorporating user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Missing Access Controls:** The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users, meaning there are no authorization checks in place to prevent unauthorized access to the vulnerable functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including usernames and email addresses of all registered users in the WordPress blog.
*   **Database manipulation:** Although not explicitly mentioned, the SQL injection could potentially allow further database manipulation such as data modification or deletion.
*   **Server information:** As shown in the provided exploit, database version can be extracted via SQL injection.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected into the `cg-search-user-name-original` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges on the target WordPress site.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to extract the database version using a SQL injection.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the Contest Gallery plugin prior to 13.1.0.6.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a broken access control issue and is related to CWE-284.
*   The CVSS score is 8.6 (High), indicating the severity of the vulnerability.
