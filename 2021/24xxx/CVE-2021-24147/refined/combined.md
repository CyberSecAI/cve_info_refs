## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Modern Events Calendar Lite < 5.16.5 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin did not sanitise the mic\_comment field (Notes on time) when adding/editing an event, allowing users with privilege as low as author to add events with a Cross-Site Scripting payload in them, which will be triggered in the frontend when viewing the event.

Edit (WPScanTeam)

January 22nd, 2021 - Vendor Contacted via their ticket support (https://support.webnus.net/)

January 23rd, 2021 - Vendor stated It's not a security issue and a role manager plugin should be installed, escalated to WordPress Plugins Team.

January 27th, 2021 - v5.16.5 released, fixing the issue
