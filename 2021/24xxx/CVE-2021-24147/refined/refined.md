- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin did not sanitize the `mic_comment` field (Notes on time) when adding/editing an event.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `mic_comment` field, which will be executed when other users view the event in the frontend. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by adding/editing an event and inserting the XSS payload in the `mic_comment` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least author privileges to add or edit events.
