Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper server-side validation and enforcement of restrictions (like Cookie, IP, or Logged-In User) when handling AJAX requests for likes and dislikes on comments. The plugin relied solely on client-side checks, which could be easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:**  The plugin directly uses the `comment_id` from the request without validating the user's permission to interact with the specified comment.
- **Lack of Server-Side Validation:** The plugin fails to perform server-side checks to ensure that the like/dislike request is legitimate based on the defined restriction modes.
- **Bypassable Client-Side Restrictions:** The implemented "restriction modes" only performed checks on the client-side, which are easily bypassed by an attacker manipulating requests.
- **Replay Attack:** The AJAX requests for liking/disliking could be replayed repeatedly, allowing a user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited likes/dislikes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Vote Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the number of likes/dislikes on any comment.
- **Potential for Spam/Abuse:** This could be used to artificially inflate the popularity of certain comments or deface comments with a large number of dislikes.
- **Reputational Damage:**  The plugin could be perceived as unreliable and buggy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Directly crafted HTTP POST request:** An attacker can capture the AJAX request used when adding a like, modify, and repeatedly replay it.
- **Bypass of client-side checks:** The attacker bypasses client-side restrictions by replaying the request directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic knowledge of HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to understand how to capture, modify and replay HTTP POST requests, specifically AJAX requests.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to perform this attack

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.4 of the plugin.
- The initial fix in v1.1.3 only addressed the "Logged In User Restriction" mode, not other restriction modes (Cookie and IP) which allowed the bypass.
- The exploit could be performed even when the user is not logged in, and regardless of IP or cookie-based restrictions.
