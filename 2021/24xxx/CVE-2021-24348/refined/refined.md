Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `side-menu` WordPress plugin's menu delete functionality. The plugin directly uses the `did` GET parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization, validation, or escaping. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability. This occurs because the plugin uses unsanitized user input (`did` parameter) directly in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the WordPress database. This could potentially lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Access, modification or deletion of sensitive information.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Creation of new admin accounts or changing existing user roles, leading to full control of the website.
    *   **Website Takeover:** Complete compromise of the WordPress website.
    *   **Denial of Service:** By injecting queries that overload the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `wp-admin/admin.php` page with the vulnerable `did` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated as a WordPress administrator. This means they must have a valid user account with administrator privileges on the WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `admin/partials/main.php`
*   **Vulnerable Code (Line 13):**  `$wpdb->query("delete from " . $data . " where id=" . $delid);`
*   The provided code snippet shows that the `$delid` variable (obtained from the `did` GET parameter) is concatenated directly into the SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.
*   The vulnerability is a **time-based blind SQL injection**, meaning that the attacker may not get direct results but can infer information based on time delays caused by injected SQL commands (like `SLEEP()`).
*   The PoC shows how to inject a simple `OR 1=1` to test if the injection is working.
*   The SQLmap command is provided, demonstrating how to use the tool for exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.1.5 of the plugin.

This detailed breakdown is consistent with the information provided in the CVE description, and it also includes additional details extracted from the provided content, such as vulnerable file and code snippet, PoC, and SQLmap command.
