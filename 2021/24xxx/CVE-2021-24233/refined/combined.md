## **Summary**

Cooked Pro is a WordPress recipe plugin from BoxyStudio that helps in creating and displaying recipes on WordPress websites. The pro version of the plugin was found to be vulnerable to reflected XSS vulnerability.

> Reflected cross-site scripting (or XSS) arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way.
>
