- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin has an endpoint that renders user-supplied values in the HTML response without proper sanitization or escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement or redirecting users to malicious sites, and unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can craft a malicious POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint. The attacker must first obtain a valid nonce value from the site's HTML source code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication and the nonce can be found by anyone visiting the site. The attacker must be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint, including the malicious payload and the nonce.
