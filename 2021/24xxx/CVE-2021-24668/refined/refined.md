- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MAZ Loader plugin does not implement nonce checks, allowing attackers to bypass security measures designed to prevent CSRF attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The plugin fails to validate the origin of requests, allowing unauthorized actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can make administrators delete arbitrary loaders.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious link or web page that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, triggers the deletion of loaders via a forged request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage.
