Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `export_data` function within the Simple 301 Redirects plugin lacked both capability checks and nonce verification. This allowed unauthenticated users to trigger the function. The `admin_init` action hook made the function accessible via `/wp-admin/admin-post.php`, which is accessible to all users regardless of authentication status.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness was the absence of access controls on the `export_data` function, making it accessible to unauthenticated users.
*   **Missing Capability Checks:** The function didn't verify if the user had the necessary permissions to export redirect data.
*  **Missing Nonce Checks:** The function didn't verify if the request was legitimate via a nonce.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The `export_data` function could be exploited to export a site's redirect data, potentially revealing sensitive information.
*   **Redirect Manipulation:** While less severe than the `import_data` vulnerability, this export vulnerability could be a stepping stone for further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker can send a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` endpoint, specifying the `page` parameter to be `301options` and the `export` parameter to `true`, triggering the `export_data` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability, as long as the vulnerable plugin is installed.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target website to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content also details other vulnerabilities within the same plugin, including arbitrary plugin installation and activation (CVE-2021-24354, CVE-2021-24356) and wildcard activation/retrieval (CVE-2021-24355). However, CVE-2021-24352 specifically relates to the unauthenticated export vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.4 of the plugin.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.9 (Critical).
