## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Form Builder by Bitware <= 1.0 - Authenticated Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The EFBP\_verify\_upload\_file AJAX action of the plugin, available to authenticated users, does not have any security in place to verify uploaded files, allowing low-privilege users to upload arbitrary files, leading to RCE.

### Proof of Concept

The PoC will be displayed once the issue has been remediated.

### Affects Plugins

# Easy Form Builder <= 1.0 - Arbitrary File Upload

Easy Form Builder 1.0 is a free plugin designed to provide a highly customized form to the plugin user, and allow the user
with admin privilege to create a registration page for the visitor. in order to provide the functionality, it uses a publicly
accessible AJAX function, EFBP\_verify\_upload\_file\_callback.

```
<?php
function EFBP_verify_upload_file_callback()
{
    $total = count($_FILES['file']['name']);
    $upload_dir = wp_upload_dir();
    $uploadFolderPath = $upload_dir['basedir']; // this will make uploads folder in the wp-content. it will be outside the plugin folder

    // Loop through each file
    for ($i = 0; $i < $total; $i++) {
        if ($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'][$i] != "") {
            //Setup our new file path
            $newFilePath = $uploadFolderPath . "/formbuilder/" . $_FILES['file']['name'][$i];
            //Upload the file into the temp dir
            if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'][$i], $newFilePath)) {
                echo $i . ". " . $newFilePath . " <br> ";
            }
        }
    }
    wp . die();
}
```

While the developer tired to limit the file upload types, he or she doesn't solve this problem correctly. The developer provides
a list of file types to "Block" or "Only Allow" the uploaded files, but this list doesn't block the .php file.

[![image](https://github.com/jinhuang1102/CVE-ID-Reports/raw/master/Easy%20Form%20ext%20list.png)](https://github.com/jinhuang1102/CVE-ID-Reports/blob/master/Easy%20Form%20ext%20list.png)

As a result, File with .php (executable) extension will be stored in the local directory, `wp_upload_dir()/formbuilder/`, without any restriction.
