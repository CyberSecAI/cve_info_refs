Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper file type validation in the `EFBP_verify_upload_file_callback` AJAX function of the "Easy Form Builder" plugin. While the plugin attempts to control allowed file types via a blacklist or whitelist, it fails to prevent the upload of files with `.php` extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload arbitrary files, including executable ones like PHP files.
- **Insecure File Handling:** The code uses `move_uploaded_file` to save files directly to the server without proper sanitization or checks.
- **Missing or Inadequate File Type Validation:** The file extension check was not robust, allowing files with `.php` extensions to bypass any restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can achieve RCE on the server. This allows them to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or other malicious actions.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker can upload malicious content and deface the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **AJAX Endpoint Exploitation:** The vulnerability is accessible via the publicly accessible AJAX function `EFBP_verify_upload_file_callback`.
- **File Upload:** The attack vector is based on the ability to upload a file, in this case a .php file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user, including low-privileged users.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable WordPress site over the network to perform the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided code snippet shows that the plugin stores uploaded files under `wp_upload_dir()/formbuilder/`.
- The plugin versions affected are `Easy Form Builder <= 1.0`.
- The issue is related to an insecure file upload via the `EFBP_verify_upload_file_callback` AJAX endpoint.
