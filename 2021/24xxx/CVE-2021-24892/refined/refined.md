Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24892:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the `edit` function of the Advanced Forms plugin (both free and pro versions). The plugin allows a user to modify form data, and this data includes a `user` parameter that corresponds to a WordPress user ID. This user ID is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to modify this parameter and thus target a different user, including administrative accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authorization checks when handling user IDs. The plugin trusts the `user` parameter value coming from the client-side without verifying the legitimacy of access for the authenticated user.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The plugin decodes a base64 encoded JSON string containing the user ID from a hidden form field. No validation or sanitization is performed on the decoded `user` parameter before using it.
- **Missing Nonce:** Although there is a nonce implemented, it is not used to protect the user id. The nonce is used to prevent modification of form arguments after they are rendered to prevent tampering, but it does not prevent the user ID from being modified in the first place.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary User Email Address Update:** An attacker can change the email address of any user on the WordPress site by modifying the user ID in the form data.
- **Account Takeover:** By changing the target user's email address, the attacker can then initiate a password reset request, gaining control of the targeted user's account, potentially including administrator accounts, resulting in full site compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request Modification:** The attacker intercepts the HTTP POST request sent when editing user information.
- **Form Data Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the base64 encoded JSON data within the `af_form_args` and `_acf_form` parameters to modify the `user` parameter to the ID of the victim user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the target WordPress site (subscriber level is sufficient).
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g. through a proxy).
- **Knowledge of User IDs:** The attacker needs to know or guess the User ID of the target user. By default the first user ID created is 1.
