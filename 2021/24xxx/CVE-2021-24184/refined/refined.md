Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Tutor LMS plugin had several AJAX endpoints that were not protected with capability checks or nonce verification. Specifically, the `tutor_add_instructor` AJAX action was vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Capability Checks:** The plugin lacked proper checks to verify if the user had the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.
*   **Unprotected AJAX endpoints:** Several AJAX endpoints were not protected. In the context of CVE-2021-24184, the `tutor_add_instructor` AJAX action was directly accessible without capability checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  A low-level authenticated user (e.g., a student) could exploit this vulnerability to grant themselves the "instructor" role, gaining elevated privileges.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** After privilege escalation, the attacker could perform instructor-level actions such as modifying course content, creating quizzes, and potentially more, leading to malicious content on the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the affected WordPress site, even with a low-level role like "student".
*  **Nonce:** The attacker needs to retrieve a nonce value from the `/wp-admin` dashboard to make the exploit work.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was found in Tutor LMS versions <= 1.7.6.
*   The fix was released in version 1.7.7.
*   The provided proof of concept code demonstrates how an attacker can use `curl` to log in as a student, retrieve a nonce, and then use the `tutor_add_instructor` action to create a new instructor account with specified credentials.
