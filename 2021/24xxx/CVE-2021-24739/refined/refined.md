- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Logo Carousel plugin allows users with Contributor roles or higher to duplicate arbitrary private posts via the Carousel Duplication feature. This is due to the lack of proper access control on the duplication functionality, which doesn't verify if the user has the required permissions to access and duplicate the specified post.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin uses the post ID directly in the duplicate action URL, without proper authorization checks. This allows an attacker to modify the post ID to access other user's private posts.
    - **Broken Access Control:** The plugin does not properly validate if the user has the necessary permission to duplicate the specified post.
    
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Unauthorized Private Post Access:** An attacker with Contributor role can duplicate and view private posts of other users. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, as private posts are meant to be restricted to the author and other authorized users.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least Contributor role privileges.
    - The attacker needs to create or find a carousel shortcode.
    - The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the ID of the private post they wish to access.
    - The attacker visits the crafted malicious URL.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have a WordPress account with Contributor role or higher.
    - The attacker must have knowledge of the plugin's functionality, specifically the "Duplicate" action.
    - The attacker needs to be able to manipulate URL parameters.
