## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Get Custom Field Values < 4.0.1 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape custom fields before outputting them in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, create a custom field in a post, with the following payload: <script>alert(1)</script>
Then add the following shortcode to the post: [custom\_field field="<custom\_field\_name>"]

### Affects Plugins
