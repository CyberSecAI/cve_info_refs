- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize custom fields before outputting them, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view the affected pages. This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other harmful actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By creating or modifying custom fields with malicious script and then using the plugin's shortcode to display the unsanitized content on a page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs at least contributor-level access to create or modify posts and custom fields.
