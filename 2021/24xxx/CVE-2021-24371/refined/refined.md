Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24371

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the URL provided to the import functionality of the RSVPMaker plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses `wp_remote_get()` on a user-supplied URL without verifying that it is not an internal resource, which leads to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core weakness is the plugin's ability to make requests to arbitrary URLs controlled by a user. This allows an attacker to force the server to make HTTP requests to internal or external resources.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to validate the URL supplied to the import function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Internal Network Scanning:** An attacker can use the SSRF vulnerability to scan internal networks, potentially revealing information about internal services.
* **Information Disclosure:** Depending on the target of the SSRF request, sensitive information could be obtained.
* **Denial of Service:** An attacker may be able to use the vulnerability to overload services by targeting them with the vulnerable request.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP Request:** The attacker makes a POST request to the `/wp-json/rsvpmaker/v1/importnow` endpoint, including a crafted URL within the `importrsvp` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be logged into the WordPress site with administrator-level privileges or higher.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable code is located in `rsvpmaker-admin.php` around line 729, specifically where `wp_remote_get($url)` is used without proper validation.
* The provided PoC demonstrates how a request to an internal IP and port is made through the plugin.

**Affected Versions:** RSVPMaker plugin versions before 8.7.3 are vulnerable. The issue was fixed in version 8.7.3.

**CVSS Score:** 4.1 (Medium) with vector `AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N`.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Shreya Pohekar of Codevigilant Project.
* The timeline shows that the issue was reported to WPScan in May 2021 and publicly disclosed in June 2021.
