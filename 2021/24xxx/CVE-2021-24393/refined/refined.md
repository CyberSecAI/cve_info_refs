Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `c` GET parameter within the Comment Highlighter plugin is not properly sanitized, escaped, or validated before being inserted into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `c` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify database records.
    *   Potentially gain full control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the WordPress admin page with a malicious payload in the `c` parameter.
*   Specifically, the vulnerable code is located in `/comment_highlighter.php#252`: `$_meta  = $wpdb->get_row ( "SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->comments} WHERE comment_ID = {$_GET['c']};" ) ;`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Administrator:** The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter `c` is used to directly construct a SQL query without proper sanitization which leads to SQL Injection.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject SQL using a UNION ALL SELECT statement to retrieve the database user.
*   The affected versions include Comment Highlighter <= 0.13

**CVSS:**

*   CVSS score: 6.7 (Medium)
*   CVSS vector:  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Syed Sheeraz Ali of Codevigilant.
*   The plugin has been closed.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2021-07-23
