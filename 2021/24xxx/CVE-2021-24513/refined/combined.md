## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Form Builder < 1.9.8.4 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or escape its Form Title, allowing high privilege users such as admin to set Cross-Site Scripting payload in them, even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Create a new Form via the plugin, go to Form Settings then add the following payload in the Title field: "><img src onerror=alert(1)> and save the form
The XSS will be triggered when viewing/editing the form in the admin dashboard
