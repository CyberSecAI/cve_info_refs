- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape the Form Title, allowing high-privilege users to inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the Form Title. These scripts can be executed when a user views or edits the form within the admin dashboard, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Title" field of a form settings within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges (e.g., admin) to be able to create a new form and modify its settings.
