- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ProfilePress plugin failed to sanitize or escape certain settings before saving them and outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high privilege user, such as an admin, can inject JavaScript payloads into plugin settings, leading to arbitrary script execution in the context of other users' browsers who view the affected pages.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with high-privilege access (such as admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Edit Account Endpoint' or 'Change Password Endpoint' fields within the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) within the WordPress environment to access and modify the vulnerable plugin settings.
