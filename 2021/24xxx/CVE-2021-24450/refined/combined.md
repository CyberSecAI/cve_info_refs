## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ProfilePress < 3.1.8 - Authenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin did not sanitise or escape some of its settings before saving them and outputting them back in the page, allowing high privilege users such as admin to set JavaScript payloads in them even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed, leading to an authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the 'Edit Account Endpoint' or 'Change Password Endpoint' fields in the General > My Account plugin's settings: "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
