{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The AJAX action `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` in the `settings-start-index.php` file of multiple WP-Buy plugins does not properly validate user privileges, allowing low-privileged users to trigger plugin installation and activation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Access Control",
    "Arbitrary Plugin Installation",
    "Arbitrary Plugin Activation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can install and activate arbitrary plugins, including vulnerable ones, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and other critical vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, using the `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` AJAX action.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with an active session (e.g., subscriber) on the target WordPress site."
