Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `edit` parameter in the `admin.php?page=events` URL is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization, validation, or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the database (as demonstrated by the example using `SELECT user(),user(),current_user()`).
*   Depending on the database setup and user privileges, the attacker might be able to modify or delete data.
*   Full database compromise if the web application user has sufficient database privileges
*   The impact can be severe, leading to data breaches, system compromise, and unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint with a malicious `edit` parameter.
*  Specifically, `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=events&edit=[malicious SQL here]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or higher to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `timeline.php` at line 263:
    ```php
    $eid = $_GET['edit'];
    $load = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT day, month, event FROM ".TABLE_NAME." WHERE id = $eid");
    ```
*  The PoC shows the injection of the SQL statement `UNION ALL SELECT user(),user(),current_user()--`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also indicates the plugin is closed, and there is no known fix.
*  The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.6
*  The exploit requires an admin-level authenticated user.
