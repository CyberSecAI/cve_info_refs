Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Elementor plugin did not properly validate HTML tags for several of its elements (Column, Accordion, Icon Box, Image Box, Heading, and Divider) on the server side. This allowed users with access to the Elementor editor to inject arbitrary HTML tags, including `<script>` tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code injected into the HTML tags is stored in the database and executed when other users view, edit, or preview the affected posts/pages.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin lacked proper server-side input validation for HTML tags, relying on client-side validation which could easily be bypassed.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:**  While some elements escaped output, other elements did not, and even escaping was sometimes insufficient (e.g., heading text nested within the `header_size` tags).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Site Takeover:** If an administrator views a post containing malicious JavaScript, the attacker could use the administrator's session to create a new malicious administrator account, add a backdoor, or perform other actions that lead to site takeover.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with contributor-level access to the Elementor editor could exploit the vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript that could compromise other user's accounts with higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Requests:** Attackers could craft requests to modify the `html_tag` parameter of affected elements to inject malicious javascript.
*   **Elementor Editor Access:**  Exploitation required access to the Elementor editor, typically available to users with at least contributor-level privileges.
*   **Malicious Post/Page Content:** The injected JavaScript would be stored in posts/pages, impacting other users who viewed, edited, or previewed them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** Attackers need a WordPress user account with at least contributor-level privileges or higher.
*   **Elementor Editor Access:**  The user account must be able to access the Elementor editor to add and modify content using the vulnerable elements.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:**  The attacker needed to be aware of the vulnerable `html_tag` parameters of the specified Elementor elements.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Wordfence article highlights the importance of both input validation and output escaping to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability was present in the free version of Elementor.
*   The issue was patched in Elementor version 3.1.4.
*   The provided proof of concept shows how to inject a script tag into the divider element.
