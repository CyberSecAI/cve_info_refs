- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly escape some of its settings before outputting them in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be an administrator (or a high privileged user) who can access the plugin's settings page. The attacker inserts the malicious script into the "Category Plural Label", "Category Plural Label" or "Label Plural Label" fields within the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires administrative or high-privilege access to the WordPress dashboard.
