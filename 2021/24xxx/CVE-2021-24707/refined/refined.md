- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Email PDT identity token settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: High privilege users can perform cross-site scripting attacks, even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker with administrative privileges can access the PayPal settings under the Learning Plugin.
    - The attacker injects an XSS payload into the "Email PDT identity token" field.
    - After saving the changes, the XSS is triggered upon visiting the Import/Export tab.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privilege access (Admin+) to access the settings and inject the malicious payload.
