- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper access controls for the `save_all_order` AJAX action and fails to validate and escape user-supplied data before inserting it into an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi), Improper Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user (e.g., a subscriber) can modify arbitrary post content, potentially injecting XSS payloads. Also, they can exfiltrate data by copying it to another post.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `save_all_order` and injecting malicious SQL code in the `sort_orders` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least the 'subscriber' role.
