{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize or escape form values before saving to the database or when outputting.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "High privilege users can perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed. This can lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the 'wats_select_ticket_type', 'wats_select_ticket_priority', and 'wats_select_ticket_status' parameters when creating or updating a ticket. The XSS payload is then triggered when a user views the ticket.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be a high privilege user (e.g., administrator) to create/modify tickets."
