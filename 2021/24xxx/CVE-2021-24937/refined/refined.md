- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `wpacu_selected_sub_tab_area` parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute on an admin page. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the admin page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or other malicious activities when a victim visits the crafted URL.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious payload in the `wpacu_selected_sub_tab_area` parameter. This malicious code is then reflected back in the page's HTML source code and executed by the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user (likely an administrator) into clicking the link while being logged into the WordPress admin panel.
