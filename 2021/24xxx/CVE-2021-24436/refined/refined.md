Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24436:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the "extension" parameter within the W3 Total Cache plugin's Extensions dashboard. Specifically, the value of this parameter is output directly into an HTML attribute without being encoded first.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript through the "extension" parameter, which is then reflected back in the response, causing the victim's browser to execute the malicious code.
- **Unescaped Output:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly encode or escape user-supplied input before including it in an HTML attribute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser.
- **Full Site Compromise:** This can potentially lead to full site compromise as an attacker could gain control of the administrative user's session. They could create new admin users, modify content, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the "extension" parameter of the w3tc_extensions admin page.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince an authenticated administrator to click the specially crafted malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in the "extension" parameter.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting the malicious URL.
- **No Direct Access Required**: The attacker does not need direct access to the WordPress instance.

**Additional Information:**
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.1.4 of the W3 Total Cache plugin.
- **CVSS Score:** The provided CVSS score is 9.6 (Critical), indicating a high severity vulnerability.
- **Proof of Concept:** A proof-of-concept URL is given as an example, demonstrating the vulnerability.
