- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape the Image ALT setting before outputting it as an HTML attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Image ALT field, which can then be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view the plugin's settings page or the frontend of the website, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the Image ALT setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator or higher privileges to modify the Image ALT setting.
