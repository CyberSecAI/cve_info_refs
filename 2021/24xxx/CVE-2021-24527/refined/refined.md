Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24527:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Profile Builder plugin handles password reset keys. Specifically, the password reset key is checked against the password recovery key, but it's processed using `sanitize_text_field`. This function strips HTML tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:**  The core weakness is an authentication bypass that allows an attacker to reset the administrator's password without proper authorization.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The use of `sanitize_text_field` and its stripping of HTML tags is a weakness because the logic after this sanitization uses an `empty()` check. The fact that `sanitize_text_field` strips the HTML, and the application then checks if the key is empty is the root cause.
- **Lack of Email Notification:** The admin user does not receive a notification when their password is changed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain full administrative access to the WordPress site by resetting the admin password.
- **Complete Control:** With admin access, attackers can modify content, install malicious plugins, and perform any other administrative task, leading to complete compromise of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack is network based and involves sending a specially crafted request to the WordPress site's password reset page.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URL by adding a `?key=<a>` parameter to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Password Reset Page Abuse:** The vulnerability is exploited through the password reset functionality of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need to have any existing credentials or access to the site.
- **Access to Password Reset Page:** The attacker must be able to access the password reset page of the Profile Builder plugin.
- **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate a URL.

**Summary**
The vulnerability in Profile Builder allows an unauthenticated attacker to reset the administrator's password by exploiting a flaw in the password reset process. The sanitization function strips HTML which passes an empty check and allows a reset. This grants the attacker complete control over the WordPress site.
