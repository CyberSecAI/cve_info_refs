Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24366

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The `Admin Columns` plugin for WordPress fails to properly sanitize and escape the "Label" settings for custom column fields. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts within these labels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the input provided for the "Label" field when creating or updating admin columns.
- **Improper Output Escaping:** The plugin does not escape the output of the "Label" field before rendering it on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page/post.
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** The injected JavaScript code can perform various actions, including but not limited to:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Panel:** The attacker must access the WordPress admin panel.
- **Plugin Settings:** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin settings page for "Admin Columns" when adding or editing a custom column.
- **Label field:** The malicious script is injected into the "Label" text field when creating a custom admin column.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges such as admin capabilities.
- **Admin Access:**  The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin dashboard.
- **Plugin usage:** The attacker must be able to access the Admin Columns plugin settings page.
- **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting a malicious JavaScript payload.

**Additional Notes:**
