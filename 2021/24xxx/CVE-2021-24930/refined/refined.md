- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize the Staff Full Name field before outputting it back to the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A low privilege user (Staff Member) injects malicious script into the Full Name field within their profile. An admin user then triggers the XSS when viewing the staff member order page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have a Staff Member account in the WordPress site.
    - They must be able to edit their profile.
    - The attacker relies on an admin user to visit the vulnerable page.
