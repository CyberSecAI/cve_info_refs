- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate its User Field Titles, allowing XSS payloads to be injected. Additionally, there are no CSRF or capability checks in place.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Lack of CSRF protection
    - Missing capability checks
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who visit the affected pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can submit a crafted POST request containing the malicious payload in the `fieldtitle` parameter to the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=jslm_fieldordering&task=saveuserfield` endpoint. This can be done by exploiting the lack of CSRF protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require authentication, or any specific privileges, to inject the malicious payload. The XSS payload is triggered when an administrator visits the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=jslm_fieldordering&ff=3` page.
