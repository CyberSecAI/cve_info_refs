Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `mwp-forms` WordPress plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape the `did` GET parameter before using it in a SQL query. This occurs in the form deletion functionality within the admin dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `did` parameter.
*   **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:** The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker can infer information based on the time the database takes to respond.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   The attacker could potentially modify or delete data, disrupt application functionality, or compromise the entire WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a GET request to the WordPress admin panel.
*   **`did` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `did` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to exploit this vulnerability since it resides in the admin dashboard.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `admin/partials/main.php` at line 13:
    ```php
    $delid = $_GET["did"];
    $wpdb->query("delete from " . $data . " where id=" . $delid);
    ```
*   The `$delid` variable is taken directly from the GET request and is then directly included in the SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the time-based blind SQL injection.
*   SQLmap command is provided to automate exploitation of SQL injection.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Shreya Pohekar of Codevigilant Project.
*   The affected versions are `3.1.3` and potentially earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
*   CVSS score is 7.6 (High).
*   There's no known fix for the vulnerability at the time of this analysis.
