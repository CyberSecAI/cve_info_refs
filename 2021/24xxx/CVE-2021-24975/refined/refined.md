Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of logged requests before they are outputted in the plugin's admin dashboard. Specifically, the plugin fails to use `htmlentities` when outputting the `msg` and `extInfo` fields of log entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored in the database (through the log) and then executed when a user views the log. The XSS is unauthenticated, meaning that any user can trigger it, not just an admin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the admin dashboard's log viewer. When an administrator views the log, this script will execute within their browser session.
*   This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the admin panel
    *   Privilege escalation if the admin interacts with the malicious script
    *   Data exfiltration

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request that is logged by the plugin.
*   An attacker can send a request to the website with a malicious script in the `x-tomato` header. This request will be logged, and the script will be stored in the log.
*   The XSS is triggered when an admin views the log page `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nxs-log`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.3.24 of the "Social Networks Auto-Poster" plugin.
*   The vulnerable code was located in `inc/nxs_class_snap.php` on line 806.
*   The fix involved using `htmlentities()` function when outputting log message and extra information.
*   The provided PoC involves using curl to send an HTTP request with a malicious script in the `x-tomato` header: `curl -H 'x-tomato: <script>alert(/XSS/);</script>' 'https://example.com/?nxs-cronrun=yes'`
