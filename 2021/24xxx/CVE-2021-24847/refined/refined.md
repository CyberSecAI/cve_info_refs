{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `importFromRedirection` AJAX action of the plugin does not properly sanitize the `offset` parameter before using it in a SQL statement.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `importFromRedirection` and a malicious `offset` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user (at least a subscriber)."
