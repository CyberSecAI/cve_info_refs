Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability and CSRF checks within the `wpr_live_update` AJAX action in the WP Responsive Menu plugin. Additionally, the plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape some of the submitted data, allowing for injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Capability Checks:** The plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the action.
*   **Missing CSRF Protection:** There is no check to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Insufficient Data Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided data before using it, enabling injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will be executed whenever a user visits a frontend page, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Stealing sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed by sending a POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Exploitation Method:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload that includes JavaScript code and sends it via the `wpr_live_update` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user, even a subscriber, which typically has limited privileges, can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how a user can send a malicious payload to the `wpr_live_update` endpoint to inject JavaScript.
*   The injected XSS will be triggered on the frontend of the website
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.1.7.1 of the plugin.
