### Summary:
The provided content describes a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Registration Magic WordPress plugin, specifically versions prior to 5.0.1.9. This vulnerability arises due to the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape the `rm_search_value` parameter before outputting it within an attribute.

### Vulnerability Details:
- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of the `rm_search_value` parameter when it is displayed in an attribute.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which will then be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL with the malicious script in the `rm_search_value` parameter.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker can be unauthenticated, and would need to craft the malicious URL, and trick a user into visiting it.

### Technical Details:
The vulnerability is located in the `rm_login_advanced` page of the WordPress admin panel. The `rm_search_value` parameter is vulnerable.

- **Vulnerable versions:** < 5.0.1.9
- **Example PoC URLs:**
  -  `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rm_login_advanced&rm_search_value="><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`
  -  `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rm_login_advanced&rm_search_value="%20style=animation-name:rotation%20onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//`
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.0.1.9. The fix involved sanitizing the `rm_search_value` parameter before outputting it.
