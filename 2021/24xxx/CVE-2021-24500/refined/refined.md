The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Workreap theme, including CSRF and IDOR issues, and an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability. However, the CVE ID specified in the prompt (CVE-2021-24500) only relates to the CSRF and IDOR vulnerabilities.

**CVE-2021-24500**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The theme lacks CSRF protection on several AJAX actions, and also allows insecure direct object references (IDOR) without proper validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): AJAX actions do not have CSRF protection.
    *   Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): The theme does not validate object references allowing access to unauthorized resources/data
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in user to submit a POST request to the vulnerable site, potentially modifying or deleting arbitrary objects.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   CSRF: Tricking a logged-in user into submitting a crafted POST request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints.
    *   IDOR: Directly manipulating object IDs in requests.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged in user into performing a request.

The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a CSRF attack, demonstrating how a malicious form can be used to trigger a `workreap_portfolio_remove` action, but it also notes that the ID value can be any valid post ID, emphasizing the IDOR vulnerability as well.
