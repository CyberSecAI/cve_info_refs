Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24001

**Description:**
A compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations.

**Root Cause:**
Testing code for passing session history index and length between parent and child processes was not properly restricted to testing environments. This allowed a compromised content process to send session history update messages which should not have been possible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper access control: Testing functionality was exposed outside of testing environments.
- Vulnerable message handling: The `ContentParent::RecvSessionHistoryUpdate` message handler was not intended to be used by untrusted content processes.
- Session history manipulation: A compromised process could send messages to manipulate the session history.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session history manipulation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. This could be used to trick users in combination with other vulnerabilities.
- While no specific out-of-bounds write or arbitrary code execution is mentioned here, the ability to manipulate session history from a compromised content process is a security issue. The impact is classified as "moderate" by Mozilla.
- As noted in the bug report, this vulnerability might be more severe in a Fission enabled browser, but it's not explicitely confirmed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A compromised content process sends a `SessionHistoryUpdate` message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to compromise a content process within a browsing context group. This could be achieved using a different exploit.
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the parent process.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code was intended for testing purposes but was unintentionally left in non-testing builds.
- The fix involves removing the testing code, thus preventing arbitrary session history manipulations by content processes.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 88.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
A testing feature for manipulating session history was inadvertently available in production builds of Firefox. This feature could be exploited by a compromised content process to manipulate the session history, potentially causing unexpected behaviour. The vulnerability was addressed by removing this functionality from production builds.
