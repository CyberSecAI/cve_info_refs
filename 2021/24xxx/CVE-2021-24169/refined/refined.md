  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'tab' parameter in the Admin Panel of the Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce plugin was vulnerable to reflected XSS due to insufficient sanitization of user input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the affected parameter. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a script in the 'tab' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the affected admin page. The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to click the crafted link."
