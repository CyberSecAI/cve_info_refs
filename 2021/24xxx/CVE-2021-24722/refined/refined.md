- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape inputs when creating new menu items.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they visit affected pages, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A high privilege user can inject XSS payloads into the menu item fields (Nutrition Facts and Portion Size) when creating a new menu item via the WordPress admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with high privileges (e.g., administrator) to create new menu items.
