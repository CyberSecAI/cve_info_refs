- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF checks when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can make logged-in administrators change the plugin settings to arbitrary values.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, modifies the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting the malicious form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
