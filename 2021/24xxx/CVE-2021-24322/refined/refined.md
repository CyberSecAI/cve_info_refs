- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `backup_recipient` POST parameter before outputting it within an HTML tag attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of output escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view the vulnerable page, leading to actions such as cookie theft or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user with administrative privileges can send a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/tools.php?page=wp-db-backup` endpoint, injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `backup_recipient` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator of the WordPress site to access the vulnerable page.
