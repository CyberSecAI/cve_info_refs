Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-24171:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from inadequate sanitization of file names during upload in the WooCommerce Upload Files plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** The plugin attempts to remove blocked file extensions (like .php) from the uploaded file name but does so with a single pass of string replacement. This allows attackers to bypass the sanitization by embedding blocked extensions within each other (e.g., `shell.p.phphp` becomes `shell.php`).
*   **Directory Traversal:** The `wcuf_current_upload_session_id` parameter, which is used in the file path construction, is not sanitized, allowing directory traversal attacks (e.g., `../../../../file`).
*   **Double Extension Attack:** Combining the lack of sanitization with path traversal allows for double extension attacks by manipulating the `wcuf_current_upload_session_id` parameter in a way that results in a file with a PHP extension (e.g., `info.php._test`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to upload arbitrary PHP files to the server.
*   **Complete Website Takeover:** With RCE, an attacker can gain full control of the affected website and potentially any other websites hosted on the same server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The vulnerability is present in a publicly accessible AJAX function (`ajax_manage_file_chunk_upload`).
*   **Manipulated POST Parameters:** Attackers craft malicious HTTP POST requests by manipulating parameters such as `wcuf_file_name` and `wcuf_current_upload_session_id`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need any login credentials or prior access.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was a zero-day vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was quickly patched by the plugin developer.
*   Wordfence premium users received firewall protection the same day, free users received it 30 days later.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a critical severity issue (CVSS score of 9.8).

This information aligns with the description of CVE-2021-24171 which is an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability leading to remote code execution in the WooCommerce Upload Files Plugin.
