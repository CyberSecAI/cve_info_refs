- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize or escape the 's' GET parameter before outputting it on the "All Masking Rules" page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of output sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This could lead to session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL that includes the JavaScript payload in the 's' parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to lure a user to click a malicious URL, usually by social engineering or by embedding the URL in a malicious website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
