Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of HTML tags within the "The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder Lite" plugin. Specifically, four widgets within this plugin ("Accordion", "Infobox", "Heading animation", and "Hovercard") allow users to specify HTML tags for titles or other text elements. The plugin does not enforce server-side restrictions on these tags, allowing for arbitrary tags, including the `<script>` tag, to be saved and rendered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the vulnerable HTML tag parameters of the widgets and gets stored in the database. This code is then executed when a page containing the crafted element is viewed, edited, or previewed by other users.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize or validate the input provided for the HTML tag parameters, allowing arbitrary HTML tags, including `<script>` tags.
*   **Insufficient Output Encoding:** The plugin outputs the stored HTML tag values without proper escaping, causing the browser to interpret and execute the injected JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Site Takeover:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page. If an administrator views this page, the JavaScript code would execute within their browser session. This would allow the attacker to potentially perform actions on the site with the administrator's privileges, including taking over the entire website.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with contributor-level access can inject the malicious code. When an administrator reviews the content, the attacker can escalate their privileges.
*   **Data Theft and Manipulation:** The injected JavaScript could also be used to steal sensitive data (e.g., cookies, session tokens) or manipulate the website content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network by sending crafted HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Direct Input:** An attacker needs to have access to the WordPress editor, at least with contributor privileges, to add/modify content and inject the malicious HTML tags into the vulnerable widgets.
*   **Widget Parameters:** Attackers inject malicious tags through the following parameters:
    *   Accordion Widget: "title\_html\_tag"
    *   Infobox Widget: "title\_tag"
    *   Heading animation Widget: "ani\_title\_tag"
    *   Hovercard Widget: "open\_tag"

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** An attacker needs a WordPress account with at least "contributor" privileges. This level of access allows the user to create/edit content and use the Elementor page builder.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker must know that the "The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder Lite" plugin is installed and vulnerable (versions < 2.0.6).
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and HTTP requests to inject malicious scripts.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.0.6 of the plugin.
*   The provided sources indicate that the same vulnerability pattern was found in multiple Elementor addon plugins, likely due to the use of insecure code examples in Elementor's developer documentation.
*   Wordfence firewall users (including free users) were protected against these vulnerabilities since March 25, 2021, through a firewall rule created for the original Elementor vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score of 6.8 (medium) was assigned by wpscan.com
*   The CVSS vector is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) according to wpscan.com
*   The CVSS score of 6.4 (Medium) was assigned by wordfence.com, with the vector [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
