Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24216

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The All-in-One WP Migration plugin versions before 7.41 failed to properly validate the extension of uploaded files during the import process. This lack of validation allows an attacker with administrative privileges to upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin does not check the file extension of the uploaded file, allowing the upload of files with extensions like `.php`.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There is insufficient validation of the uploaded file within the import functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file containing malicious code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. This allows for complete compromise of the WordPress site.
- **Site Takeover:** An attacker with RCE can take full control of the affected website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the import functionality of the plugin. An administrator logs in and uses the import from file function.
- The attacker intercepts the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ai1wm_import&ai1wm_import=1` request.
- The attacker modifies the parameters of "upload-file", "storage" and "archive", inserting malicious PHP code into "upload-file". The modified request is then submitted.
- Finally, the attacker accesses the uploaded PHP file via `wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/storage/[storage]/[archive]` to execute system commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker must have administrative-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Network Interception (Optional):**  While not strictly required for exploitation, the provided PoC uses interception to modify the import request. An attacker could potentially craft a similar malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content from wpscan.com details a Proof of Concept (PoC) that includes the exact steps for exploiting the vulnerability, including the modified POST request and the malicious PHP code injected into the upload file.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.41 of the plugin.
- This vulnerability can affect both single and multi-site WordPress installations.
- The fix primarily focuses on adding validation for file extensions during the upload process, specifically verifying that the uploaded file is a '.wpress' archive.
