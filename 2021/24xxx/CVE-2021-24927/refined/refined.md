  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape the callback parameter of the mc_post_lookup AJAX action before outputting it in the response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the callback parameter of the mc_post_lookup AJAX action.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, with at least subscriber level privileges. They need to craft a malicious URL and convince a victim to click on it."
