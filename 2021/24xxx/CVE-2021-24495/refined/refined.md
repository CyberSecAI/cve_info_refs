**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Marmoset Viewer plugin did not properly sanitize, validate, or escape the 'id' parameter before outputting it back into the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input sanitization and output encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially leading to:
    - Theft of cookies or credentials.
    - Account takeover of a victim.
    - Stealing other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
By crafting a malicious payload and appending it to the 'id' parameter within the plugin's URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload, and then entice a victim to click that link, or otherwise load it in their browser. No specific authentication or authorization is needed.
