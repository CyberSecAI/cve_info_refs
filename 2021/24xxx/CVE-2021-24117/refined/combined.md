# The Rust SGX SDK Standard Library
The Rust SGX standard library (previously named as `sgx\_tstdc`) is
the foundation of portable Rust SGX SDK, a
set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the Rust SGX
ecosystem. Similar to Rust's libstd, it offers core types, like [`Vec`] and
[`Option`], library-defined [operations on language
primitives](#primitives), [standard macros](#macros), [I/O] and
[multithreading], among [many other things][other].
`std` is available to all Rust crates by default, just as if each one
contained an `extern crate sgx\_tstd as std;` import at the [crate root]. Therefore the
standard library can be accessed in [`use`] statements through the path
`std`, as in [`use std::env`], or in expressions through the absolute path
`::std`, as in [`::std::env::args`].

# Vulnerability information for CVE-2021-24119

* **CVEID**: CVE-2021-24119
* **PRODUCT**: Mbed TLS
* **VERSION**: Fixed in 2.26.0
* **PROBLEM TYPE**: Side-Channel Vulnerability in base64 decoding
* **DESCRIPTION**: Mbed TLS before the version 2.26.0 uses a non-constant time
  implementation for base64 decoding. Essentially, the usage of
  a lookup table in decoding keys stored as PEM files, allows an
  attacker to obtain key information by tracking the accessed
  cache lines during key decoding. The attack was demonstrated in
  Intel SGX.

  Mbed TLS fixed the issue in version 2.26.0.

# Vulnerability information for CVE-2021-24116

* **CVEID**: CVE-2021-24116
* **PRODUCT**: WolfSSL
* **VERSION**: Fixed in 4.6.0
* **PROBLEM TYPE**: Side-Channel Vulnerability in base64 decoding
* **DESCRIPTION**: WolfSSL before the version 4.6.0 uses a non-constant time
  implementation for base64 decoding. Essentially, the usage of
  a lookup table in decoding keys stored as PEM files, allows an
  attacker to obtain key information by tracking the accessed
  cache lines during key decoding. The attack was demonstrated in
  Intel SGX.

  WolfSSL fixed the issue in version 4.6.0.

# Vulnerability information for CVE-2021-24117

* **CVEID**: CVE-2021-24117
* **PRODUCT**: Rust SGX
* **VERSION**: Vulnerable in v1.1.3
* **PROBLEM TYPE**: Side-Channel Vulnerability in base64 decoding
* **DESCRIPTION**: Rust SGX before and in the version v1.1.3 uses a non-constant time
  implementation for base64 decoding. Essentially, the usage of
  a lookup table in decoding keys stored as PEM files, allows an
  attacker to obtain key information by tracking the accessed
  cache lines during key decoding. The attack was demonstrated in
  Intel SGX.

  The issue is about to be fixed in the rust-base64 module:
