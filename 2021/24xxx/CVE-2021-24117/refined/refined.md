      "product": "Rust SGX",
      "affected_version": "v1.1.3",
      "problem_type": "Side-Channel Vulnerability in base64 decoding",
      "description": "Rust SGX before and in the version v1.1.3 uses a non-constant time implementation for base64 decoding. Essentially, the usage of a lookup table in decoding keys stored as PEM files, allows an attacker to obtain key information by tracking the accessed cache lines during key decoding. The attack was demonstrated in Intel SGX.",
      "root_cause": "Non-constant time implementation of base64 decoding using a lookup table.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Side-channel vulnerability due to cache timing variations during base64 decoding."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially extract key information by monitoring cache line access patterns during base64 decoding of PEM files.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Monitoring cache line access patterns during base64 decoding."
