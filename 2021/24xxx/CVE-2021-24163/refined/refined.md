Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2021-24163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `wp_ajax_ninja_forms_sendwp_remote_install` AJAX action of the Ninja Forms plugin. This action is responsible for installing and activating the SendWP plugin.
*   The primary issue is the lack of proper access control:
    *   **No capability check:** The code does not verify if the user initiating the AJAX request has the necessary permissions to perform plugin installation.
    *   **No nonce protection:** The request isn't protected with a nonce, which is a security token to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure AJAX Action:** The `wp_ajax_ninja_forms_sendwp_remote_install` action is accessible to unprivileged users (like subscribers), allowing them to trigger the installation and activation of the SendWP plugin.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The AJAX response includes the `client_secret` key for SendWP, which is sensitive information that should not be exposed to low-level users.
*   **Plugin Installation and Activation Vulnerability:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to install and activate a plugin of their choosing by using the `wp_ajax_ninja_forms_sendwp_remote_install` action to install the `sendwp` plugin

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Mail Interception:** By obtaining the SendWP `client_secret` key, an attacker can connect the compromised WordPress site to their own SendWP account. This allows them to intercept and log all emails sent by the WordPress site, including password reset emails and form submissions containing PII.
*   **Potential Account Takeover:** By intercepting password reset emails, an attacker could potentially gain administrative access to the site and further compromise it by modifying theme/plugin files or uploading malicious files.
*   **Installation of Malicious Plugin**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to install the `sendwp` plugin which they could use as a backdoor into the system

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct AJAX Call:** An attacker can directly send an AJAX request to the vulnerable endpoint (`wp_ajax_ninja_forms_sendwp_remote_install`).
*   **Low-Privilege Access:** This vulnerability can be exploited by users with subscriber-level access or above on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker must have a registered account on the vulnerable WordPress site, even a low-level account like a subscriber.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes**

*   The Wordfence article details that the SendWP service costs money for each site. As a result it is less likely to be widely exploited.
*   The provided PoC code demonstrates how an attacker could retrieve the client secret and generate the form required to connect the victim's site to an attacker's SendWP account
*   The wpscan content mentions that this vulnerability is classified as a SENSITIVE DATA DISCLOSURE, an OWASP A3 violation, and CWE-200

This vulnerability is rated as **Critical** with a CVSS score of 9.9 due to the potential for complete site takeover.
