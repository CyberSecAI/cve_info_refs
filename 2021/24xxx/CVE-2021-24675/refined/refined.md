Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24675:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The "One User Avatar" WordPress plugin does not implement proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection when updating a user's avatar through the `[avatar_upload]` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The plugin lacks nonce verification or other CSRF prevention mechanisms for avatar updates initiated through the shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Avatar Modification:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to change their avatar to an arbitrary image by tricking them into submitting a crafted request.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF Attack:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that automatically submits an avatar update request when a logged-in user visits the page. This form is submitted without the user's knowledge or explicit consent.
-  The attacker leverages the lack of CSRF protection to make the victim's browser send a request to the WordPress site to change the user's avatar.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Attacker Position:** The attacker can be external to the application, they just need to host a malicious HTML page.
- **Attacker Capabilities:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to host an HTML page that can be viewed by the victim.
    - The attacker does not require any authenticated session, other than the session of the victim when they visit the malicious page.
- **Victim Condition:** The victim must be logged into their WordPress account on the same browser.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can create a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in user, submits an avatar update request with an arbitrary image.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.3.7 of the "One User Avatar" plugin.
- The vulnerability is classified as a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 3.1 (Low).
