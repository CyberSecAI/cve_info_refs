- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `create_post_page` AJAX action in the Custom Post View Generator plugin doesn't sanitize or escape user input before outputting it in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=create_postpage` parameter, and including malicious JavaScript in the `object_type` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. This is available to authenticated users.
