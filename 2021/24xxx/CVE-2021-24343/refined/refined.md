- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The iFlyChat plugin does not sanitize the "APP ID" setting before outputting it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the plugin settings page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "APP ID" field of the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress site to modify the plugin's settings.
