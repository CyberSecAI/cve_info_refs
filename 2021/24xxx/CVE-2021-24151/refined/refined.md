- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin did not sanitize or validate its settings fields, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated (admin+) blind SQL injection via an arbitrary parameter when making a request to save settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate database queries, leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious request to save the plugin's settings, including a specially crafted payload within a parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or higher privileged user to exploit this vulnerability.
