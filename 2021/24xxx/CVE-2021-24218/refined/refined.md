Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-24218:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `wp_ajax_save_fbe_settings` and `wp_ajax_delete_fbe_settings` AJAX actions in the Facebook for WordPress plugin lacked nonce protection, making them vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally, the `saveFbeSettings` function did not sanitize the input, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript into the plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF:** The plugin's AJAX actions for saving and deleting settings did not implement nonce verification, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated administrator.
*   **Stored XSS:** The lack of sanitization of input in the `saveFbeSettings` function allowed an attacker to save malicious JavaScript code within the plugin's settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **CSRF to Settings Modification:** Attackers could modify the plugin settings by tricking an administrator into clicking a malicious link, potentially redirecting data to an attacker-controlled Facebook Pixel account and stealing metrics.
*   **CSRF to Stored XSS:** Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings, which would then execute in an administrator's browser when they viewed the settings page, leading to site takeover, backdoor injection, and the creation of malicious admin accounts.
*   **CSRF to Settings Deletion:** Attackers could erase plugin settings, causing a brief loss of metric data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   An attacker would need to craft a malicious HTML form or link that triggers the vulnerable AJAX actions.
*   The attack requires an authenticated administrator to interact with the malicious form while logged into the target WordPress site.
*   The crafted form can be submitted by a user via any vector that allows the injection of HTML into a user's browser (e.g. email, malicious website, etc).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker does not need prior access to the WordPress site, but they need to be able to trick a logged-in administrator user into performing an action.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create malicious HTML or links.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges, as the attack relies on exploiting the administratorâ€™s existing session.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was present in the Facebook for WordPress plugin versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.3.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.0.4.
*   The Wordfence blog post provides a detailed explanation of how the vulnerability works, along with the proof of concept code.
* The Wordfence blog also explains that this vulnerability was discovered in combination with another vulnerability, a PHP Object Injection (CVE-2021-24217), which enabled remote code execution. This vulnerability was fixed in version 3.0.0 of the plugin, although it was present in earlier versions.
