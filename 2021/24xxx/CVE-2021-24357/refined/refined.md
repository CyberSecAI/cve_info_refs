- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the Custom CSS field of each gallery before outputting it on the page where the gallery is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the Custom CSS field, which will then be executed in the browsers of users viewing the affected galleries. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, phishing, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have the ability to edit the gallery settings. They insert the malicious payload into the custom CSS field. When a user views the page with the gallery, the script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least an authenticated user account with privileges to edit galleries.
