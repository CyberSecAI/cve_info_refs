Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Astra Pro Addon plugin prior to version 3.5.2 did not properly sanitize or escape some POST parameters from the `astra_pagination_infinite` and `astra_shop_pagination_infinite` AJAX actions before using them in SQL statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):**  Unsanitized input in the `query_vars` parameter of the AJAX actions allowed for arbitrary SQL code to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially manipulate the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
-  This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially complete compromise of the WordPress database. The specific impact can vary based on the attacker's objectives.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST requests** to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable actions `astra_pagination_infinite` and `astra_shop_pagination_infinite`.
-  The vulnerable parameters are within the `query_vars` which is a JSON string containing a `tax_query`.
-  The `terms` array within the `tax_query` is vulnerable

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the specified endpoint with a payload crafted to inject SQL.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
- The exploit was originally researched by Ngoc Nguyen.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
- The CVSS score is 8.6 (High).
- Proof-of-concept code is provided for both vulnerable actions to demonstrate both error-based and boolean-based SQL injection.
