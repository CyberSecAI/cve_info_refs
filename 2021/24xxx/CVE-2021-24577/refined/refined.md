- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize inputs submitted by authenticated users when adding or modifying coming soon or maintenance mode pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will be executed when an administrator accesses the settings page or when a user visits the affected coming soon/maintenance pages. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser, potentially resulting in session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the capability to modify the plugin settings, then inject the XSS payload into the "Title" field and save the settings. The malicious code will be stored in the database. The XSS payload gets executed when the settings page is accessed again, or when the coming soon/maintenance page is accessed by users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the capability to modify the plugin settings, specifically with the ability to access and change the "Title" setting of the plugin.
