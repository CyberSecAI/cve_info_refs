# Coming Soon and Maintenance Mode < 3.5.3 - Authenticated Stored XSS

\* Click on the "Title" section
\* Inject XSS payload into the Title section's "Title" form field.
<!'/\*"/\*/'/\*/"/\*--></Script><Image SrcSet=K \*/; OnError=confirm`123` //>
\* Click "Save Section", then reload the settings page (Coming Soon -> Coming Soon)
