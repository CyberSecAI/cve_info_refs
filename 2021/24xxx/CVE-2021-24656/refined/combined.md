## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Social Media Share Buttons < 3.2.4 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape the Share Title settings before outputting it in the frontend pages or posts (depending on the settings used), allowing high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload <svg onload=alert(/XSS/)> in the Share Title settings of the plugin (with at least one Social Buttons Designs enabled)
The XSS will be triggered depending on the Post type Settings selected (like just homepage, posts, pages etc)
