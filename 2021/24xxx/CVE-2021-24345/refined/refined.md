Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24345

**Root Cause:** The `id_lista` POST parameter, used in the `lists-management` page, is not sanitized, validated, or escaped before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `id_lista` parameter. The injection is blind, meaning the attacker does not receive direct feedback from the database, but can infer the results based on timing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database, due to the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The specific impact is not detailed further, but the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands can lead to a wide variety of issues, including complete database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=lists-management` endpoint.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `id_lista` within the request body

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable File:** `admin-core.php`
*   **Vulnerable Code:** The code snippet provided in `admin-core.php#L110` shows that the `$_POST['id_lista']` is directly inserted into an SQL query without sanitization.
    ```php
    $ins= $wpdb->query("delete from $table_liste where id_lista = $_POST[id_lista]");
    ```
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can use time-based blind SQL injection to confirm the vulnerability.
*   **SQLmap:** The provided SQLmap command shows how to identify and exploit the injection point.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.6 (Medium), with vectors AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L.
