- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin did not sanitize the login error message before outputting it back in the login form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the login page. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `login-error` parameter and tricking a victim into visiting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker doesn't need any authentication or special privileges and the vulnerability can be exploited with default plugin configuration. The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on a specially crafted link.
