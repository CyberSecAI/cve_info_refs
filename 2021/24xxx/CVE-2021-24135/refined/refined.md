  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WP Customer Reviews plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the review detail page or within post edit forms.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code or HTML that is executed when an admin user accesses the review detail page or when editing a post.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vectors include: \n  - Unauthenticated users injecting malicious code through review form fields (Reviewer Name, Website, Review Title).\n  - Authenticated low-privileged users (Author) injecting malicious code via post edit form fields (Business Name, Street Address, City, Country etc for business reviews and Product Name, Brand for product reviews).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated attacker needs to be able to submit the review form while an authenticated low-privileged user requires access to the post edit page."
