Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of proper server-side sanitization and validation of HTML tag parameters in multiple widgets of the "JetWidgets For Elementor" plugin. The plugin allows users to select HTML tags from a dropdown menu, but these selections are not enforced, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into various widget parameters, which is then stored in the database and executed when the affected page is viewed.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the parameters controlling HTML tags, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The widget parameters `title_html_tag`, `sub_title_html_tag`, `header_size`, `services_title_size`, and `member_name_html_tag`, are vulnerable as they allow injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code in the browsers of other users who view, edit, or preview pages containing the injected code.
*   **Site Takeover:** If an administrator views a page with the malicious code, the attacker can potentially take over the site via session hijacking or other means.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A lower-privileged user, such as a contributor, can inject the malicious code, which can then be used to perform privilege escalation if an administrator reviews or edits the affected page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Widget Parameters:** Attackers exploit vulnerable widget parameters to inject malicious code.
*   **`save_builder` Request:** Attackers can send a `save_builder` request with malicious HTML tag parameters, bypassing the client-side dropdown limitation.
*   **HTML Tag Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the HTML tag parameters, setting them to `<script>` tags, or directly injecting JavaScript in the title parameter, or injecting code via remotely sourced scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account with Contributor Role or Higher:** The attacker needs a WordPress account with at least contributor privileges, which provides the ability to access the Elementor editor.
*   **Ability to Access Elementor Editor:** The attacker needs to be able to access and use the Elementor editor to create or modify pages.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in "JetWidgets For Elementor" plugin versions before 1.0.9.
*   The same vulnerability pattern was present across multiple Elementor add-on plugins.
*   A similar vulnerability was previously found in the main Elementor plugin.
*   The Wordfence firewall has a rule to protect against this XSS, available to free users since March 25, 2021.
