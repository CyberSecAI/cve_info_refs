- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin did not sanitize or escape the `lyte_yt_api_key` and `lyte_notification` settings before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges (e.g., administrator) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to the `/wp-admin/options.php` endpoint with malicious payloads within the `lyte_yt_api_key` or `lyte_notification` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges, such as an administrator, to modify the plugin's settings.
