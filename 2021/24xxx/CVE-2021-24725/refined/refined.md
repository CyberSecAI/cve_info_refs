Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-24725:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The WordPress plugin "Comment Link Remove and Other Comment Tools" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in its comment deletion functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The plugin does not validate that the comment deletion request originates from a legitimate user action within the application, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Comment Deletion: An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete arbitrary comments on the WordPress site without their consent or awareness.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious link or webpage could be crafted by the attacker and sent to a logged-in administrator.
- When the administrator clicks on the link or visits the malicious page, it would send a request to the vulnerable plugin to delete comments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in WordPress administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage.
- The attacker does not need to have any user account or be authenticated to the WordPress site.
