Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper input validation of the rating value submitted by users when posting a review. The plugin doesn't ensure that the provided rating is within the expected range (e.g., 0-5) before processing or storing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the failure to sanitize and validate the 'ic\_review\_rating' parameter. This allows an attacker to submit arbitrarily large integer values as ratings.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By submitting very large numbers for the rating, an attacker can trigger excessive memory allocation when the plugin attempts to process and display these reviews, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition on the affected website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. When a user submits a review with an excessively large rating, the review section of the affected page will crash due to memory exhaustion. This makes the website inaccessible or significantly impairs its functionality for legitimate users.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Successful exploitation leads to the server running out of memory, which can also affect other processes on the same server, indirectly causing broader issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/wp-comments-post.php`, where the 'ic\_review\_rating' parameter is manipulated with a large integer value.
- **Comment Submission Form:** The vulnerability is triggered via the comment submission form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user (e.g., a subscriber or any user with the ability to post reviews) on the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the 'ic_review_rating' parameter is vulnerable and how to exploit it (by submitting large integer values).

**Additional Notes:**

- **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.14 of the Reviews Plus plugin by introducing the `ic_sanitize_rating` function that ensures the rating value is within the correct range (0-5).
- **Affected versions:**  Versions prior to 1.2.14 are vulnerable.
- The provided content shows the code changes that were made to fix the vulnerability, which provides more detail than the official CVE description.
- The plugin's configuration also needs to be set to show reviews on all post/pages, for the vulnerability to be triggered.
