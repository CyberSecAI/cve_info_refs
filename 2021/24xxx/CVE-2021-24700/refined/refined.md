- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Forminator plugin fails to sanitize and escape the email field label, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the email field label. This code will then be executed when another user visits the form's settings page, specifically the "Behavior > Redirect URL" tab in the wp-admin panel, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, information disclosure, or other malicious activities on the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors:**  An authenticated user with admin privileges can inject malicious code by modifying the email field label through the plugin's form editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress site. They need to be able to create or edit forms using the Forminator plugin.
