Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization, validation, or escaping of the `id` POST parameter within the `daac_delete_booking_callback` function. This function is hooked to the `daac_delete_booking` AJAX action in the "Diary & Availability Calendar" WordPress plugin. The unsanitized input is directly included in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of unsanitized user-supplied input into an SQL query.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The AJAX action is not properly validated and lacks a capability check, making it accessible to any authenticated user, including subscribers, not just administrators.
- **Missing CSRF Protection:** The AJAX action lacks CSRF protection, which could allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing an SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the WordPress database.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some specific scenarios, it might be possible to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** By using resource-intensive SQL commands, an attacker could cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out using an HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **`action` parameter:** The `action` parameter is set to `daac_delete_booking` to trigger the vulnerable code.
- **`id` parameter:** The malicious SQL payload is inserted into the `id` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, with subscriber or higher privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based SQL injection using the `SLEEP()` function.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0.3 and potentially earlier versions of the plugin.
- The code snippet ` $wpdb->query("DELETE FROM ".$wpdb->prefix.$entries_table." WHERE id = $id");`  highlights the injection point.
- The exploit can be automated using tools like SQLmap.
