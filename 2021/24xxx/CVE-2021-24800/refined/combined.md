## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# DW Question & Answer Pro < 1.3.7 - Arbitrary Comment Edition via IDOR

### Description

The plugin does not check that the comment to edit belongs to the user making the request, allowing any user to edit other comments.

Vendor was notified via Envato on September 28th, 2021, but did not properly fix the issue and was notified numerous times since.

### Proof of Concept

As any authenticated user, post a comment and edit it while capturing the request made, then change the comment\_id parameter to the comment to edit
