Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in multiple AJAX actions within the "BP Better Messages" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not properly validate the nonce in the following actions: `bp_better_messages_leave_chat`, `bp_better_messages_join_chat`, `bp_messages_leave_thread`, `bp_messages_mute_thread`, `bp_messages_unmute_thread`, `bp_better_messages_add_user_to_thread`, and `bp_better_messages_exclude_user_from_thread`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The absence of CSRF checks allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions by sending malicious requests. This could include:
    *   Leaving or joining chat threads.
    *   Muting or unmuting threads.
    *   Adding or excluding users from threads.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a malicious website, email, or any other medium where a user can be tricked into clicking a link or loading a page containing a crafted form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to interact with a malicious link or page.
*   The attacker does not need to have any privileges on the target system.
*   The attacker needs to know the user IDs and thread IDs to craft the malicious request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided code diff shows the fix for this vulnerability, which involves adding nonce verification using `wp_verify_nonce` to the vulnerable AJAX functions.

*   The `wpscan.com` content includes a proof-of-concept HTML form illustrating how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.

*   The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 5.4.

*   The vulnerable plugin is `bp-better-messages` versions prior to 1.9.9.41.
