- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the 'Publish ID' setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  High privilege users (Admin+) can inject malicious scripts into the 'Publish ID' setting, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected page.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker with Admin+ privileges can insert a malicious payload into the 'Publish ID' setting of the Typebot plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Admin+ privileges on the WordPress site.
