## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Typebot < 1.4.3 - Admin+ Stored Cross Site Scripting

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the Publish ID setting, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the 'Publish ID or Full URL" setting and save: "><img src=x onerror=confirm(/XSS/)>
