Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-24207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an insecure default configuration in the WP Page Builder plugin. By default, the plugin allowed users with the "subscriber" role (the lowest privilege user role in WordPress) to access the page builder editor and modify or delete existing content. This was due to the plugin not explicitly restricting access to the page builder functionality. Instead, it relied on the admin to exclude user roles, and if no roles were excluded, all users, including subscribers, would be able to use the builder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is a lack of proper access control, specifically an insecure default configuration that does not restrict access to editing features based on user roles.
*   **Insufficient Privilege Check**: The plugin failed to check if the user has the appropriate privileges to access the page editor via the "wppb_editor" action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Content Modification:** A low-privileged user (subscriber) could modify or delete any existing content on the WordPress website.
*   **Potential for Defacement/Damage:** This could lead to defacement of the site, loss of data, and potentially other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** An attacker could exploit this by directly accessing the post editor's URL for a given post or page, appending `&action=wppb_editor` to the URL.
    *   Example: `wp-admin/post.php?post=610&action=wppb_editor`.
*   **Low Privilege Account:** The attack can be performed by any user with subscriber level access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a user account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.
*   The attacker needs to know the WordPress admin URL (typically `/wp-admin`)
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft the appropriate URL with the `action=wppb_editor` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ramuel Gall.
*   The issue was fixed in version 1.2.4 of the WP Page Builder plugin.
*   The fix involved changing the user role selection box to use include options, sanitizing user-submitted HTML in the "Raw HTML" add-on, and sanitizing user inputs in the form add-ons. The plugin now defaults to only allowing high-privileged users and the rest have to be explicitly granted permissions, mitigating the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and OWASP A5:2017 (Broken Access Control).
*   The CVSS score is 5.4 (Medium).
