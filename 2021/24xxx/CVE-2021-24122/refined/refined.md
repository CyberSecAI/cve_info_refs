Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2021-24122 Apache Tomcat Information Disclosure

CVE-2021-24122 Apache Tomcat Information Disclosure

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9
Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.39
Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.59
Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.106

Description:
When serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file
system it was possible to bypass security constraints and/or view the
source code for JSPs in some configurations. The root cause was the
unexpected behaviour of the JRE API File.getCanonicalPath() which in
turn was caused by the inconsistent behaviour of the Windows API
(FindFirstFileW) in some circumstances.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following
mitigations:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M10 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.40 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.60 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.107 or later

```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the unexpected behavior of the JRE API `File.getCanonicalPath()`, which is due to the inconsistent behavior of the Windows API `FindFirstFileW` when serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Security constraints bypass
  - JSP source code disclosure
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could bypass security constraints and/or view the source code of JSPs
- **Attack vectors**: Serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the Tomcat server which is serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system.

Three security issues have been detected in tomcat8.

CVE-2021-24122

    When serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system,
    Apache Tomcat versions 8.5.0 to 8.5.59 is susceptible to JSP source code
    disclosure in some configurations. The root cause was the unexpected
    behaviour of the JRE API File.getCanonicalPath() which in turn was caused
    by the inconsistent behaviour of the Windows API (FindFirstFileW) in some
    circumstances.
