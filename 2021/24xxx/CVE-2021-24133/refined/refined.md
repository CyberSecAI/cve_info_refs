- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ActiveCampaign plugin versions prior to 8.0.2 lack CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on its settings form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability, allowing unauthorized modification of plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into changing the plugin's API credentials to an attacker-controlled account. This would grant the attacker access to the victim's ActiveCampaign account.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding a malicious HTML form on a website or sending a crafted link/email, an attacker can trigger the vulnerable plugin settings page on a victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator to access a crafted malicious page or trigger a crafted link.
