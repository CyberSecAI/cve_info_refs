- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin allows execution of arbitrary PHP code through the 'widget\_rrm\_similar\_posts\_condition' widget setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the widget settings, specifically within the "Show only if page" setting. This allows a user to inject PHP code which is then executed by the server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves adding the plugin's widget, inserting a malicious PHP payload into the "Show only if page" setting, saving the widget settings, and then accessing a file (e.g. info.php) created by the payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges (Admin+), specifically the ability to add/modify widgets via the WordPress admin interface.
