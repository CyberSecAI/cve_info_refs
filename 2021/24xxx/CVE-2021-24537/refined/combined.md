## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Similar Posts < 3.1.6 - Admin+ Arbitrary PHP Code Execution

### Description

The plugin allow high privilege users to execute arbitrary PHP code in an hardened environment (ie with DISALLOW\_FILE\_EDIT, DISALLOW\_FILE\_MODS and DISALLOW\_UNFILTERED\_HTML set to true) via the 'widget\_rrm\_similar\_posts\_condition' widget setting of the plugin.

Vendor was notified in July 2021, the issue was then escalated to the WP plugins team in August and October due to their unresponsiveness.

### Proof of Concept

- Add the Widget of the plugin (e.g via /wp-admin/widgets.php)
- Put the following payload (replacing WEBROOT by the real value) in the "Show only if page" setting of the widget: file\_put\_contents('/WEBROOT/info.php', '<?php phpinfo(); ?>').
- Save the settings and click on the Update button in the Widgets page
- Then go to /info.php (or whatever path was set above) to access the created info.php
