Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The AutomatorWP plugin lacks proper authorization and capability checks for certain AJAX actions. This allows users with minimal privileges (like "Subscriber") to access and manipulate sensitive data and plugin functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform specific AJAX actions.
* **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the missing authorization, low-privileged users can perform actions they shouldn't be allowed to, including potentially creating new administrator users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can enumerate automations, disclose titles of private posts, and reveal user emails.
* **Arbitrary Function Execution:** Attackers can call arbitrary functions by manipulating the `post_type_cb` parameter.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can overwrite existing automations, including anonymous ones, to create new administrator accounts, which can lead to full site compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **AJAX Actions:** The vulnerability is triggered through specific AJAX actions provided by the plugin, namely:
    * `automatorwp_get_posts`
    * `automatorwp_get_objects`
    * `automatorwp_get_users`
    * `automatorwp_update_item_option`
    * `automatorwp_add_automation_item`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs a WordPress user account with a low-level role such as "Subscriber".
* **Access to WordPress Admin Panel (Indirectly):** The attacker needs the ability to perform AJAX requests, which can be done via the WordPress Dashboard.
* **Knowledge of vulnerable AJAX endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable AJAX action names to exploit.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability using Javascript `jQuery.post` calls.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by making requests directly, without the need for any user interaction beyond the user already having a subscriber account.

This detailed information is consistent with the description of CVE-2021-24717 which involves missing authorization leading to information disclosure and privilege escalation within the AutomatorWP plugin.
