- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape lead values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated user can inject malicious JavaScript code into lead form fields. When a logged-in administrator views the inserted leads, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A POST request is sent to the WordPress admin-ajax.php endpoint with malicious script in the "name_1" field. The injected script is stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the leads through the admin interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to send the malicious payload. The attacker needs to know the vulnerable plugin and its form parameters. The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
