The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the FluentSMTP WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied parameters before storing them in the database and also doesn't escape the values when outputting them in the SMTP settings page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper input sanitization
- Improper output escaping

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users who access the affected settings page. This could lead to:
- Account hijacking
- Data theft
- Unauthorized actions
- Defacement

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `connection[sender_name]` parameter.
- This payload is sent via a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`
- The malicious payload is stored in the database.
- When an administrator views the SMTP settings page, the malicious JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account with the capability to manage plugins in WordPress (e.g., an administrator).
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the WordPress admin interface.
