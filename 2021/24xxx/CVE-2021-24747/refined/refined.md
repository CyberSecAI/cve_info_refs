Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24747:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content, particularly from wpscan.com, explicitly mentions CVE-2021-24747 and describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the SEO Booster plugin, which is related to the plugin changesets also found in the WordPress.org content. This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization and escaping of the `$_REQUEST['order'][0]['dir']` parameter within the "fn\_my\_ajaxified\_dataloader\_ajax" AJAX request handler in the SEO Booster plugin. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is SQL injection. User-supplied input is directly used within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin fails to validate and sanitize the `order[0][dir]` parameter, which can be manipulated by an attacker.
    *   **Use of Prepared Statements:** The plugin uses `prepare` calls but without passing the parameter, hence still vulnerable.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** An attacker can perform blind SQL injection to extract data from the database without directly seeing the output of their queries.
    *   **Error-Based SQL Injection:** An attacker can trigger error-based SQL injection to expose database structure and possibly sensitive data by forcing the database to throw errors containing the result of their injected commands.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **AJAX Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered via an AJAX request to `fn_my_ajaxified_dataloader_ajax`.
    *   **`order[0][dir]` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `order[0][dir]` within the AJAX request. This parameter is used to control the ordering of results in a database query, and by modifying it, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the 'update\_plugins' capability in WordPress to trigger the vulnerable AJAX request.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress installation to intercept and modify the AJAX request.

*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The wpscan.com entry provides SQL injection payloads for boolean-based blind, time-based blind and error-based injections, demonstrating the severity and multiple angles of exploitation of the vulnerability.
    *   The WordPress.org content, particularly the changeset for version 3.8, states "* Security update and 3rd party library updates*", indicating that this version addresses this specific SQL injection vulnerability and other vulnerabilities.
    *   The `seo-booster-keywords.php`, `seo-booster-log.php`, and `seo-booster-seobooster2.php` diffs show code changes in parameter sanitization and query construction.

**3. Additional Observations:**
The provided content gives more information than the official CVE description in a few aspects:
 * Specific vulnerable parameter (order[0][dir]).
 * Specific vulnerable AJAX request endpoint (fn\_my\_ajaxified\_dataloader\_ajax).
 * SQL Injection payloads for exploitation.

**4. Summary Response**
