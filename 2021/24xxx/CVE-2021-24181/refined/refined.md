Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24181:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and the absence of prepared statements when handling user-supplied input within the `tutor_mark_answer_as_correct` function of the Tutor LMS plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (Time-Based):** The `answer_id` parameter in the `tutor_mark_answer_as_correct` AJAX action is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. Because the vulnerable query occurs before updates to the database, a time-based SQL injection is necessary to extract data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials and other potentially confidential information.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Insecurely configured MySQL servers could be exploited to read files, create new files containing webshells, and modify database information

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Action:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `wp_ajax_tutor_mark_answer_as_correct` AJAX action.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** Attackers send a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** Although intended for teachers and administrators, the lack of a capability check means any authenticated user, including students, can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet within the `tutor_mark_answer_as_correct` function:

```php
$answer = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->prefix}tutor_quiz_question_answers WHERE answer_id = {$answer_id} LIMIT 0,1 ;");
```
*   The `answer_id` is taken directly from user input (`$_POST['answer_id']`) and inserted into the SQL query without sanitization or using prepared statements which allows the injection to occur.
* The exploitation of this SQL injection requires the use of time-based SQLi techniques because the query occurs prior to database updates.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content includes proof of concept using sqlmap to demonstrate exploitation.
* This vulnerability is fixed in version 1.7.7 of the Tutor LMS plugin.
* The Wordfence blog post mentions that a firewall rule was created to protect against this vulnerability.
