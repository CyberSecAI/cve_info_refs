- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly escape settings before outputting them in HTML attributes. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages. This can lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with admin privileges can inject the malicious script through plugin settings. Specifically, the "Error message for wrong login credentials," "Lesson Permalink Base", "Youtube API Key", "Name" and "Email Address" settings fields are vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress site where the Tutor LMS plugin is installed.
