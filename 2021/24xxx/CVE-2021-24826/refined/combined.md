## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Custom Content Shortcode < 4.0.2 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape custom fields before outputting them, which could allow Contributor+ (v < 4.0.1) or Admin+ (v < 4.0.2) users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html is disallowed. Please note that such attack is still possible by admin+ in single site blogs by default (but won't be when the unfiltered\_html is disallowed)

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, add a custom field in a post (while in a post editor, open the Options panel > Preferences > Panels and enable the Custom Fields), such as test\_xss with a value of <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
Then add the following shortcode to the post [field test\_xss] and view/preview it to trigger the XSS

### Affects Plugins
