The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24826.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly sanitize custom fields before displaying them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of output escaping of custom fields.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the post containing the shortcode. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- By adding a custom field with malicious javascript, such as `<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>` to a post and including the corresponding shortcode `[field test_xss]`, the XSS payload will be executed on page load.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have at least Contributor role in versions < 4.0.1 or Admin role in versions < 4.0.2 of the WordPress plugin.
- The attacker needs the ability to create or edit posts in the vulnerable WordPress installation.
