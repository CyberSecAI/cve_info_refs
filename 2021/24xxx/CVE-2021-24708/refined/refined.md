- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape the Export's Name before outputting it in the Manage Exports settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users who access the "Manage Exports" page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or data theft.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (Admin+) who can create or edit exports. By inserting a malicious payload in the "Friendly Name" field during export creation/editing, the XSS payload will be stored and triggered when other users visit the "Manage Exports" page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Admin+ user role on the WordPress site is required. The attacker needs to be able to create or modify export settings.
