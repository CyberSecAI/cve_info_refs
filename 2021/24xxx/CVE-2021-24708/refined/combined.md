## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP All Export < 1.3.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape its Export's Name before outputting it in Manage Exports settings, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new export via "New Export" page.
2. Go to "Manage Exports" page, edit the name of an item by click to "Export Settings" under the item. Put XSS payload into the "Friendly Name" form. e.g: name"><img/src/onerror=alert('laladee')>
3. Save and reload Manage Exports page, the XSS will be triggered

### Affects Plugins
