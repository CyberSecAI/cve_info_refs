Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ays_finish_poll` AJAX action, allowing unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `answer` parameter in the `ays_finish_poll` AJAX action. This allows attackers to manipulate database queries.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, which is a major security flaw.
    *   **Time-Based SQL Injection:** Although the direct results of the SQL query are not revealed, an attacker can use time delays (e.g., with `SLEEP()`) in the injected SQL to exfiltrate data, such as user password hashes, through a timing attack.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (password hashes).
    *   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successfully exploiting SQL injection may allow for further attacks on the website including complete compromise of the site.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through the `ays_finish_poll` AJAX action which accepts the `answer` parameter.
    *   The attacker uses a crafted POST request via `jQuery.post` to inject malicious SQL code through the `answer` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server.
    *   The attacker needs to obtain a valid nonce, which can be found on a page with a published poll (value of the `ays_finish_poll` hidden input).
    *   The attacker needs to use timing attack techniques to deduce the response from the database as a direct output of the query is not exposed.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker uses the `UNION SELECT` statement to append their malicious query to the original query of the `ays_finish_poll` action.
*   The attacker uses the `SLEEP()` function to introduce time delays.
*   The attacker uses `LIKE` statements with `CHAR()` function, which allows the attacker to create specific patterns and bypass magic quotes.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to use a time-based attack to determine if a user exists or if a user password hash starts with a specific string.
*   The vulnerable code exists within the `poll-maker` plugin version less than `3.4.2`.
