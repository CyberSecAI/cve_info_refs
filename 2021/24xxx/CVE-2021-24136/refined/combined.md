## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Testimonials Widget < 4.0.0 - Multiple Authenticated Stored XSS

### Description

Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in Testimonials Widget 3.5.1 and lower allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary Javascript code or HTML via the below parameters:

- Author

- Job Title

- Location

- Company

- Email

- URL

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an authenticated medium-privileged user (contributor+) to inject arbitrary Javascript code or HTML. The script is executed for all users visiting the website. Note: testimonials added via by a contributor, go through a manual review process.

May 9th, 2020 - Confirmed & Escalated to WP Plugins Team

May 11th, 2020 - WP Plugins Team Investigating

July 3rd, 2020 - No updates, releasing.

July 12th, 2020 - v4.0.0 released, fixing the issues.

### Proof of Concept

1. Download and install "Testimonials Widget 3.5.1" from https://wordpress.org/plugins/testimonials-widget/
2. Go into "Testimonials" tab from the sidebar and create a new testimonials by clicking on the "Add New" button
3. Enter testimonial's name, content. In "Author", "Job Title", "Location", "Company", "URL" fields of "Testimonial Data", input an XSS vector, For example:
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
4. Save the changes and click on "Submit for Review" (if roles is Contributor) or "Publish" (if roles is Author or Editor).
5. By visiting permalink, ex: http://example.com/?testimonials-widget=<name-of-testimonial> or by visiting posts that have embedded shortcodes (Ex: [testimonials limit=5 paging=true char\_limit=0]), the JavaScript code injected would be executed.
The problem lied in files at "templates/" folder, where plugin echos user input values without sanitizing:
Ex: testimonials-widget/templates/span-author.php
<?php
global $tw\_template\_args;
$testimonial = $tw\_template\_args['testimonial'];
$author = empty( $testimonial['testimonial\_author'] ) ? $testimonial['testimonial\_source'] : $testimonial['testimonial\_author'];
?>
<span class="author"><?php echo $author; ?></span>
