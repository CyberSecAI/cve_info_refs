- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Testimonials Widget plugin echoes user input values without sanitizing them in the `templates/` folder. Specifically, the plugin does not sanitize the 'Author', 'Job Title', 'Location', 'Company', 'Email', and 'URL' fields when rendering testimonials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user with contributor privileges or higher to inject arbitrary JavaScript code or HTML. This code is then executed for all users who visit the website or view content containing the embedded shortcodes. This can lead to account compromise, malware delivery, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating or modifying a testimonial and inserting malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable input fields (Author, Job Title, Location, Company, Email, URL) via the WordPress admin interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an authenticated user with at least contributor privileges within the WordPress installation.
