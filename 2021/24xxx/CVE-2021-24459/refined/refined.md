{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `get_results()` and `get_items()` functions in the plugin did not properly validate or sanitize the `orderby` parameter before using it in SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authenticated Blind SQL Injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database or manipulate the database content.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious `orderby` parameter in a GET or POST request to sort items within the plugin's admin menu.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the affected functionality in the plugin's admin dashboard."
