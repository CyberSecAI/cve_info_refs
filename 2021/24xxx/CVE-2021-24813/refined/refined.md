Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of Custom Field Names within the "Events Made Easy" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `field_name` parameter was not being properly processed before being stored and displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize the `field_name` input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the database. This injected code will be executed when a user accesses the admin pages where these custom fields are displayed (e.g., Custom Field, Pending Bookings, Approved Bookings).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session who accesses the vulnerable admin pages. This can lead to various malicious actions such as:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens, leading to account compromise.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying content on the vulnerable website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves manipulating the `field_name` input field when creating or editing custom fields via the plugin's admin interface (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=eme-formfields`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin or High-Privilege User:** The attacker needs to have administrative or high privilege access to the WordPress admin panel to add or edit custom fields. The content notes "Admin+ stored XSS" and "high privilege users".
*   The attacker does not require any additional privileges beyond the ability to add or edit custom fields.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is in `eme_formfields.php`, where the `field_name` parameter from the POST request is not properly sanitized before being saved.
*   The fix was implemented by using the `eme_kses` function to sanitize the `field_name` input.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.24 of the plugin.
