## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SEO Redirection < 7.1 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise the Redirect From and Redirect To fields when creating a new redirect in the dashboard, allowing high privilege users (even with the unfiltered\_html disabled) to set XSS payloads in them

### Proof of Concept

Create a new Custom redirect (/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=seo-redirection.php) and set a payload such as /"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script> in the Redirect From and Redirect To fields

### Affects Plugins
