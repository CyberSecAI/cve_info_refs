- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize the "Redirect From" and "Redirect To" fields when creating a new redirect.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page in the WordPress dashboard where users can create new redirects.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high privilege user (e.g., administrator) with the ability to create new redirects in the plugin's settings. It's noted that this vulnerability is exploitable even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disabled.
