- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize the color setting of the calculator background.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the calculator settings, which will be executed when a user visits a page containing the calculator, leading to potential unauthorized actions, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By accessing the plugin settings page, specifically the color selection for the calculator background.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges to access the plugin settings page. They also need the ability to create new pages and insert the calculator shortcode.
