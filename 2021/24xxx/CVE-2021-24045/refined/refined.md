Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue within the handling of the `typeof` unary operator in Facebook Hermes. Specifically, when `typeof` is applied to an invalid type (such as a literal empty value in unreachable code).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Type Confusion:** The core issue is that the Hermes JavaScript engine doesn't properly handle the `typeof` operator when applied to invalid types, leading to a type confusion vulnerability. This implies that the engine might be incorrectly identifying or processing the type of the operand, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   The vulnerability could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. While the provided information doesn't elaborate on the exact nature of the impact, type confusion vulnerabilities can sometimes be exploited to achieve more severe consequences, like arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by the evaluation of untrusted JavaScript that contains `typeof` operator applied to an invalid type.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Untrusted JavaScript execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute untrusted JavaScript code within the context of an application using a vulnerable version of Hermes. The Facebook advisory indicates that applications using Hermes, which permit the evaluation of untrusted Javascript are vulnerable, while most React Native applications are not affected.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided commit addresses this vulnerability by ensuring the simplification of `typeof` is not applied when the operator is applied to an invalid type.
- The provided commit includes a test case to prevent the regression of this vulnerability.
