Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24534:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization or escaping of the "php_id" setting within the PhoneTrack Meu Site Manager plugin before it's outputted back into the page's HTML attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not properly handle user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities including but not limited to:
    -  Session hijacking
    -  Defacement of the website
    -  Redirection to malicious websites
    -  Data theft
    -  Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "php_id" setting of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the WordPress admin panel, specifically the plugin's settings page (`/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=phtmanager`).  The CVSS score indicates the attacker needs to have 'high' privileges (`PR:H`), usually admin.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the plugin's settings to insert the malicious payload.
