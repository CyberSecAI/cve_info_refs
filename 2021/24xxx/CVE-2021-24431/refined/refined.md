- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF protection when saving settings and fails to sanitize or escape user-provided input when generating the flag bar on the frontend.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into changing plugin settings, injecting malicious JavaScript code. This code is then executed in the frontend for all users who visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious form, an attacker can induce a logged-in administrator to submit the form, changing the plugin's settings to include malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
