- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin failed to properly escape fields (email ID, subject, recipient) displayed in the Activity page of the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser when they view the Activity tab of the plugin's dashboard. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject an XSS payload into the email subject field, typically by using a contact form on the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails through the vulnerable website (e.g., through a contact form) and manipulate the subject line to include an XSS payload. The attacker also needs the victim to be an administrator who is logged in and views the plugin's Activity tab.
