Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `orderby` parameter within the WordPress plugin "Affiliate Manager". This parameter is used directly in SQL queries without validation, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct use of the unsanitized `orderby` parameter in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to introduce a time-based blind SQL injection using the `SLEEP()` function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to the WordPress admin panel (`/wp-admin/admin.php`).
- **`orderby` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `orderby` parameter.
- **Specific Plugin Page:** The vulnerable page is located at `page=wpam-affiliates&tab=export_data` within the plugin's admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or have admin-level privileges within the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. The Cookie header in the proof of concept contains `[admin+]`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 2.8.7 of the "Affiliate Manager" plugin.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves sanitizing the `orderby` parameter by restricting its values to "dateCreated", "affiliateId", "trackingTokenId", or "transactionId" depending on the context. The `order` parameter is restricted to "ASC" or "DESC".
- The provided links to the code changes show how the fix was implemented by sanitizing the `orderby` parameter with a specific list of allowed values, preventing arbitrary SQL injection.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.8 (Medium), indicating a potentially serious issue.
- The attacker can cause a time delay via SQL injection (using the `SLEEP()` function), which can be useful in blind SQL injection attacks.
