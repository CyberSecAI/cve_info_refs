The plugin does not sanitize the id parameter of its awesome\_weather\_refresh AJAX action, leading to an unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability.

Note (WPScanTeam): The issue was reported to the WP plugins team on May 4th, 2021, then June 7th, 2021 due to lack of update.

<input type="hidden" name="id" value='aa"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>' />
