{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin does not sanitize the `id` parameter of its `awesome_weather_refresh` AJAX action.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `awesome_weather_refresh` and a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to induce a user to click on a malicious link that triggers the vulnerable AJAX call."

    "affected_components": [

  "additional_information": {
     "proof_of_concept": "The provided HTML form and POST request example demonstrate how to trigger the XSS vulnerability. The payload `aa\"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>` is injected via the `id` parameter.",
