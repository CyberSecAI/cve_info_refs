Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24629

**Root Cause:**
- The `Post Content XMLRPC` WordPress plugin fails to sanitize or escape the `id` GET parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The unsanitized `id` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database.
- The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the ability to cause a time delay on the server using the injected `SLEEP(5)` command, which can be used as an indication of successful injection and can be further exploited for more damaging purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request.
- Specifically, the `id` parameter within the URL `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pcx_add_sites&mode=add&id=...` is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User (Admin+):**  The attacker needs to be logged into the WordPress admin dashboard to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `list_sites.php` at line 103:
```php
$id=$_GET['id'];
$table=$wpdb->prefix."pcx";
$results_edit=$wpdb->get_row("SELECT * FROM ".$table." WHERE id = ".$id)
```
- The code directly uses the `$_GET['id']` value within the SQL query without any sanitization.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided exploit demonstrates an injection using a `SLEEP()` command.
- The provided SQLMap command shows how to automate the SQL injection testing.
- The plugin has been closed, indicating that no fix will be released.
