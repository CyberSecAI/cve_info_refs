- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin failed to sanitize user-provided input in its settings, allowing high-privilege users to inject XSS payloads. Specifically, the "Standard fields on reviews" and "Custom fields on reviews" settings within the plugin's "Review Form Settings" were vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view pages where reviews are enabled. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code through the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrative privileges within the WordPress site to access and modify the plugin's settings.
