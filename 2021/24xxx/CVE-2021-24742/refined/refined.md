Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24742:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of a nonce for authorization instead of a capability check when handling the `rtWLSSettings` AJAX action. This allows users with the Editor role (who have the ability to generate nonce values) to modify the plugin settings even though they lack the necessary capabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Authorization:** The plugin relies on a nonce for authorization rather than verifying if the user has the correct permissions to update plugin settings. This is an insecure practice.
*   **Broken Access Control:** Users with the "Editor" role, who should not have the ability to modify plugin settings, are able to do so.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with the "Editor" role could arbitrarily change the plugin's settings. This could lead to unintended behavior on the website, and, depending on the nature of the plugin settings, could have other impacts on the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `rtWLSSettings` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least the "Editor" role.
*   The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the WordPress site (e.g. through a script or by using the browser developer tools).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information includes a Proof of Concept that shows how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a POST request to the `ajaxurl` endpoint with specific parameters, including a nonce value that an editor user can obtain.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Broken Access Control" under OWASP Top 10 and aligns with CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).
*   The CVSS score is 2.7 (Low)
*   The issue was fixed in version 1.3.37 of the plugin.
