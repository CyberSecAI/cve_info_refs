Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an **Improper Access Control** issue within the wpDataTables WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not adequately restrict access to table data based on user permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The plugin fails to properly validate and enforce user permissions when accessing and manipulating table data.
- **Parameter Manipulation:** A low-privileged authenticated user can manipulate the `formdata[wdt_ID]` parameter in HTTP requests to gain access to another user's data within the same table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can access and manage data belonging to other users within the same table.
- **Data Modification/Takeover:** By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can overwrite or modify user data, leading to potential data corruption, loss or manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves tampering with the `formdata[wdt_ID]` parameter in HTTP requests.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges.
- **Table Access:** The attacker needs to access a page where a vulnerable table is published.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated WordPress User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site.
- **Basic Web Request Manipulation Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests using tools like Burp Suite or similar proxies.
- **Access to a vulnerable table:** The attacker needs to know of the table shortcode and its publication location on the website.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in wpDataTables versions prior to 3.4.2.
- The exploit involves changing the value of `formdata[wdt_ID]` to the user ID of another user whose data they want to access.
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint and the `wdt_save_table_frontend` action.
- The plugin relies on the User ID column in the database table to manage permissions, however, it doesn't prevent the user from modifying their User ID via `formdata[wdt_ID]`.
