## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# wpDataTables < 3.4.2 - Improper Access Control leading to Table Permission Takeover

### Description

The plugin has Improper Access Control. A low privilege authenticated user that visits the page where the table is published can tamper the parameters to access the data of another user that are present in the same table by taking over the user permissions on the table through formdata[wdt\_ID] parameter. By exploiting this issue an attacker is able to access and manage the data of all users in the same table.

Note: This affect the premium version of the plugin, however, both the premium and free plugins have the same slug.

## TL;DR

Me and my colleague Massimiliano Ferraresi have found four security issues:

**1 - Improper Access Control**: An authenticated user that visits the page where the table is published can tamper the parameters to access the data of another user that are present in the same table by taking over the user permissions on the table through **formdata[wdt\_ID]** parameter.

**2 - Improper Access Control**: An authenticated user that visits the page where the table is published can tamper the parameters to delete the data of another user that are present in the same table through **id\_key** and **id\_val** parameters.

**3 - SQL Injection**: An authenticated user on the WordPress interface that visits the page where the tables are listed can perform a SQL injection attack in the table search parameter **start**.

**4 - SQL Injection**: An authenticated user on the WordPress interface that visits the page where the tables are listed can perform a SQL injection attack in the table search parameter **length**.

## Plugin Information

* **Organization Name:** TMS
* **Web Page:** <https://tms-outsource.com>
* **Vulnerability Disclosure Info or Technical Support Web Page:** <https://tmsplugins.ticksy.com/submit/#100004195>
* **Plugin name:** wpDataTables
* **Plugin version:** <= 3.4.1
* **Plugin Web Page:** <https://wpdatatables.com>

wpDataTables is a best-selling WordPress table plugin which makes very easy to work with tables, charts and data management. It is currently used by 40,000+ companies and individuals in financial, scientific, statistical, commercial and other sectors.

During another security auditing of the product, we have found four security issues. The first two are broken access controls on accessing and deleting data on the same table. Also, the other two are Blind SQL Injections on 2 different parameters.

The fix was developed with the release 3.4.2, 16 days after our vulnerability disclosure. This time they didn’t mention us, maybe we have created some troubles for them.

**For all folks of wpDataTables Team**: No problem for us, the important thing is to collaborate and make the products more secure as possible. See you soon 😘

## Vulnerability Details

### **1 - Software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor - CWE-284**

* **Summary:** An authenticated user can tamper HTTP parameters to access to the data on the table of another user by taking over the user permissions on the table.
* **Prerequisites:** A simple table with the settings of *Enable of front-end editing* and *Limiting editing to own data only* needs to be created and published in a page on WordPress.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2021-24197](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24197) | [**8.1** (High)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24197)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

First, it is necessary to create a simple table with three columns and two or more rows. Then, the table can be published on a page with the following settings:

* Allow front-end editing
* Limit editing to own data only

An authenticated user that visits the page where the table is published can tamper the parameters to access the data of another user that are present in the same table through **formdata[wdt\_ID]** parameter.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <http://hostname/portal/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php>
* **HTTP Parameter:** formdata[wdt\_ID]

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

The starting point is a standard installation of WordPress version 5.6 (the latest), with a fresh install of the wpDataTables plugin, without further configuration. After the plugin installation, it is necessary to create a simple table used for the vulnerability PoC.

To create the table, login to WordPress as **admin**.

Under **wpDataTables** -> **Create a Table**, select **Create a data table manually** and then **Next**.

![Creation of the table](/images/18057ef8f7a7d086bfbe9ee37ac9e46a.png)

The table can have simple data, like the following:
\* **Table name:** products
\* **Number of columns:** 3
\* **Column 1:**
\* **Name:** name
\* **Type:** One line string
\* **Column 2:**
\* **Name:** price
\* **Type:** Float
\* **Column 3** (**The User ID column is responsible to manage the user’s authorizations**);
\* **Name:** User ID
\* **Type:** Integer

Add the table data via the web interface:

Confirm the table with **Create the table** -> **Open in Standard view**

Insert three rows with some data, in the userid column is necessary to insert the ID of WordPress users.
For PoC we registered two users **max (id=1)** and **test (id=2)**

![Insert value](/images/7df23ef50e2a15feee5a28014d30e48b.png)
Under **Editing** click on **Allow front-end editing** and on **Limiting editing to own data only**.
After this operation under the **User ID column** select **userid** like the image below:

![Set the permission](/images/3ca0fb56ffef3ad944d867967fee4810.png)

In this way the plugin can show the data depending on the userid value.

To publish the table it is necessary to copy its shortcode on the home page.

![Insert shortcode)](/images/f2932527ad601b36a33ae845c1c28269.png)

Login through WordPress with the user **test** (id=2), then go on the page <http://hostname/home/> and the table will show only the record for this specific user:

![Data test user](/images/84314e1bdd8d297f4beea5dc7086e7a2.png)

Click on **New Entry** and add new record on the table:

![Add new entry](/images/d9720d29c5d93a18d1177a8cb8cac88a.png)

With the HTTP Proxy like Burp Suite intercept the request for adding a new record:

![Burp - Add request](/images/d067598b38be92e2e64343ce04a37d25.png)

This is the intercepted request:

```
POST /portal/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: hostname
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

```

For exploiting this vulnerability is necessary to change the value of **formdata[wdt\_ID]** to **1** and then **delete** the following fields from the HTTP request:

```
formdata%5Bname%5D=arduino&formdata%5Bprice%5D=10%2C00&formdata%5Buserid%5D=

```

The new HTTP request to change the permission on the table will be like the following:

```
POST /portal/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: hostname
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

action=wdt_save_table_frontend&wdtNonce=55f87706c7&formdata%5Btable_id%5D=19&formdata%5Bwdt_ID%5D=1

```

The image below shows the correct request/response received from the server:

![Burp - Modified request](/images/d66af867b83529996f13244d61e4e3e9.png)

In this way with the user **test** (id=2) we are able to overwrite the value of **userid** and then we can view and manage the data of the user **max** (id=1), as depicted by the following screenshot:

![Takeover of data permissions](/images/1156cfd5ab5d2e0e009e34746e2b83ff.png)

The vulnerability is tested on wpDataTables version 3.4.1:

![Vulnerable version confirmation - wpDataTables 3.4.1](/images/db81e4598a66e10e267854e00bb9451a.png)

**Security Impact**

By exploiting this issue an attacker is able to access and manage the data of all users in the same table.

### **2 - Software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor - CWE-284**

* **Summary:** An authenticated user can tamper HTTP parameters to delete the data in the table of another user.
* **Prerequisites:** A simple table with the settings of *Enable of front-end editing* and *Limiting editing to own data only* needs to be created and published in a page on WordPress.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2021-24198](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24198) | [**8.1** (High)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24198)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

First, it is necessary to create a simple table with three columns and two or more rows. Then, the table can be published on a page with the following settings:

* Allow front-end editing
* Limit editing to own data only

An authenticated user that visits the page where the table is published can tamper the parameters to delete the data of another user that are present in the same table through **id\_key** and **id\_val** parameters.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <http://hostname/portal/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php>
* **HTTP Parameters:** id\_key and id\_val

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

The starting point is a standard installation of WordPress version 5.6 (the latest), with a fresh install of the wpDataTables plugin, without further configuration. After the plugin installation, it is necessary to create a simple table used for the vulnerability PoC.

To create the table, use the same steps of the previous vulnerability.

Login through WordPress with the user **test** (id=2), then go on the page <http://hostname/home/> and the table will show only the record for this specific user:

![Data test user](/images/975efdcb8dd74d7e8f3a0814d49778b2.png)

Click on **Delete** and delete the record on the table:

![Delete entry](/images/353bc131e133f8c4df7a757d0bcdc626.png)

With the HTTP Proxy like Burp Suite intercept the request for deleting the record:

![Burp - Add request](/images/d03be370d81cc7d36c3a49111206becb.png)

This is the intercepted request:

```
POST /portal/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: hostname
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://hostname/portal/home/
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 175
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Cookie: [REDACTED]

action=wdt_delete_table_row&id_key=wdt_ID&id_val=2&table_id=21&wdtNonce=2fe2c28b36

```

For exploiting this vulnerability is necessary to change the value of **id\_key** to **userid** and the **id\_val** to **1**:

```
action=wdt_delete_table_row&id_key=userid&id_val=1&table_id=21&wdtNonce=2fe2c28b36

```

The new HTTP request to change the permission on the table will be like the following:

```
POST /portal/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: hostname
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://hostname/portal/home/
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 175
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Cookie: [REDACTED]

action=wdt_delete_table_row&id_key=userid&id_val=1&table_id=21&wdtNonce=2fe2c28b36

```

The image below shows the correct request/response received from the server:

![Burp - Modified request](/images/2641b133c3513e672dd4c2f2bcaf59b1.png)

In this way with the user **test** (id=2) we are able to delete all the values of the user **max** (id=1), as depicted by the following screenshot:

![Takeover of data permissions](/images/71682a7f29ebc9c26d52791ed34c16e6.png)

The vulnerability is tested on wpDataTables version 3.4.1:

![Vulnerable version confirmation - wpDataTables 3.4.1](/images/db81e4598a66e10e267854e00bb9451a.png)

**Important Note**

In the **id\_key** parameter it is possible to insert any column name that are presents in the table (*string* datatype).

The **id\_val** parameter supports only *int* and *float* datatype.

So, with these parameters it is possible to delete all records in the database that respect this condition, because of the query in the code that is similar to the following:

```
DELETE FROM wp_wpdatatable_19 WHERE id_key=id_val -- id_val is datatype int or float;

```

**Security Impact**

By exploiting this issue an attacker is able to delete the data of all users in the same table.

### **3 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’) - CWE-89**

* **Summary:** An authenticated user can perform a SQL injection attack to access all the data in the database and obtain access to the WordPress application.
* **Prerequisites:** WordPress account. Also, a simple table with default settings needs to be created via the web interface.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2021-24199](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24199) | [**6.5** (Medium)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24199)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

First, it is necessary to create a simple table with two columns and two rows. Then, an authenticated user on the WordPress interface that visits the page where the tables are listed can perform a SQL injection attack in the table search parameter **start**.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <http://hostname/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_wdtable&table_id=1>
* **HTTP Parameter:** start

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

The starting point is a standard installation of WordPress version 5.6 (the latest), with a fresh install of the wpDataTables plugin, without further configuration. After the plugin installation, it is necessary to create a simple table used for the vulnerability PoC.

To create the table, login to WordPress as **admin**.

Under **wpDataTables** -> **Create a Table**, select **Create a data table manually** and then **Next**.

![Creation of the table (1)](/images/18057ef8f7a7d086bfbe9ee37ac9e46a.png)

The table can have simple data, like the following:
\* **Table name:** products
\* **Number of columns:** 2
\* **Column 1:**
\* **Name:** name
\* **Type:** One line string
\* **Column 2:**
\* **Name:** price
\* **Type:** Integer

Add the table data via the web interface:

![Creation of the table (2)](/images/26aa9c7f9d8767ad9db0cf57f1eafd6d.png)

Confirm the table with **Create the table** -> **Open in Excel-like editor**

Insert two rows with some data , like the following picture, then confirm with **Save Changes**:

![Creation of the table (3)](/images/0a4a1693d5639add992b75de562cb4b1.png)

Re-login or leave the authenticated session.

On thew WordPress administrative page, under **Dashboard**, select **wpDataTables** menu:

![Selection of the table (1)](/images/7f49b4b013dd1e1caf3c7cb01067d130.png)

Select the table name, **products** in this case.

![Selection of the table (2)](/images/c1284d760c77acce1a1bb6e0ed59db81.png)

Intercept the browser session with a proxy like [**Burp Suite**](https://portswigger.net/burp).

The HTTP POST request will be like the following:

![Burp - Selection of the table](/images/9b599e15ce7b9a362394be5a93a22527.png)

Copy the intercepted request, and paste the content a text file named `draw.txt`, similar to the following one:

```

Then, use the [**SQLMap**](http://sqlmap.org) tool to exploit the vulnerability with the following command:

```
# Clear SQLMap local cache:
rm -rf ~/.local/share/sqlmap
sqlmap -r draw.txt --level=5 --risk=3 --random-agent --dbms=mysql --banner -p start --batch

```

The banner of the database is gathered as PoC of the vulnerability:

![SQLMap - Banner](/images/54ce2183472c83baaf01c211edbaad4c.png)

It is possible to dump all the WordPress database to extract the credentials. If a successful password cracking attack is accomplished, an attacker can use the credentials to login to the WordPress admin page.

To extract the **wp\_users** table, use the following command:

```
sqlmap -r draw.txt --level=5 --risk=3 --random-agent --dbms=mysql -p start -D wordpress -T wp_users --dump

```

![SQLMap - Database dump](/images/bb8700cb2976763ed35c778acc659f0e.png)

The vulnerability is tested on wpDataTables version 3.4.1, as depicted by the following screenshot:

![Vulnerable version confirmation - wpDataTables 3.4.1](/images/db81e4598a66e10e267854e00bb9451a.png)

**Security Impact**

By exploiting this issue an attacker is able to access all the data in the database and obtain access to the WordPress application, because all the data, including WordPress credentials, can be extracted and cracked.

It is important to note that a valid WordPress administrator account is also able to execute Remote Code Execution attack because of the capability of installing or modifying existing plugins or themes via the web interface. This scenario allows the entire compromise of the target operating system where wpDataTables is installed.

### **4 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’) - CWE-89**

* **Summary:** An authenticated user can perform a SQL injection attack to access all the data in the database and obtain access to the WordPress application.
* **Prerequisites:** WordPress account. Also, a simple table with default settings needs to be created via the web interface.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2021-24200](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24200) | [**6.5** (Medium)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24200)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

First, it is necessary to create a simple table with two columns and two rows. Then, an authenticated user on the WordPress interface that visits the page where the tables are listed can perform a SQL injection attack in the table search parameter **length**.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <http://hostname/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_wdtable&table_id=1>
* **HTTP Parameter:** length

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

The starting point is a standard installation of WordPress version 5.6 (the latest), with a fresh install of the wpDataTables plugin, without further configuration. After the plugin installation, it is necessary to create a simple table used for the vulnerability PoC.

To create the table, use the same steps of the previous vulnerability.

Re-login or leave the authenticated session.

On thew WordPress administrative page, under **Dashboard**, select **wpDataTables** menu:

![Selection of the table (1)](/images/7f49b4b013dd1e1caf3c7cb01067d130.png)

Select the table name, **products** in this case.

![Selection of the table (2)](/images/c1284d760c77acce1a1bb6e0ed59db81.png)

Intercept the browser session with a proxy like [**Burp Suite**](https://portswigger.net/burp).

The HTTP POST request will be like the following:

![Burp - Selection of the table](/images/9b599e15ce7b9a362394be5a93a22527.png)

Copy the intercepted request, and paste the content a text file named `draw.txt`, similar to the following one:

```

```

Then, use the [**SQLMap**](http://sqlmap.org) tool to exploit the vulnerability with the following command:

```
# Clear SQLMap local cache:
rm -rf ~/.local/share/sqlmap
sqlmap -r draw.txt --level=5 --risk=3 --random-agent --dbms=mysql --banner -p length --batch

```

The banner of the database is gathered as PoC of the vulnerability:

![SQLMap - Banner](/images/2a2dfaf08a7be9042f4ef157424c8ada.png)

It is possible to dump all the WordPress database to extract the credentials. If a successful password cracking attack is accomplished, an attacker can use the credentials to login to the WordPress admin page.

To extract the **wp\_users** table, use the following command:

```
sqlmap -r draw.txt --level=5 --risk=3 --random-agent --dbms=mysql -p length -D wordpress -T wp_users --dump

```

![SQLMap - Database dump](/images/5bbe2d163183e528ed12f244b5503d40.png)

The vulnerability is tested on wpDataTables version 3.4.1, as depicted by the following screenshot:

[Read more here](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/front-end-editing/excel-like-editor/).
* **Lots of improvements for charts –** more formatting and styling options for both engines, group feature. Read more in the [blogpost](https://wpdatatables.com/wpdatatables-1-7-excel-tables-wordpress/),  check the [video part](https://youtu.be/UoLLEom2A-g?t=1m31s) showing the new features.

## Version 1.6.2 (released 12.05.2016)

See more information in [the full blogpost](https://wpdatatables.com/wpdatatables-1-7-excel-tables-wordpress/).

**A regular update, adding some functionalities, stability improvements, and several features:**

* **HTML editor for editable tables** – now for columns which have string column type you can edit the data using a HTML WISYWYG editor (TinyMCE), both for editor dialog and for in-line editing.
* **Addons support** – from now on plugin supports addons, each addon brings some unique feature which extends the core functionality. The first addon launched is the [Report Builder](https://wpreportbuilder.com/), which is a tool for generating individualised Word DOCX and Excel XLSX documents in real-time from WordPress.
* **Responsive Charts** – this was a highly requested feature: now each chart (both Google and Highchart) can be responsive – just tick the “responsive” checkbox near the width input. Responsive chart will occupy 100% width of the container, instead of having fixed width, therefore always render correctly on any device types, and when you resize browser window.
* **Fixes for sum row** – Sum row works more stable now.
* **Fixes for chart editing** – selected Google chart type and the follow table filtering option didn’t persist correctly on editing, now this works fine.
* **Fixes for conditional formatting for values above 1.000.000** – now conditional formatting works correctly for any numbers.
* **Security fixes** – more security checks added to the plugin back-end to prevent attacks.
* **More HTML allowed in the editable tables**. We restricted allowed HTML for editable tables in 1.6.1 for better protection against XSS. Now the list of allowed tags was extended.
* **Fix for uploading images in editable tables**. Editing images wasn’t always working smooth, fixed now.
* **Fix for ‘skip thousands separator’ in server-side tables**. The setting was ignored for tables with server-side processing, now it works correctly.
* **WordPress 4.5.2 compatibility confirmed**. This site is running WP 4.5.2 so you can see it works.
* **PHP7 compatibility confirmed**. After multiple internal tests no conflicts or problems found.
* **Other minor stability improvements and bugfixes**

## Version 1.6.1 (released 23.03.2016)

**A large update, a lot of new functions. Was supposed to be a stability update, but grown to a large release. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLPz-b2B0ig) to see a brief video overview of the new features.      Among others:**

* **Inline editing** – you can edit the content in editable tables directly from the cells now. [Click here](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/front-end-editing/inline-editing/) to see the docs, or [here for video demo](https://youtu.be/bLPz-b2B0ig?t=1m).
* **Conditional formatting** – it is possible to highlight rows, cells, columns, or change CSS classes. [Click here to see the docs](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/conditional-formatting/),  or [here for video demo](https://youtu.be/bLPz-b2B0ig?t=7m5s).
* **Formula (calculated) columns** – you can add columns in the table that will be calculated based on other columns values. [Click here to see the docs](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/formula-calculated-columns/), or [here to see video demo](https://youtu.be/bLPz-b2B0ig?t=16m39s).
* **Sum (totals) row** – you can show totals for numeric columns in the table footer now. [Click here to see the docs](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/sum-totals-row/), or [here to see video demo](https://youtu.be/bLPz-b2B0ig?t=23m50s).
* **Auto-read possible values for column** – if the table has server-side processing enabled you don’t need to type in possible values manually any more. [See video demo](https://youtu.be/bLPz-b2B0ig?t=26m).
* **Realtime auto-refresh for tables and charts** – Tables which have server-side processing enabled can auto-reload in front-end with defined interval. [See video demo](https://youtu.be/bLPz-b2B0ig?t=30m23s).
* **No-flash Table Tools, and advanced configuration for Table Tools** – the export functionality is now Flash-independent, works on HTML5, also you can define from the admin panel which buttons to show or hide per each table. [See video demo](https://youtu.be/bLPz-b2B0ig?t=34m20s).
* **Global search via URL**. You can add a special key in the page URL, and your table will get pre-filtered on load. [Click here to see the docs](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/global-search-via-url/), or [See video demo](https://youtu.be/bLPz-b2B0ig?t=38m49s).
* **Auto-generate thumbs for image columns in editable tables**. When you upload a new image, a thumb with a link to full picture will be inserted automatically.
* **Skip thousands separator for integer columns**. If your column is an integer, but you don’t want formatting (e.g. for years or product codes), you can disable it.
* **Fixed filter rendered in header.** It was looking clumsy before when you chose to render the filter in header, now it is rendered in a separate row.
* **Non-UTF8 names for columns in Table Constructor**. This was causing trouble before, but now it’s allowed.
* **DataTables front-end renderer library upgraded to 1.10.10**
* **PHPExcel updated to latest version**
* **Lots of stability and UX improvements and bugfixes**

## Version 1.6 (released 23.07.2015)

**A major update with a lot of new features. Can’t be covered with this whatsnew – please check the documentation. Basically the biggest change to wpDataTables since      launch.**

* **Table constructor module** – see the docs [here](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-new-wpdatatables-with-table-constructor/building-and-filling-in-the-tables-manually/).
* **Charts rewritten** – now rendered not only by Google Charts, but also Highcharts.
* **Chart constructor wizard**.
* **Google docs support**
* **Validation for front-end editing**
* **Editable tables where users can edit only their own data**
* **Enhanced Placeholders logic for queries**
* **Server-side processing tables allow complicated queries**
* **And many more…**

## Version 1.5.6 (released 13.02.2015)

**Just another patch on a long way to Table Constructor module. No new features, just bugfixes.**

* **False update notification fixed** – in the previous version there was a tiny bug that caused plugin to report that there’s a new version available all the time, also to throw a notice in the update list; this is fixed now.
* **Attachments title not displayed** – refactoring in the previous version caused an attachments title (uploaded from front-end editor) not to be displayed; this is fixed now.
* **XML parsing errors** – a bug which caused a problem with XML format parsing is fixed; also added a check if XML elements have attributes for correct parsing.
* **Table ID notice in shortcode fixed** – in some cases when ID was empty it thrown a notice; it is fixed now.
* **Front-end editor add/edit row selectbox problem** – front-end editor dialog selectbox was showing first value as selected by default, but actually nothing was selected. Fixed now.
* **Formatted numbers in range filters did not work.** Values more then 1000, or if user entered the value in the same format as in cell caused the filter to crash. Fixed now.
* **Column filter selectbox when shown in header did not show.** Minor issue with CSS fixed, dropdowns will show correctly now.
* **Date parsing fixed for CSV.** In some cases dates weren’t parsed correctly, works fine now.
* **New filter added for the table title** (wpdatatables\_filter\_table\_title) – you can use it to change the title dynamically, or hide it when you don’t need it
* **Custom JS was multiply escaped** (‘\\\\’). Now it’s fixed.
* **EU date format sorting issue** – when there was an empty cell in a date column with EU-formatted date (dd.mm.yyyy) it crushed sorting; now it’s fixed – empty cells will always be treated as the earliest date possible.
* **Preview with charts fixed.** Now you can preview your charts in the backend along with the table, which didn’t work in earlier versions.
* **Even rows color picker didn’t work.** Now it’s fixed and you can choose the color of the even rows.
* **Font color picker for table header didn’t work.** fixed now.

## Version 1.5.5 (released 23.11.2014)

**Refactoring. A couple of minor bugfixes also included.**

* **Auto updates** – we planned this for 1.6, but since there were already a couple of unplanned releases, we decided not to postpone it any more to make life easier for users. Starting from current version, if you enter your Envato Purchase Code, plugin will tell you when the new version is released, and do the auto update. To prevent piracy, maximum number of downloads of one version per purchase code is 2. But you can always download new versions directly from Envato and install in the good old-fashioned manual way.
* **File-based tables speedup** – for large tables based on files you should have a significant improvement in speed now.

## Version 1.5.4 (released 23.11.2014)

**Security patch. A couple of minor bugfixes also included.**

* **Uploader security issue fixed**.
* **Number range filter issue fixed**. There was an issue in version 1.5.3 that broke number range filtering because of number formatting, for non server-side processing tables. Fixed now
* **utf8\_general\_ci collation added to wpDataTables created tables**. Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and other UTF-8 characters in column names shouldn’t be a problem any more.
* **“Clear filters” problem solved**. Before when users clicked on “Clear filters” some dropdown values weren’t refreshed.
* **Default value dropdown problem solved**. Previously if you defined a default value for a dropdown selectbox it didn’t work, fixed now.
* **WP 4.0.1 compatibility checked**.

## Version 1.5.3 (released 22.09.2014)

**Again, a relatively minor update with a bunch of frontend & backend improvements, bugfixes and new features. New in this version:**

* **WordPress 4.0 compatibility checked**. This site is running WP 4.0 so you can see plugin’s working.
* **Plugin settings won’t be reset after update any more.** Previous versions had a problem that after each update you had to define the settings again (colors, MySQL login parameters, etc), now it won’t happen.
* **“Steps” in the backend have been merged:** you still can define table and column settings separately, but now there are no separate save buttons for these parts, save procedure has been unified, since two separate save buttons caused confusion for some users.
* **Thing that many users asked for:** if you change something in the data source (reupload the file, change the SQL query, etc) you won’t have to redefine the column settings for the columns that existed previously. This should make the work with plugin easier I hope.
* **Browse page rewritten based on native WordPress admin interface** – now it’s paginated, sortable, searchable, bulk actions are supported. Number of tables per page can be defined on the plugin settings page. Should be much more convenient now for these of you who have more then several wpDataTables in the system; also deleting several tables at once is much easier now.
* **Dropdown advanced filters on mobile devices fixed** (weren’t rendering on iPhones, iPads, etc).
* **Front-end editing without advanced filter enabled bug fixed.**
* **Added support for attachments for new entries** since many people asked for it. Be careful with this since if a file for new entry was uploaded, and entry won’t be saved, file will stay in wp-upload folder.
* **A new table setting: “hide table until page is completely loaded”.** Now if you want you can disable table from showing until the page finishes loading, so it won’t flash without pagination, filters, etc.
* **CSS class per column is now supported:** you can assign each column a CSS class now.
* **Custom JS setting added:** now if you need to insert some custom JS related to tables you don’t have to modify the files directly.
* **Custom CSS setting added:** now if you need some styling related to tables you don’t have to modify the files directly.
* **“Re-upload” bug fixed:** before, when users uploaded an attachment, then edited this entry and saved it again, link was truncated, which doesn’t happen any more.
* **Apostrophe/quote in column headers, or possible values, or in default value caused a slash to be added, and caused some problems.** Fixed now.
* **“Possible values” input disappeared when “Save table” button was pressed; fixed now.**
* **Row deleting and file deleting for external MySQL DB fixed.**
* **Settings for “Tablet width” and “Mobile width” added**: now users can define what screen width should toggle the responsiveness for the table, so you can also have responsive/collapsible effect on desktops.
* **Setting for right-aligning columns with numerical data.** Users can define with toggling the checkbox whether they need that.
* **Date parsing in Excel fixed.** Since it’s a resource consuming operation, a setting in config file added, where you can define whether you need it or not. Enabled by default.
* **Setting for parsing shortcodes in string columns added to config file** (I guess it’s too “technical” to be in GUI). You can set it to true if you want wpDataTables process shortcodes contained within cells. Please keep in mind that this is quite resource consuming and may cause long execution time. Disabled by default.
* **Tiny bug with column reordering fixed.**
* **Deprecated uploader fixed with cute WP Media Library.**
* **“None” editor input type added.** You can use it now when you need to prevent front-end users from editing some of the cells.
* **jQuery compatibility fix** – all deprecated function calls upgraded so plugin would work with 1.11.
* **JSViews is now used in plugin backend for templating.** Should not make much difference for end users, but makes further implementation much easier.

## Version 1.5.2 (released 03.08.2014)

**A (relatively :)) minor update with a lot of structure changes, backend improvements, bugfixes and new features. New in this version:**

* **PDF Documentation** – starting from now on wpDataTables also includes a detailed PDF documentation (also available online) with a detailed description of all the features.
* **Reorganization of files** – files in wpDataTables plugin are now reorganized. Now each block of actions has its own controller and folder, so it’s easy to find if you need to change something. Also, all “.inc” files are changed to “.inc.php” for the servers that do not allow non-standard file extensions.
* **Hooks and filters** – now there are 70 WordPress actions and filters used in the plugin – so you can extend the plugin for your needs without any worries that the changes will be overwritten with next versions. Detailed descriptions are in the documentation in [Actions](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/information-for-developers/hooks/) and [Filters](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/information-for-developers/filters/).
* **Backend design changes** – wpDataTables got a better admin panel design, and some usability improvements.
* **Duplicate table** – Now you can easily create a duplicate of each table you want, using a “Duplicate table” button on the browse section of the admin panel. This can be handy if you need to have several similar tables.
* **Shortcode attributes and placeholders** – Now each wpDataTable shortcode can have up to three variables, which you can use in MySQL query or default filter values E.g. if you set the shortcode like wpDataTable with provided ID not found! you can use placeholders %VAR1% and %VAR2% in the table setup. This might come in handy if you want to e.g. have one table with different predefined filter values on several pages.
* **Default values for the column** – Now each column can have predefined default values that will be used in the advanced filter, and in the editor for the editable tables.
* **Empty tables are now editable** – Before you couldn’t edit a table after you delete all rows from it. This issue is fixed now (but please keep in mind that the MySQL table should have a couple of rows when you create an editable wpDataTable based on it).
* **Internationalization support** – Now wpDataTables plugin supports .PO/.MO internationalization. “languages” folder contains the subfolders for current locale.
* **Front-end editing restriction for selected roles** – As of this version when defining a table as editable you can select user roles that will be able to edit each table. Or you can leave this setting blank if you want to allow editing for everyone (as it was before).
* **Clear filters** – Widget filter now has a “Clear filters” button which refreshes all the filter settings.
* **Checkboxes filter bugfix** – problems with checkbox filter fixed.
* **Empty dates bugfix** – front-end editor had problems with empty dates, which are fixed now.

## Version 1.5.1 (released 07.06.2014)

**An update with several fixes and new features. New in this version:**

* **Word wrap bug fixed** – there was a bug in version 1.5 when word wrapping didn’t work. Fixed now.
* **Dropdown filter bugfixes** – There were some cases with special characters causing problems with dropdown filter, which are now solved.
* **Date formats** – Some date formats caused problems with editable tables, this problem is fixed now.
* **Placement of edit/new/delete buttons** – Buttons were shown below the table when TableTools weren’t initialized. The problem is fixed now.

## Version 1.5 (released 21.04.2014)

**A major update. Lot of new stuff. New in this version:**

* **More responsiveness** – we replaced all jQuery UI dialogs and datepicker with responsive popups which would make both mobile and desktop experience of working with the tables nicer.
* **General redesign** – we’ve done a big job on redesign – now tables have a modern flat design, all icons and preloder use font icon, all selectboxes and checkboxes have nice neat look.
* **Skins** – Now tables have two skin options: a new one, and a second one if you liked old table design more.
* **More customization options** – We added some customization options – e.g. you can now style the buttons, change the round botder radius, and change the overlay color for the popups.
* **Filter in a form or widget** – Starting from this version you can put the advanced filter outside of the table – in a widget in a sidebar ([see demo](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/advanced-filtering/#filter-widget)) or just above the table ([see demo](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/advanced-filtering/#advanced-filter)).
* **Redesign of admin panel** – Admin panel now is also nicer and has animated popups.
* **Ungroup button** – Many people asked for it, so we added it. Now if you grouped the rows by mistake you can ungroup them.
* **Fixes for date columns** – There were known issues with sorting dates in european format, now these are fixed.
* **Fixed headers and columns discontinued** – This feature rarely worked well and usually just made problems both for users and for the developers. So we finally decided to remove it.
* **WordPress 3.9 compatibility checked and approved working** – there were some issues with MySQL after last WordPress update, now these are fixed.

## Version 1.4.1 (released 16.02.2014)

**An update with several fixes and new features. New in this version:**

* **Checkbox advanced filtering** – Now you can filter the data with checkboxes, this way you can select more then one possible value. Check out this [demo](https://sandbox.wpdatatables.com/wp-admin/)!
* **Preview bug fixed** – There was a bug in back-end preview, it was not working with responsive mode enabled. It works now.
* **Date formats** – A couple of new date formats added in the plugin settings, also the date format takes effect now in the front-end editor.
* **Date filtering** – A couple of bugs regarding date-range filtering, and filtering in responsive mode fixed.

## Version 1.4 (released 30.01.2014)

**A major update. Lot of new stuff. New in this version:**

* **Responsive mode added** – Now any of your wpDataTables can be responsive. Check the [demo](https://sandbox.wpdatatables.com/wp-admin/)!
* **UI improvements** – animated AJAX processing indicator for tables with server-side processing, some small CSS issues fixed, transitions added for smooth feel.
* **Client side optimized** – javascript part completely rewritten and minified, so now tables are rendered quicker.
* **WordPress 3.81. compatibility checked** – everything works fine as you can see on this site which is running WP 3.8.1 now.

## Version 1.3.1 (released 16.01.2014)

**A minor update. Mostly bugfixes. New in this version:**

* **WordPress 3.8 compatibility checked** – everything works fine as you can see on this site which is running WP 3.8 now.
* **Front-end editing bugfix** – There was a bug caused by one of the JS plugins update which was throwing an exception and broke front-end editing. Fixed.
* **Server-side processing pagination bugfix** – in some cases previous/next buttons were not working for server-side tables. Fixed now.
* **Back-end table preview bugfix** – In some cases back-end preview broke when called more then once. Fixed.
* **Current user ID placeholder fixed** – working as it’s supposed to now.
* **Several minor bugfixes** – too small to mention them.

## Version 1.3 (released 06.12.2013)

**A major update. New in this version:**

* **Front-end data editing for MySQL-based tables**. Editing, deleting and inserting new rows from the site front-end. Editing, deleting and inserting new rows from the site front-end. You can select an editor input type for your rows – text inputs, textareas, datepickers, file uploads and many more supported. For now the front-end editing is only supported with these limitations: **1) MySQL-tables only; 2) Server-Side processing should be enabled; 3) Only one table can be edited with the wpDataTables plugin.** See the related documentation page and the demo site for details.
* **Placeholder for current user ID.** I received many requests for using the current user ID in the MySQL query which creates the table, so implemented it. Now you can put **%CURRENT\_USER\_ID%** placeholder in the query, and it will be replaced with the real ID value when executed.
* **Setting default sorting column and sorting direction.** Now you can choose which column will be used for sorting on page open, and in which direction (ASC/DESC).
* **Selectbox filters for server-side based tables**. Now selectboxes are also available for server-side based MySQL tables, but you have to specify all the values.
* **Updated and tested with WordPress 3.7.1** – keeping up-to-date with WP 🙂

##

## Version 1.2 (released 30.08.2013)

**A major update. New in this version:**

* **New style customization features**. No more CSS tweaking, you can choose the colors and fonts in the plugin settings!    ![](https://wpdatatables.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1111-300x174.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml...)
* **Preview feature**. Now you can preview from the admin panel any table that you prepare before you insert in the post or page.

  ![](https://wpdatatables.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2222-300x230.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml...)
* **Better Excel files processing**. The Excel file load procedure has been rewritten. Now it won’t crash on bigger files (if your server resources allow that), and will work a little bit faster. Though still it will take a while for big files to load, and the pages where you put the files will open slowly, so for big datasets consider MySQL tables.
* **A sandbox demo site.** I’ve set up a demo site, with a demo admin panel access, where you can try how the plugin works before you buy it. The site, and the uploaded files are flushed once an hour, but still – please don’t misbehave, or I will have to close it 🙂 The WP-admin panel is here: <https://sandbox.wpdatatables.com/wp-admin/>. Login and password: **demo / demo**
* **No-shortcode table including**. If your theme, or some plugins have problems with the shortcodes, or you would like to re-use one table in all pages of some template, you can include it by a PHP function call in the template file like this: **<?php echo wdt\_output\_table( $table\_id ) >**
* **Better error handling**. No more mystic silence when something goes     wrong with the table generation. If an error happens on the server side you will get a nice dialog with info about the error, and possible solutions where applicable.**![](https://wpdatatables.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3333-300x140.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml...)**

* **Row hover feature.** Many users asked for it, so we added a feature to highlight a row on hover.
* **Better interaction with user.** Nice preloaders added and default JS alerts replaced with nice-looking jQuery UI dialogs.
* **Server-side processing bugs fixed** – no multi-filtering does not cause problems, also some minor bugs fixed.
* **Zero-length fatal error cured** – won’t bother you anymore.
* **Uninstall errors fixed.** I hope you won’t have to say goodbye to the plugin, but still for these who have to uninstall the fatal errors have been fixed.

## Version 1.1 (released 24.01.2013)

**New in this version:**

* The long-awaited **AJAX Server-Side processing for large MySQL-based datasets**. Demo and examples coming within few next hours.
* **Option in WP Admin for word-wrapping and fixed table layout style** – since there’s been a lot of requests how to fit table in the parent container, and how to enable word wrap, I added a feature in table settings, so you wouldn’t have to edit CSS every time.
* **Feature to render advanced filters in the header**. There’s been a lot of questions is it pvossible to put the filter in the header, so now there is a global setting for wpDataTables where to put it.
* Fixed the issue with MySQL queries with quotes.
* Fixed the bugs with checkboxes were checked again after saving.
* Fixed all short-style PHP tags.
* Several smaller bugfixes.
