The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24125.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `wpcf7_contact_form` GET parameter. This parameter is used to fetch available columns for a specific form ID, and if not properly sanitized, allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `wpcf7_contact_form` GET parameter.
- Insufficient input sanitization: The plugin was using `esc_attr()` which is inadequate to prevent SQL injection in this context and later `sanitize_text_field()` which also didn't fix the injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `wpcf7_contact_form` GET parameter via the `edit.php` page of WordPress admin panel when submitting a filter request.
- The vulnerable endpoint is accessible to high privilege users (admin+).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged in user with high privileges (admin+) to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious GET request with a SQL injection payload in the `wpcf7_contact_form` parameter.
