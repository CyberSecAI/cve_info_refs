- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Business Directory plugin failed to properly validate imported files, using a blacklist approach to forbid certain extensions, allowing the upload of files with extensions like `.php4`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated arbitrary file upload leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The plugin's import functionality did not adequately check file extensions, allowing an attacker to upload and execute malicious PHP code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with administrator privileges could exploit the vulnerability via the plugin's import feature by uploading a specially crafted zip archive containing a malicious `.php4` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator access to the WordPress site.
