Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24260:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the "Livemesh Addons for Elementor" plugin. Specifically, several widgets within the plugin allow users to specify HTML tags for text elements. The plugin doesn't properly restrict the allowed tags on the server side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code through parameters like `title_tag`, `plan_name_tag`, `entry_title_tag`, `heading_tag`, etc. These parameters should only accept specific HTML tags but, due to lack of sanitization, accept JavaScript code or arbitrary tags like `<script>`. This injected code is then stored in the database and executed when the page is viewed or previewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Site Takeover:** If an administrator views a page with injected malicious JavaScript, the attacker could potentially take over the site. This is because the JavaScript will execute within the administrator's browser session.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with Contributor permissions can inject malicious code. When an administrator reviews the post, the malicious code executes in the adminâ€™s browser. This would allow the attacker to potentially elevate their privileges.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Exploiting the XSS vulnerability could allow attackers to perform various malicious actions, including redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing session cookies, and defacing the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Widgets:** The primary attack vector is through the plugin's vulnerable widgets, including the "Heading", "Pricing Table", "Testimonials Slider", "Posts Carousel", "Portfolio", "Posts Gridbox Slider", "Posts Multislider", "Posts Slider", "Services", "Team Members", and "Testimonials" widgets.
*   **Manipulated HTTP Requests:** An attacker intercepts a request to save changes in the Elementor editor and modifies parameters like "title\_tag" to inject JavaScript or the `<script>` tag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account with Contributor or Higher Permissions:** An attacker needs a WordPress account with at least "contributor" level access to use the Elementor editor and inject the malicious code. This is a lower-privileged role than administrator, making the attack more easily achievable.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:**  The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters within the affected widgets.
*   **Ability to Manipulate HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify web requests.
