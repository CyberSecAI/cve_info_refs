- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to unsanitized user-controlled input (`$post_id`) being directly used in SQL queries on the `options.php` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated administrative user can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This could lead to data breaches, modification, or complete compromise of the database and the application itself.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered via the `options.php` page in the WordPress admin panel.
    -  The attack is performed by modifying the POST parameter `options[post]` with a malicious SQL payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in the WordPress instance.
    - They must be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
