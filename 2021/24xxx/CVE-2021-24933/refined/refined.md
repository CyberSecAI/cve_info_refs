Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-24933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Dynamic Widgets` plugin's failure to properly sanitize the `prefix` parameter before displaying it in an HTML attribute, when using the `term_tree` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.
- This code could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `term_tree` AJAX action available to any authenticated user.
- The attacker crafts a malicious request containing a payload in the `prefix` parameter.
- The server then reflects this payload back to the user within the HTML output, leading to code execution in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
- The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`
- The attacker must know the parameter names: `action`, `prefix`, `name`, `widget_id`, and `id`

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is in versions of the Dynamic Widgets plugin prior to 1.6.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79
- The CVSS score is 6.1 (medium) with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`
- A proof of concept is provided that demonstrates how an attacker could inject arbitrary javascript code.
