  "CVE-2021-24960": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The WordPress File Upload plugin before 4.16.3 allows stored XSS via malicious SVG files due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled upload patterns.",
    "details": "The plugin allows users with a role as low as Contributor to configure the upload form in a way that allows uploading of SVG files, which could be then be used for Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\nA contributor can add a shortcode to a post that allows uploading SVG files, which can then be used for XSS attacks. The vulnerable shortcode has the following format: [wordpress_file_upload uploadpatterns=\"*.svg\"]\nThe XSS can be triggered by accessing the uploaded SVG file directly in the uploads folder.",
    "affected_software": {
      "name": "WordPress File Upload Plugin",
      "versions": "< 4.16.3"
    },
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Inadequate Input Sanitization",
       "Improper Access Control"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a malicious SVG file uploaded via the plugin's file upload functionality, configured via a shortcode.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs Contributor or higher level access to the affected WordPress site. They need to be able to create posts.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient sanitization of upload patterns, allowing malicious SVG files containing JavaScript to be uploaded and executed. The plugin fails to properly blacklist SVG files."
