- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the 's' GET parameter before outputting it on the "All Masking Rules" page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable 's' GET parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript and trick a user into visiting it, or otherwise convince a user to click on the URL.
