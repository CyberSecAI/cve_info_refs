- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the `href` attribute within its shortcodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed in the context of the victim's browser when a page containing the crafted shortcode is viewed. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Malicious shortcode injection via a post/page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have contributor level access or higher on the WordPress site.
    - The attacker can create or edit posts/pages containing the vulnerable shortcodes.
