The provided content relates to CVE-2021-24317.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Listeo theme did not properly sanitize some parameters in its Search, Booking Confirmation, and Personal Message pages, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated Reflected XSS: Vulnerable parameters `keyword_search` and `location_search` in the search query.
- Authenticated Persistent XSS & XFS: Vulnerable parameters `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, `phone`, and `message` in the booking confirmation.
- Authenticated Persistent XSS & XFS: Vulnerable `message` parameter when sending personal messages (`action=listeo_send_message`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website.
- This could lead to session hijacking, user data theft, website defacement, or other malicious actions when a user visits the affected page.
- The XFS vulnerability could allow attackers to inject malicious content into frames, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated Reflected XSS: Sending crafted URLs with malicious payloads to the user, which when visited by the user, executes the injected scripts in the context of the target website.
- Authenticated Persistent XSS & XFS: Injecting malicious payloads through the specified parameters in booking confirmation or personal message forms. These payloads are then stored and executed when the data is displayed on the page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For the Unauthenticated Reflected XSS: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a user to visit it.
- For the Authenticated Persistent XSS & XFS: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the website.

The content provides more detailed information than the official CVE description, including the specific vulnerable parameters and proof-of-concept exploit payloads. It also indicates that the vulnerability is fixed in version 1.6.11 of the Listeo theme.
