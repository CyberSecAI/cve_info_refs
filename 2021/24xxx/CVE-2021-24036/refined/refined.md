The provided content relates to CVE-2021-24036.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check when creating an `IOBuf` object within the Folly library. Specifically, an attacker-controlled size parameter could be passed during the creation of an `IOBuf`, leading to an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The primary vulnerability is an integer overflow when calculating the size of the buffer to allocate for the `IOBuf`.
- Out-of-Bounds Write: The integer overflow leads to the allocation of a small buffer than needed. Subsequent writes to the buffer will cause an out-of-bounds write on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: The out-of-bounds write can corrupt heap metadata or other critical data, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- Denial of Service: The vulnerability could also lead to application crashes or denial of service due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network as the size parameter is attacker-controlled through network input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the size parameter used in the `IOBuf` creation. This typically implies the ability to send specially crafted network messages.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Folly versions prior to v2021.07.22.00 and various HHVM versions prior to specific patches (4.80.5, 4.102.2, 4.113.1, 4.114.1, 4.115.1, 4.116.1, 4.117.1, 4.118.2)
- The fix involves adding additional overflow checks in the IOBuf allocation functions to prevent the integer overflow, as seen in the provided commit diff.
- The CVSS score is 9.8, with a network attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction required, and high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
