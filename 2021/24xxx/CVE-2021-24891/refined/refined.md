Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Elementor plugin's lightbox functionality not properly sanitizing user-controlled input, specifically within the `settings` parameter of the URL hash. The plugin decodes a base64 encoded JSON object from this parameter and uses values within that object to control how the lightbox is displayed. When the `type` parameter within this JSON does not match specific expected values (`video`, `image`, or `slideshow`), the plugin sets the HTML content of the lightbox directly using the value of an `html` parameter from the JSON, without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS. The plugin takes unsanitized input from the URL, specifically from the `html` parameter in the decoded JSON, and injects it directly into the DOM. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The primary weakness is the absence of proper input sanitization or escaping before inserting the `html` content into the DOM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit a vulnerable page.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:**  This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL Construction:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes the vulnerable `#elementor-action:action=lightbox&settings=` parameter.
*   **Base64 Encoded Payload:** The attacker's payload (JavaScript code) is placed within the `html` field of a JSON object, which is then base64 encoded. This base64 string is then included as the value of `settings` in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Targeted User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice the victim to click on or visit a link with the crafted malicious URL.
*   **Vulnerable Plugin Version:** The target site must be using a vulnerable version of the Elementor plugin (versions 1.5.0 up to but not including 3.1.4, and then again from 3.2.0 to before 3.4.8).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially fixed in version 3.1.4 but was reintroduced in version 3.2.0. The final fix was in version 3.4.8.
*   The provided content goes into detail on the code analysis and debugging steps the researcher took to identify the vulnerability, including how the base64 encoded JSON was processed and the vulnerable switch statement.
* The fix implemented by the developers was to remove the default case of the switch statement which allowed the `html` content to be rendered directly.

This information is consistent with the CVE description.
