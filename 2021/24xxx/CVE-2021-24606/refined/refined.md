- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize the `category` attribute from its shortcode before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding a crafted shortcode with a malicious category attribute to a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have an account with the ability to add shortcodes to posts/pages. This could be a contributor role or higher.
