- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `get_portfolios()` and `get_portfolio_attributes()` functions in the `class-portfolio-responsive-gallery-list-table.php` and `class-portfolio-responsive-gallery-attributes-list-table.php` files of the plugin did not sanitize or validate the `orderby` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user-controlled input in the `orderby` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `orderby` parameter in HTTP GET or POST requests sent to the WordPress admin panel. Specifically, requests to sort portfolios or portfolio attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user in the WordPress admin panel to access the vulnerable functionality. The CVSS score indicates the attacker needs to have "High" privileges.
