- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin did not properly escape, validate, or sanitize shortcode options, specifically the `align`, `width`, and `height` parameters of the `wpdevart_youtube` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the browsers of users visiting affected pages or posts. This can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacement, or information theft.
- **Attack vectors:** By using crafted `wpdevart_youtube` shortcode with malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable parameters in a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the Contributor role or higher. This is because the vulnerable shortcode can be added to posts and pages by users with these roles.
