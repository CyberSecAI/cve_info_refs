- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate or sanitize the `tab` parameter before passing it to the `include()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local File Inclusion (LFI).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to the execution of malicious PHP code if the included file is a PHP file.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with a `tab` parameter containing a path to a file outside of the webroot.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the `wp-admin/upload.php` page. High privilege access (such as admin) is likely required to access this page.
