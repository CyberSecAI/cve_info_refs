Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described as CVE-2021-24227:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization when serving patron-only images. Specifically, the plugin uses the `$_REQUEST['patron_only_image']` parameter to construct the path to an image without verifying if the requested file is within the intended upload directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can manipulate the `patron_only_image` parameter to access files outside of the intended uploads directory, leading to the disclosure of sensitive files such as `wp-config.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information, such as database credentials, secret keys, and other configuration data stored in files like `wp-config.php`, which can lead to a full site takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `patron_only_image` parameter in an HTTP request. The vulnerable code retrieves the image path from user-controlled input (`$_REQUEST['patron_only_image']`) and concatenates it into a file path without sufficient sanitization or validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the WordPress site. They can exploit the vulnerability simply by visiting the website and crafting a malicious request.
- **Knowledge of WordPress Directory Structure:** A basic understanding of the typical WordPress directory structure, particularly the location of `wp-config.php` and other sensitive files, would help the attacker in targeting specific files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code snippet shows the vulnerable function `servePatronOnlyImage`, which takes a potentially attacker-controlled image path, constructs a URL, and then serves that URL using `Patreon_Protect::readAndServeImage`.
- The code does attempt to get the attachment id, but fails to properly validate the full file path beforehand.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.0 of the plugin.
