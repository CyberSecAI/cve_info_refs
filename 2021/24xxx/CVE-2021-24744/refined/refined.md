The provided content relates to CVE-2021-24744.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Contact Forms by Cimatti" does not properly sanitize and escape the "Form Title" before outputting it in admin pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** A high-privilege user (Admin+) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Form Title." This script will be executed in the browsers of other users who visit the affected admin pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  An attacker with admin privileges navigates to the "Forms" section of the plugin's admin panel.
2.  The attacker creates a new form or edits an existing one.
3.  In the "Form Title" field, the attacker injects malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert("Ehlo");</script>`).
4.  The attacker saves the changes.
5.  When a user views the list of forms on the plugin's admin pages (e.g., `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=accua_forms_submissions_list` or `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=accua_forms_list`), the injected script executes in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator-level access or higher within the WordPress instance. The attacker needs to be able to create and edit forms within the "Contact Forms by Cimatti" plugin.
