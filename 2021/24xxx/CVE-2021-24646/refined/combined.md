## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Booking.com Banner Creator < 1.4.3 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize inputs when creating banners, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

\* Open the plugin's add new banner page (B.com Banner -> Add New Banner)
\* The form field named "Banner Copy" is vulnerable to XSS payloads like:
<--`<img/src=` onerror=alert(document.cookie)``> --!>
\* Update or Publish the page, and you will be provided a shortcode similar to [bdotcom\_bm bannerid="123"]
\* You will then need to create a page that includes the Banner's shortcode above.
\* Visiting the page with the banner's shortcode will trigger the XSS payload to execute,
