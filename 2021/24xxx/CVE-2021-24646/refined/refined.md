- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs when creating banners. Specifically, the "Banner Copy" field is vulnerable to XSS payloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high privilege user (Admin+) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the banner content. When a user views a page displaying the banner, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with high privileges can create a new banner, insert the malicious payload in the "Banner Copy" field, and then embed the banner using shortcode on a page which when viewed by a user will execute the XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be at least an administrator on the WordPress site.
