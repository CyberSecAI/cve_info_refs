## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WPFront Notification Bar < 2.1.0.08087 - Authenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitise and escape its settings, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

To execute the XSS on all frontend pages and plugin's setting page, add the following payload in the Message Text: <svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)>
To execute XSS in the backend, via the plugin's settings, add the following payload in any of the text field settings (such as Reopen Button Image URL, Keep Closed Cookie Name, Button Text, Button URL, Display on Pages, Landing Page Cookie Name): "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>

### Affects Plugins
