Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24601:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied settings before rendering them. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means the malicious script is stored in the plugin's settings and executed when a user views the affected areas (frontend pages, plugin settings page, and backend).
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** The plugin lacks proper input sanitization, allowing users to insert malicious scripts. The plugin also does not encode output to prevent the scripts from executing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the plugin settings.
- **Account Takeover:** With a successful XSS attack, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify the appearance or content of the website if the XSS is executed on frontend pages.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker can steal sensitive information if they manage to inject code that can access such information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Settings Pages:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts via multiple fields in the plugin's settings page (e.g., Message Text, Reopen Button Image URL, Keep Closed Cookie Name, Button Text, Button URL, Display on Pages, Landing Page Cookie Name).
- **Frontend pages:** By using Message Text, the attacker can make the XSS trigger on all frontend pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privilege User:** The attacker needs to be a high privilege user, likely an administrator, or a user with the ability to modify plugin settings.
- **Access to Plugin Settings:** The attacker needs access to the backend of the WordPress site and the plugin settings.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.0.08087.
- The provided CVSS score is 3.5 which is Low severity, which is unusual for stored XSS
- The description implies the XSS payload can be executed even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.
