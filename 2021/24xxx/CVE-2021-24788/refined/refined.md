- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin defines custom AJAX actions that, while requiring authentication, are available to all user roles, including subscribers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control. Authenticated users, including subscribers, can add, set, or delete arbitrary categories to posts.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker with minimal access (subscriber role) can manipulate the categories associated with posts, leading to potential content disorganization, miscategorization, or other malicious use of categories.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, using the vulnerable AJAX actions `bcat_set_category` and `bcat_del_category`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, even a subscriber account is sufficient for exploitation.
