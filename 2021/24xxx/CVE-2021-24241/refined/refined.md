  "CVE_data": [
    {
      "ID": "CVE-2021-24241",
      "Description": "The WordPress 'Advanced Custom Fields PRO' plugin, in versions before 5.9.1, is vulnerable to reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS). This is due to the plugin not properly escaping the generated update URL when outputting it in an attribute on the update settings page. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by manipulating the URL parameters, specifically the 'page' parameter in the 'edit.php' script. By encoding specific characters such as spaces and dots in a crafted URL, the injected JavaScript can be successfully rendered on the vulnerable page.",
       "Root cause": "Improper escaping of the generated update URL when outputting it in an HTML attribute.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Insufficient output sanitization"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
      "Attack vectors": "A crafted URL, specifically manipulating the 'page' parameter in the 'edit.php' script.",
       "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and entice a victim to visit the URL. No authentication is explicitly required for the reflected XSS to trigger, but the victim needs to be a logged in WordPress user to access the vulnerable page. The user needs to be at least an author to view the vulnerable page under `wp-admin/edit.php`."
