- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape CDN settings, allowing high-privilege users to inject JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the context of the victim's browser, leading to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has a high privilege user account on the affected WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=w3tc_cdn` endpoint with malicious JavaScript payloads in the `cdn_cnames[]` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a high-privilege user account (e.g. admin) on the affected WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
