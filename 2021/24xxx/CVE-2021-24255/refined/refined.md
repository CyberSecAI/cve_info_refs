**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of server-side validation of user-supplied HTML tag parameters in multiple widgets within the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin. Although the element controls list a fixed set of possible HTML tags, it's possible to send a 'save_builder' request with malicious JavaScript in the parameters. This unsanitized input is then output without escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Inadequate input sanitization
- Lack of server-side validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser when viewing, editing, or previewing a page containing the vulnerable widget.
- Potential for site takeover if the victim is an administrator.
- Privilege escalation if a contributor injects malicious code which is then reviewed by an administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted 'save_builder' request with malicious JavaScript in HTML tag parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to have access to an account with at least "contributor" privileges within the WordPress site, which allows access to the Elementor editor.
