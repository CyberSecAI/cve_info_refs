```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not validate uploaded files for digital products, allowing any file type, such as PHP, to be uploaded. Additionally, the absence of CSRF protection allows an attacker to make a logged-in admin upload a malicious PHP file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary File Upload",
    "Lack of CSRF protection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) can be achieved by uploading a malicious PHP file, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can upload a malicious file through the product upload functionality. Additionally, an attacker could also exploit the lack of CSRF by tricking a logged-in administrator into uploading a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the product upload functionality, which would typically require admin privileges or tricking an admin user to perform the upload. "
