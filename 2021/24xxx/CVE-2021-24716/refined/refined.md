- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape values set by users with access to adjust settings within wp-admin. Specifically, user-supplied input in the Main Slug and Category Slug fields under the plugin settings is not sanitized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would execute in the browsers of other users who visit the affected WordPress site. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to have an authenticated account with permissions to access the plugin settings. The attacker navigates to the settings of the plugin, specifically the 'Slugs/Permalinks' tab, and inserts malicious JavaScript code into the 'Main Slug' or 'Category Slug' input fields. This script will be stored in the database and executed when the settings page is accessed again or reloaded by other users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to modify the plugin's settings.
