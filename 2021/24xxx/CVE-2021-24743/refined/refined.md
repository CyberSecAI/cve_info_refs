- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user input when processing the `alignment` attribute of the `podcast_subscribe` shortcode, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes that can execute JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the lack of input sanitization of the shortcode parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage, which will execute in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites, among other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can add a malicious shortcode (e.g., `[podcast_subscribe alignment='" style="animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition" onanimationend="alert(origin)//']`) as a post or page content using the WordPress editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have Contributor+ level privileges to create or modify posts and add the vulnerable shortcode block.
