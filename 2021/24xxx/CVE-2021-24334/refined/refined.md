The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24334.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Instant Images WordPress plugin versions prior to 4.4.0.1 did not properly validate and sanitize the `unsplash_download_w` and `unsplash_download_h` parameters in its settings page. The plugin relied on client-side validation, which could be bypassed by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Due to insufficient sanitization of the `unsplash_download_w` and `unsplash_download_h` parameters, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the plugin's settings and executed when an administrator views the settings page.
*   **Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS):** The injected payloads also demonstrates the capability for XFS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser, leading to potential malicious actions. This could include stealing session cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing other admin actions on behalf of the logged-in admin.
*   XFS could allow an attacker to load content from a different domain within the vulnerable page.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/options.php` with malicious JavaScript code within the `unsplash_download_w` or `unsplash_download_h` parameters. This occurs on the settings page of the plugin at `/wp-admin/upload.php?page=instant-images`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must have administrative privileges to modify the plugin's settings to inject the malicious payload
