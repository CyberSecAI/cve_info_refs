Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-24726:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `orderby` parameter in the `Search Calendars` action of the WP Simple Booking Calendar WordPress plugin was not properly escaped, validated, or sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This lack of input validation allowed for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  The primary vulnerability is an authenticated SQL injection, where an attacker can manipulate the SQL query executed by the plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database
    - Modify data within the database
    - Potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, depending on database permissions and configuration.
   -  In the provided PoC, the impact is shown with a SLEEP command which can be used to test for the vulnerability and cause a denial of service, due to long execution times of the query on the database.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the WordPress admin interface by crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable `orderby` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have **authenticated access to the WordPress admin panel** with sufficient privileges to access the `wpsbc-calendars` page. This is specified as a "High" privilege requirement in the CVSS score.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.6 of the plugin. However, the fix was applied without bumping the version, so there might be two versions of 2.0.6, one vulnerable and the other with the fix.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Martin Vierula of Trustwave.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.8 (medium) with the vector string AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.
