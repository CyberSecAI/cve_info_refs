- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's slider import search feature fails to properly sanitize the `keyword` GET parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to actions being performed on behalf of the victim, such as stealing session cookies or redirecting to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `keyword` parameter, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince a victim to click a malicious crafted link.
