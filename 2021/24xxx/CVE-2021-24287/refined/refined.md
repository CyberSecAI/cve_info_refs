Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the plugin's settings page not properly sanitizing the `tab` parameter before outputting it back into the HTML. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This means the malicious script is injected through a request parameter (`tab`) and then immediately reflected back in the response, executing within the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Stealing of sensitive user information
    *   Other malicious activities based on the actions an authenticated user is able to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL that contains a malicious JavaScript payload within the `tab` parameter of the plugin's settings page.
*   The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link, or embedding the malicious URL in a way that the victim's browser would access it (e.g., via iframe).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, but they need to find a way to convince an admin or a user with sufficient privileges to click on the malicious link.
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and social engineer the user into clicking them.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable plugin is "Select All Categories and Taxonomies < 1.3.2"
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.3.2 of the plugin.
*   The provided Proof of Concept URLs demonstrate how to inject JavaScript into the `tab` parameter.
