- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simple Download Monitor plugin allows users with a role as low as Contributor to remove thumbnails from downloads they do not own. This is due to insufficient access control when handling thumbnail removal requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control (CWE-284). The vulnerability allows unauthorized modification of download resources by removing thumbnails.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A lower-privileged user (Contributor) can remove thumbnails from downloads they do not own, leading to data modification. This can impact the visual appearance of downloads and potentially disrupt the user experience.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending an AJAX POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `sdm_remove_thumbnail_image` and the `post_id_del` parameter set to the ID of the download post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in WordPress user with at least Contributor role. They do not need to own the download post they are targeting to remove thumbnails.
