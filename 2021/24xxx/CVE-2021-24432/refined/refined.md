- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `br_aapf_get_child` AJAX action in the Advanced AJAX Product Filters plugin does not sanitize the `term_id` POST parameter before outputting it, leading to reflected XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `br_aapf_get_child` and a malicious payload in the `term_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require authentication and can initiate the attack by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint. The user must also be tricked into triggering the request.
