Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The AccessPress Themes website was compromised, and malicious code was injected into the themes and plugins available for download from their site. The versions hosted on wordpress.org were not affected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Backdoor:** The injected code acts as a dropper for a webshell, giving attackers full access to the infected sites.
  - The dropper (`inital.php`) installs a webshell into `wp-includes/vars.php` as function `wp_is_mobile_fix()`.
  - The webshell is triggered by a specific user-agent string (`wp_is_mobile`) and eight specific cookies, which are used to assemble and execute a payload.
  - There's also an older variant of the backdoor directly embedded in `functions.php` without the user agent check.
- **Code Injection:** Malicious code is injected into the theme/plugin files to execute the dropper. This injection occurs in main plugin files or `functions.php`, by checking for `inital.php`.
- **Remote image loading:** The dropper phones home by loading a remote image, which also removes the dropper file after execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Site Access:** Attackers gain complete control over the infected websites, allowing them to:
  - Modify site content
  - Upload/download files
  - Execute arbitrary code
  - Potentially use the compromised site to attack other targets

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Vendor Website:** The initial attack vector is the compromised AccessPress Themes website, where modified plugins and themes were made available for download.
- **User Download:** Users who downloaded affected plugins or themes from the vendor's website and installed them on their WordPress sites became victims.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Compromise AccessPress Website:** The attacker needed to gain access to the vendor's website and inject malicious code into the plugin and theme files.
- **Knowledge of WordPress:** The attacker needed knowledge of WordPress structure to place the backdoor effectively and understand which files to modify.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to send requests with specific cookies and user agent to trigger the webshell after installation.

**Additional Details:**
- The compromise occurred in two phases: first plugins in early September 2021, then themes later in September 2021.
- The files downloaded from the vendor's website had uniform timestamps within the zip-archives, which indicates they were modified intentionally after their original release.
- The vulnerable plugins and themes are listed, including the affected versions and fixed versions where applicable.
- The article notes that the themes downloaded directly from WordPress.org repository are safe.
- The article recommends users migrate to a new theme if the listed themes have no fixed version, and to upgrade any affected plugin to its fixed version.
- Some plugins and themes have no known fix.

This information provides significant detail beyond the basic CVE description.
