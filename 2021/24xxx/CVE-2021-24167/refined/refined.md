- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "wts_web_stat_load_init" function in Web-Stat plugin makes an XMLHttpRequest to a third-party server, sending the site's "wts_web_stat_uid" (in the "wpid" parameter). The response to this request contains an API key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive data exposure (API key disclosure). The API key was accessible to unauthenticated users via a request to a third-party server. Furthermore, after a partial fix in 1.4.0 the API key was still visible in the source code to users with minimal permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use the disclosed API key to directly access the statistics admin dashboard hosted on a 3rd party site. This would allow unauthorized access to site analytics and potentially other sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Visiting a site running a vulnerable version of the plugin. Specifically, the vulnerability was triggered by the client-side Javascript making a request to a third party API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special capabilities are required, as the vulnerability was triggered by client-side javascript. The attacker only needs to visit a website running a vulnerable version of the plugin. With the partial fix, an attacker with subscriber permissions would also be able to see the API key in the source of the wp-admin panel.
