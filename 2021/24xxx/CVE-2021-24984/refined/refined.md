The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24984.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "WPFront User Role Editor" fails to sanitize and escape the `changes-saved` parameter before outputting it in the admin dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present due to improper handling of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to actions such as:
  * Cookie theft
  * Session hijacking
  * Defacement of the website
  * Redirection to malicious websites
  * Other malicious activities within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `changes-saved` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to trick an administrator into clicking on the crafted URL while logged into the WordPress admin dashboard. No prior authentication is needed for the XSS to occur as long as the administrator accesses the malicious URL while logged into their dashboard.
