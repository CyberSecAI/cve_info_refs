Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `likebtn_export_votes` AJAX action in the Like Button Rating plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing CSRF Protection:** The action is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:**  Any authenticated user, including subscribers with minimal privileges, can retrieve a list of email addresses, IP addresses, country, date, and item IDs of users who have liked content.

**Attack Vectors:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, even with low privileges (e.g., subscriber).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ease of exploitation via a simple `fetch` request.
* The vulnerability is classified as a Sensitive Data Disclosure and is mapped to OWASP A3 and CWE-200.
