Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24783:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of proper capability checks within the Post Expirator plugin. This means that the plugin doesn't adequately verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions, such as scheduling post deletions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to enforce proper access control, allowing users with lower privileges (Contributor role) to perform actions they shouldn't be authorized to do. This is a classic example of a broken access control vulnerability, where the system fails to verify the user's permission before executing the action.
- **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** Specifically, the plugin lacks the necessary checks when scheduling post deletions via AJAX requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** An attacker, with a Contributor role or higher, can schedule the deletion of any post on the WordPress site, even posts they do not own or manage. This can lead to data loss, disruption of content, or manipulation of site content.
- **Denial of Service:** Mass deletion of posts could potentially render the website unusable and impact user experience.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **AJAX Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted AJAX request to the WordPress server. The request includes parameters that specify the post to be deleted, the deletion date, and the type of expiry (delete).
- **Direct Access to Plugin Functionality:** The attacker directly interacts with the plugin's vulnerable functions by crafting a malicious AJAX request with the necessary parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress Contributor Role or Higher:** The attacker needs to have a user account on the vulnerable WordPress site with at least a Contributor role, as the plugin's flawed access controls enable such a low privilege user to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Basic Understanding of AJAX:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to make AJAX requests and how to manipulate parameters within those requests.
- **Access to Website:** The attacker needs to be able to access the website and make AJAX requests. This could be done through a web browser.
