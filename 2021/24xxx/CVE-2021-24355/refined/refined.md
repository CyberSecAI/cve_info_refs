Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of capability checks and an insufficient nonce check within the Simple 301 Redirects plugin's AJAX actions `simple301redirects/admin/get_wildcard` and `simple301redirects/admin/wildcard`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Missing Capability Checks:** The functions associated with the aforementioned AJAX actions did not verify if the user had the required permissions to perform those actions. This means any authenticated user, regardless of their role/privileges, could trigger the functions.
2.  **Insufficient Nonce Check:** While the functions implemented a nonce check, they were using the `wp_rest` action for validation, which is a REST-API nonce accessible to any authenticated user via the `rest-nonce` AJAX action in WordPress core. This allowed an attacker to easily generate a valid nonce.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker with an authenticated account on the WordPress site could:

*   **Retrieve the wildcard value:** By exploiting `simple301redirects/admin/get_wildcard`, an attacker could retrieve the current wildcard value that controls how broadly redirects are applied.
*   **Update the wildcard value:** By exploiting `simple301redirects/admin/wildcard`, an attacker could arbitrarily set the wildcard value. This could potentially lead to unexpected redirect behavior or allow the attacker to redirect a larger set of requests than intended.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the WordPress admin AJAX interface (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`).
*   The attacker needs to send a POST request to this interface, specifying the vulnerable action (`simple301redirects/admin/get_wildcard` or `simple301redirects/admin/wildcard`), a valid nonce, and any required parameters (like `toggle` in the update case).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have an authenticated account on the target WordPress website. Any user level will suffice.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, including a valid nonce.
