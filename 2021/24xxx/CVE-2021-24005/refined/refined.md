- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the usage of hard-coded cryptographic keys within FortiAuthenticator to encrypt configuration files, debug logs, and user passwords. These keys are the same across all appliances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded cryptographic keys, leading to an information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the configuration files or CLI can decrypt sensitive data like user passwords and configuration details using the known hard-coded key.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to gain access to the configuration files or CLI of the FortiAuthenticator appliance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires access to the affected files or access to the CLI to decrypt the information.
