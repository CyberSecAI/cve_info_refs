The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24522.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the ProfilePress plugin's widget for tabbed login/register was not properly escaping user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin was vulnerable to reflected XSS due to improper sanitization of user-controlled input within the tabbed login/register widget. The plugin also assigned \_POST parameters as \_GET parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to the takeover of user accounts including admin access.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted URL parameters or form submissions containing malicious JavaScript code. Specifically, the `tabbed-login-name` parameter in the URL or POST requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker only needs to craft a malicious URL or POST request and entice a user to visit it.
