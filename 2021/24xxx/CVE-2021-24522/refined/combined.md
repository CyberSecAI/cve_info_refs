## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ProfilePress < 3.1.11 - Unauthenticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in tabbed login/register widget

### Description

The plugin's widget for tabbed login/register was not properly escaped and could be used in an XSS attack which could lead to wp-admin access. Further, the plugin in several places assigned $\_POST as $\_GET which meant that in some cases this could be replicated with just $\_GET parameters and no need for $\_POST values.

### Proof of Concept

1. Add the registration shortcode to a page.
2. Add the tabbed login/register widget on the same page.
3. Visit the page logged out and add this to the end of the URL /?tabbed-login-name="><script>alert(1)</script>
This could also be replicated by posting to any page with the widget present, which would not need the registration shortcode to be present on the page.
