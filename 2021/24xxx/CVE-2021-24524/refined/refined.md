- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape the Donation Level setting within its Donation Forms. This allows for the injection of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Donation Level text fields. This code would be executed in the browsers of users who view a page or post embedding the affected Donation Form, when hovering over the donation level that contains the payload. The injected script could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges (Admin+) to modify the Donation Level settings of a Donation Form. The malicious code is injected through the Donation Level text field of a Donation Form settings page and is then executed when a user interacts with the affected field in the front-end.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator or similar high-level privileges on the WordPress site to access and modify Donation Form settings. They also need to have access to the WordPress admin dashboard.
