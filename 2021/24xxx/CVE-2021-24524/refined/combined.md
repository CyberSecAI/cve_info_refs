## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# GiveWP < 2.12.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin did not escape the Donation Level setting of its Donation Forms, allowing high privilege users to use Cross-Site Scripting payloads in them.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in any Donation Level Text field of a Donation Form (ie /wp-admin/post.php?post=9&action=edit&give\_tab=form\_field\_options#form\_field\_options): "onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//
Then view a page/post with the embed Donation Form and move the mouse over the related Donation Level the payload was injected in to trigger the XSS
