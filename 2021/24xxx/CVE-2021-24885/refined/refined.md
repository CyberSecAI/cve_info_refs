Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24885:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content directly references CVE-2021-24885 and describes a reflected XSS vulnerability in the YOP Poll plugin, aligning with the provided CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause lies in the plugin's failure to properly escape the `perpage` parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS, which means the malicious script is injected through a request and reflected back to the user's browser.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
     - Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
     - Potentially steal sensitive information (session cookies, etc).
     - Redirect the user to a malicious website.
     - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
     - Deface the website or alter its functionality.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious script in the `perpage` parameter. Specifically, the vulnerable URL is:
     `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=yop-polls&perpage="><svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)>`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker requires the ability to craft a malicious URL.
   - No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability (i.e., the attacker is an unauthenticated user).
   - The user needs to be tricked into clicking on the crafted URL. This could be done via:
     - Phishing emails
     - Social engineering tactics
     - A malicious link placed on a website, forum, etc.
