Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the plugin failing to properly validate and escape the `orderby` and `order` request parameters before using them in a SQL query when displaying the Snippets admin dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLI): The lack of sanitization of user-supplied input directly into a SQL query allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (accessing sensitive information)
    - Data modification (altering or deleting data)
    - Potential for privilege escalation by modifying user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is reachable through the WordPress admin panel via the `admin.php` page with the `page=hfcm-list` parameter.
- The vulnerable parameters are `orderby` and `order`.
- The attack is performed through HTTP GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator-level access or higher to the WordPress admin panel to access the vulnerable page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided proof of concept shows how to inject malicious SQL using `SLEEP` function to demonstrate the vulnerability and achieve a time-based SQL Injection.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.14 of the plugin.
- The CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium)
