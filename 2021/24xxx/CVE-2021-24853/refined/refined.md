- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks capability and CSRF checks when saving bulk QR Redirector settings via the `qr_save_bulk` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Broken access control: Any authenticated user, even a subscriber, can modify the redirect response status code of arbitrary QR redirects due to the lack of proper authorization checks.
    - CSRF vulnerability: The absence of CSRF protection allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the redirect response status code of QR redirects.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `qr_save_bulk` action and crafted parameters (e.g., `qr_redirect_response` and `post_ids`), an attacker can change the redirect behavior.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (even with minimal privileges like a subscriber).
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress admin-ajax.php endpoint.
