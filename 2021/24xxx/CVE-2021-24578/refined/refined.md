- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `match_day` parameter before outputting it on the Events backend page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This could lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:  By crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `match_day` parameter and tricking a user into visiting it through social engineering techniques or a malicious link. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious URL that injects the XSS payload. No special privileges are needed. The victim needs to visit the malicious URL while logged in to the WordPress admin dashboard.
