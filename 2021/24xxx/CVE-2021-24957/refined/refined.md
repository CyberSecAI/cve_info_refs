- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `artID` parameter is not escaped before being used in a SQL query within the `apvc_reset_count_art` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted AJAX request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `apvc_reset_count_art` and a malicious SQL payload within the `artID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (at least Subscriber role) to trigger the vulnerable AJAX action. The security nonce is also required for versions < 6.1.6.
