Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin not properly escaping the text argument within its shortcode functionality. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts injected through the shortcode arguments are stored in the database and executed when the affected pages are rendered.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input for the `url`, `text`, `target`, `rel`, and `class` attributes of the `easy_media_download` shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow attackers to:
- Inject malicious JavaScript code into the website.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Steal user session cookies.
- Perform actions on behalf of logged-in users.
- Modify website content.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the plugin's shortcode:
- Attackers can inject malicious code by crafting a shortcode with malicious JavaScript in the vulnerable attributes.
- This crafted shortcode can be added to posts or pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Contributor Role or Higher:** The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role on the WordPress website to be able to add/edit posts/pages and insert shortcodes.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Shortcode:** The attacker must be aware of the `easy_media_download` shortcode and its vulnerable arguments.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to construct malicious JavaScript payloads to inject.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Plugin:** Easy Media Download
- **Affected Versions:** Versions prior to 1.1.7
- **Fixed Version:** 1.1.7
- **CVSS Score:** 6.8 (Medium)
- **CWE:** CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))
- **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
