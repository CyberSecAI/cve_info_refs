The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24150.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flawed host check in the `likebtn_prx()` function of the Like Button Rating plugin. This function acts as a proxy and is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Insecure host check:** The plugin uses `strstr` to validate the host, allowing bypass by including `likebtn.com` as a substring within the target host (e.g., `likebtn.com.attackerwebsite.bla`).
  - **Unauthenticated access:** The `likebtn_prx` function can be called via an unauthenticated AJAX request.
  - **URL Parameter:** The target URL is passed via a Base64 encoded `likebtn_q` GET parameter.
  - **Redirect Following:** The plugin's `WP_Http::request` follows redirects, enabling exploitation of internal resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can make the server issue requests to arbitrary URLs, including internal services. By redirecting to a localhost service, attackers can obtain sensitive data stored on the server.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - The attack vector is a crafted GET request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=likebtn_prx` and a specially crafted Base64 encoded URL in the `likebtn_q` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no authentication, they can send a request to the vulnerable endpoint directly.
