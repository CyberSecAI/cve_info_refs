- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ARForms Form Builder plugin does not properly sanitize some of its settings, specifically within the From/Replyto Name field in the Email Settings, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database and later displaying it on the page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the victim's browser when they access the affected page within the WordPress admin panel. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have administrator-level or higher access to the WordPress admin panel to modify the plugin settings. They can then inject the malicious script into the From/Replyto Name field, which is part of the pluginâ€™s settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or a user with sufficient privileges to access and modify plugin settings.
