Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-24398:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization, escaping, or validation of the `id` parameter within the "Add new scene" functionality of the Responsive 3D Slider plugin. This unsanitized input is directly inserted into a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a time-based SQL injection (SQLi).
- The `id` parameter, when provided by the user, is directly concatenated into the SQL query without any sanitization.
- The vulnerability is present in the `/init.php` file of the plugin. Specifically, line 983.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- **Complete Compromise:** It could potentially lead to complete compromise of the application and the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a POST request to the `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=morpheus` endpoint.
- The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter of the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target WordPress site.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker should possess a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQLi.
- The vulnerable parameter is passed twice within the same function, which means that a sleep command will cause the total delay of the request to double (e.g., SLEEP(5) results in a 10 second delay).
- The vulnerable code block exists at lines 983 and 1211 in the init.php file of the plugin.
- The provided PoC includes an example of an exploitation using a time based blind SQL injection payload.
- The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin equal to and less than version 1.2.
- The issue was first disclosed to WPScan on May 9, 2021, and publicly disclosed on August 22, 2021.
- The CVE was assigned on June 10, 2021.
