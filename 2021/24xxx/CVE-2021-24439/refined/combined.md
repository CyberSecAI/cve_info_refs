## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Browser Screenshots < 1.7.6 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin allowed authenticated users with a role as low as Contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks as the image\_class parameter of the browser-shot shortcode was not escaped.

### Proof of Concept

Add the following shortcode in a page, then view the page (either published or as preview to trigger the XSS): [browser-shot url="https://example.com" image\_class='" onload="alert(origin)']

### Affects Plugins
