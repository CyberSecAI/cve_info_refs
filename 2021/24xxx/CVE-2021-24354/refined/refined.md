Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24354:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper capability checks and an insufficient nonce check within the `install_plugin` function of the Simple 301 Redirects plugin. This function is accessible via an AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Capability Check:** The `install_plugin` function does not verify if the user initiating the action has the necessary privileges to install plugins.
*   **Insufficient Nonce Check:** Although a nonce check exists using `check_ajax_referer('wp_rest', 'security')`, it uses the `wp_rest` action, which can be bypassed by any authenticated user by generating a valid nonce via the `rest-nonce` AJAX action in WordPress core.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:

*   **Arbitrary Plugin Installation:** Install any plugin available in the WordPress repository.
*   **Plugin Activation:** Activate any installed plugin, including those installed using the vulnerability or already present on the system.
*   **Further Compromise:** The attacker can install malicious plugins or plugins with known vulnerabilities to gain further control over the site, escalate privileges, or conduct further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Endpoint:** The attack leverages the `wp_ajax_simple301redirects/admin/install_plugin` AJAX action.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an authenticated user to generate a valid nonce.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site. No specific user role is mentioned, suggesting even low-privileged users can exploit this.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability affects versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.3 of the Simple 301 Redirects plugin.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.4.
* The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can log in, obtain a REST API nonce, and then use it to install the 'jetpack' plugin.
* This vulnerability is classified as "Broken Access Control" by OWASP and relates to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
* It has a CVSS score of 7.4 (High).
