- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin did not sanitize, validate, or escape the anchor attribute of its shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a website. When a user views the page with the injected code, the script executes in the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by adding a crafted shortcode with a malicious anchor attribute to a wiki page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs Contributor+ level access to create or edit wiki pages where the shortcode can be added. The attacker must be able to create or edit content.
