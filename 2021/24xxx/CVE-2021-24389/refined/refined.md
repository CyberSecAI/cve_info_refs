- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `foodbakery_radius` parameter was not properly sanitized before being output in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing the `foodbakery_radius` parameter with a payload that injects JavaScript code. The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking the crafted link to trigger the XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific access level, the attack can be performed remotely. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a victim into opening it.
