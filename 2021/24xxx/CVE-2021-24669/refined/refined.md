- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to validate or escape the `loader_id` parameter of the `mzldr` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89) due to lack of sanitization of user input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or complete compromise of the application and/or server. In the provided proof of concept, the vulnerability is used to retrieve user credentials (login and password hash) from the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious `mzldr` shortcode with a SQL injection payload in the `loader_id` parameter. This can be done by users with the "Contributor" role or higher.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least Contributor privileges in WordPress. They must be able to create or edit posts or pages where shortcodes can be inserted and rendered.
