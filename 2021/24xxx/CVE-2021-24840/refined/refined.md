- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Squaretype theme allows unauthenticated users to manipulate the `query_vars` parameter in a REST endpoint, without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and Broken Access Control. The vulnerability arises from a lack of authorization checks when processing user-supplied parameters in the `csco/v1/more-posts` REST endpoint. The `post_status` parameter within `query_vars` can be modified by an unauthenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can disclose private and scheduled posts by manipulating the `post_status` parameter to `private`.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-json/csco/v1/more-posts` endpoint, with the `query_data` parameter containing a modified `query_vars` object, specifically changing the `post_status` to `private`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need authentication. They only need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
