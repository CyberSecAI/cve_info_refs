- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's `product-shortcode.php` file was dumping the serialized `$_SERVER` superglobal variable, which contains environment variables. This occurred when the `[accessally_order_form]` shortcode was used on public-facing pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive Data Exposure via the disclosure of the `$_SERVER` superglobal variable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information contained in server environment variables.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could access any public-facing page containing the `[accessally_order_form]` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No login or administrator role is required; the attacker only needs to access a public-facing page with the vulnerable shortcode.
