The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24760.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Gutenberg PDF Viewer Block plugin does not sanitize and escape its block's attributes, specifically the URL of the PDF, which allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the PDF viewer block. When a user views a page containing this block, the injected code will execute in the user's browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities including session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, and performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag within the `pdf-viewer-block/standard` block of the WordPress plugin, where a malicious URL can be injected with javascript. This is stored in the WordPress database and executed when the page with the block is viewed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
A Contributor+ role within the WordPress site is needed to create or modify posts that utilize the vulnerable block. The attacker does not need to be an administrator.
