Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24031

**Root Cause:** The `zstd` command-line utility created output files with default permissions (typically world-readable) during compression or decompression. The correct file permissions, matching the input file, were only applied at the completion of the process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Default Permissions:** The vulnerability stems from creating output files with overly permissive default file permissions (e.g., 644 or rw-r--r--).
*   **Race Condition:** There was a race condition, where the file existed with insecure permissions until the compression/decompression was complete, allowing a potential attacker to access the file in that window before the correct permissions were set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read the contents of sensitive files that were being compressed or uncompressed.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could copy the file while it has relaxed permissions before the process completes and permissions are corrected.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system where `zstd` was being used could exploit this vulnerability if the files being compressed had restrictive permissions.
*   **Timing:** The attacker would need to be able to access the file during the brief window when it is created with the default relaxed permissions, before the compression or decompression process completed and permissions were corrected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local access:** Attacker needs to have an account on the system running the vulnerable zstd.
*   **Basic Unix/Linux skills:** Ability to list files, monitor process, access files, and recognize relevant permissions.
*   **Timing:** Ability to monitor the file system and access the file before the permissions are corrected.
* **Knowledge of zstd usage**: The attacker needs to know when the compression is happening to be able to exploit the race condition.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided Debian bug report ([#981404](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=981404)) includes a detailed example of how the vulnerability can be exploited, including a proof-of-concept scenario.
*   The bug was fixed upstream and addressed by the commit, where the permissions are set to 0600 immediately when the file is opened. This makes it harder to exploit the race condition. However, there was a follow-up report recommending using `open()` with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` to avoid the race condition.
*   The vulnerability was resolved in `zstd` version 1.4.1 and later.
* The Debian fix was backported to older version 1.3.8, for example,  `1.3.8+dfsg-3+deb10u1`
