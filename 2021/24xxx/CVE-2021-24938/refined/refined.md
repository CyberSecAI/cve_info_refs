- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `key` parameter of the `woocs_update_profiles_data` AJAX action before outputting it in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to actions like redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious payload in the `key` parameter of a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` and tricking a user to submit such request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to submit the malicious request, or trick them into visiting a specially crafted malicious link. Any authenticated user can trigger the vulnerability.
