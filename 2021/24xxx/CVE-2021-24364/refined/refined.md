- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The theme does not sanitize the `options` JSON parameter within its `tie_get_user_weather` AJAX action before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via both GET and POST requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint using the `tie_get_user_weather` action and injecting malicious code into the `options` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need authentication or special privileges and needs to entice a user to visit a crafted link.
