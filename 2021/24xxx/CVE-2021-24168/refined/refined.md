- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin failed to properly sanitize text fields when creating or editing a form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the email subject, and possibly other fields, were not sanitized, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with author or editor privileges could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed when an administrator views the affected form, potentially allowing for privilege escalation or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**:  By creating or editing a form and inserting the malicious payload into the email subject field (or potentially other text fields).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least author-level access to the WordPress site to create or edit forms using the vulnerable plugin.
