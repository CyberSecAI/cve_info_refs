- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape some attributes of the `mlcalc` shortcode before outputting them in the HTML, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:**  A user with Contributor role or higher can create malicious posts or pages using the vulnerable `mlcalc` shortcode and its attributes, injecting JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access to the WordPress site.
