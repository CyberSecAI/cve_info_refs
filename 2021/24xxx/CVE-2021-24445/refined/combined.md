## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# My Site Audit <= 1.2.4 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or escape the Audit Name field when creating an audit, allowing high privilege users to set JavaScript payloads in them, even when he unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed, leading to an authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue

### Proof of Concept

Create an audit with the following payload in the Audit Name field: "><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
Then view the 'All Audit' or 'Dashboard' (of the plugin) pages to trigger the XSS
