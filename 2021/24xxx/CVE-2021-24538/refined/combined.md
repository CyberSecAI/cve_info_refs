## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Current Book <= 1.0.1 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize user input when an authenticated user adds Author or Book Title, then does not escape these values when outputting to the browser leading to an Authenticated Stored XSS Cross-Site Scripting issue.

### Proof of Concept

1. Install WordPress 5.7.2
2. Install and activate Custom Book
3. Navigate to Tools &gt;&gt; Current Book and enter the XSS payload into the
Book and Author input field.
4. Click Update Options
5. You will observe that the payload successfully got stored into the
database and when you are triggering the same functionality at that time
JavaScript payload is executing successfully and we are getting a pop-up.
