```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize user input when an authenticated user adds Author or Book Title, and then does not escape these values when outputting to the browser.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious payload into the Book and Author input fields within the plugin's settings. The payload is then stored in the database, and executed when the plugin renders the page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site with the ability to access the plugin settings (likely an administrator or editor)."
