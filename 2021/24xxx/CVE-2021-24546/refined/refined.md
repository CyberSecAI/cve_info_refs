- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and validate the Conditional Logic of the Custom Visibility settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability due to lack of sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in the Conditional Logic settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the WordPress site, including data exfiltration, defacement, or further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A contributor-level user can create or edit a post and insert malicious PHP code within the Conditional Logic settings in the block editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in the WordPress site. They must be able to create or edit posts.
