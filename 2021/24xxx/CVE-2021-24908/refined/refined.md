Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24908:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape the `d` parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw. Input is taken from the `d` parameter in the URL and directly output in the HTML, without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application. This can lead to various attacks such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing user credentials
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `d` parameter.
*   The vulnerable URL structure is `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=check-email-logs&d=[malicious_code]`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL containing the exploit and trick a user with sufficient privileges (most likely a logged-in administrator to view the admin page).
*   The user must visit the crafted URL in their browser, which then executes the malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerable plugin is "check-email" with versions prior to 1.0.4 being affected
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.4 of the plugin.
* The researcher for this vulnerability is ZhongFu Su(JrXnm) of Wuhan University
* The CVSS score is 8.8 (High) with the vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
