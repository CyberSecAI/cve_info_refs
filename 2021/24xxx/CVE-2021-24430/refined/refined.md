The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24430.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Speed Booster Pack plugin did not properly validate the `caching_exclude_urls` and `caching_include_query_strings` settings before outputting them into a PHP file. This lack of validation allowed an attacker to inject malicious PHP code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Code Injection: The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied data when storing caching configurations, which enables the injection of arbitrary PHP code.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By injecting PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to gain control of the server, potentially leading to data breaches, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the WordPress admin panel via the `POST /wp-admin/admin.php?page=sbp-settings` endpoint.
- Specifically, the attacker crafts a malicious request including PHP code in the `sbp_options[caching_exclude_urls]` and `sbp_options[caching_include_query_strings]` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or have administrator-level privileges within the WordPress site.
