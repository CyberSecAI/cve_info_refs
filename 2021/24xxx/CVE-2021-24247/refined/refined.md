{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin settings are visible to all registered users in the dashboard and are lacking any sanitisation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Broken Access Control",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Any registered user, such as a subscriber, can inject an XSS payload in the plugin settings, which will be triggered by any user visiting those settings. This could allow for privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "By adding a form, then adding a field to the form, and inputting a payload in either the 'Field selector' or 'Field value' input fields.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs a registered account, even with low privileges such as a subscriber role."
