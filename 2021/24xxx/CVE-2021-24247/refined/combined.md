## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Contact Form Check Tester <= 1.0.2 - Broken Access Control to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin settings are visible to all registered users in the dashboard and are lacking any sanitisation. As a result, any registered user, such as subscriber, can leave an XSS payload in the plugin settings, which will be triggered by any user visiting them, and could allow for privilege escalation. The vendor decided to close the plugin.

### Proof of Concept

Register an account (subscriber role)
Navigate to the dashboard
Go to CF7 Check Tester -> Settings
Add a form, then add a field to the form
Put in a payload in either Field selector or Field value "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
