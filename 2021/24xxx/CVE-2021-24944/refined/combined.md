## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Custom Dashboard & Login Page < 7.0 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise some of its settings, allowing high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

Note: v6.9.5 made the settings only available to admin with the unfiltered\_html capability, however existing payloads were not sanitised and there was no simple way to remove them other than editing the settings directly in the DB.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "Change version text"or "Change footer text" setting of the plugin (/wp-admin/tools.php?page=ag-custom-admin%2Fplugin.php#admin-footer-settings): <img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered in all admin pages
