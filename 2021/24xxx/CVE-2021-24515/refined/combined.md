## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Video Gallery - Vimeo and YouTube Gallery < 1.1.5 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape the Title and Description of the videos in a gallery before outputting them in attributes, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues

### Proof of Concept

Add the following payload in the Title or Description of a Video added in a List/Gallery: "onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//
Then view the page/post with the embed gallery and move the mouse over the related video to trigger the XSS
If the theme used is TwentyTwentyOne, the following payload can be used to trigger the XSS with minimal user interaction: a" style="animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition" onanimationend="alert(/XSS/)//
