- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize the Title and Description of videos within a gallery before outputting them into HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser when they view the affected page/post. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with admin privileges can add a video to a gallery and insert malicious JavaScript into the title or description fields. When a user views the page/post with the embedded gallery, the XSS payload will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires administrator level access to the WordPress plugin. The attacker needs to be able to create or edit video entries in the gallery. The victim needs to view the page where the gallery with the malicious javascript is present.
