Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization, escaping, or validation of the `order_id` parameter within the WordPress Page Contact plugin before it's used in a SQL query. Specifically, the `wpc_hidden_field` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLI): The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically a time-based blind SQL injection. The plugin uses user-supplied input from the `wpc_hidden_field` parameter directly within a database query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability. The provided output from sqlmap demonstrates the ability to perform time-based blind SQL injection, allowing data exfiltration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the WordPress admin interface, specifically the `admin.php?page=wpagecontact-plugin` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is `wpc_hidden_field`, submitted as part of the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least "editor" privileges to access the vulnerable functionality. However, the codevigilant.com content indicates an administrator level access is required.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress server.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `/wpagecontact.php` at line 307
- The SQL injection is present in both the SELECT and DELETE query statements.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique.

This vulnerability is classified as a high severity issue with a CVSS score of 8.3.
