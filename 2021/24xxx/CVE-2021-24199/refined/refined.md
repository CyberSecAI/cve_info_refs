{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin does not properly sanitize the 'start' HTTP POST parameter when processing table list requests, which leads to SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CWE-89"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can access all the data in the database, potentially including sensitive information like WordPress credentials, and can gain access to the WordPress application. With admin access, the attacker can execute arbitrary code by installing or modifying plugins and themes.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the '/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' endpoint, specifically with the 'action=get_wdtable' and a malicious SQL payload in the 'start' parameter.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress interface. No special privileges are required, meaning even a low-privileged user can exploit the vulnerability."
