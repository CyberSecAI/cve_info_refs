- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize the Video Embed Code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin allows injection of malicious code into the video embed code field.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected course, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious code within the "Video Embed Code" field of a course.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user who has the ability to edit courses. The unfiltered_html capability does not need to be enabled for the exploit to work.
