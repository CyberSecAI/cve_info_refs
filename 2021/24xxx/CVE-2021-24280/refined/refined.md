Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24280:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `import_from_debug` function in the Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin deserializes user-supplied data without proper sanitization. This function is accessible via an AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PHP Object Injection:** The `import_from_debug` function takes a base64 encoded serialized string from the `data[debug_info]` parameter, decodes it, and unserializes the data using PHP's `unserialize()` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While the plugin itself did not contain readily exploitable magic methods, the article mentions that this vulnerability can be chained with the arbitrary plugin installation vulnerability to achieve remote code execution by installing a plugin with a usable magic method and crafting a complete POP chain.
*   **Complete Site Takeover:** By exploiting the PHP object injection vulnerability in combination with a crafted malicious plugin, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full site takeover.
*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** Through RCE, attackers could also create malicious files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   **AJAX Endpoint:** The vulnerable function is triggered by making a request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint and specifying the `import_from_debug` action.
*  **POST Request:** The exploit uses a POST request, sending the malicious serialized data via `data[debug_info]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges to trigger the AJAX action.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs to know about the `import_from_debug` AJAX action.
*   **Ability to Craft Serialized Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to craft serialized PHP objects that contain malicious payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The `wpscan.com` content provides a proof-of-concept exploit that demonstrates how to inject a PHP object.
* The `wordfence.com` content highlights the possibility of chaining this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities, notably the arbitrary plugin installation vulnerability.
