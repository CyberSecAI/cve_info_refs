Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2021-24202:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper server-side validation of HTML tags within several Elementor widgets. Specifically, the `header_size` parameter in the Heading widget, as well as similar parameters in other widgets like Column (`html_tag`), Accordion, Icon Box, Image Box and Divider, did not enforce a strict list of allowed HTML tags. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML, including `<script>` tags, by manipulating these parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript injected through these parameters is stored in the WordPress database and executed when a page containing the affected widget is viewed or previewed by another user.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue is insufficient input validation on the server-side. The plugin relied on client-side restrictions, which could easily be bypassed.
*  **Insufficient output escaping:** While output escaping may prevent some XSS, it is not sufficient in the cases where the injected text is placed directly inside the injected HTML tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Site Takeover:** If an administrator views a page with injected malicious JavaScript, the attacker could leverage the administrator's session to create a new malicious administrator account or inject backdoors, leading to complete site takeover.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive data, modify content, or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could distribute malware to site visitors through the injected scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The attacker manipulates the `save_builder` request to include the malicious script within the `header_size` or similar parameters of the affected widgets. The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates the request structure.
*   **Elementor Widget Manipulation:** Specifically, vulnerable widgets are:
    *   Heading (`header_size`)
    *   Column (`html_tag`)
    *   Accordion
    *   Icon Box
    *   Image Box
    *   Divider (`html_tag`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account with Contributor or higher permissions:** The attacker needs a WordPress account with at least Contributor-level permissions to access the Elementor editor and create/edit pages or posts.
*   **Access to Elementor Editor:** The attacker needs to be able to use the Elementor editor to add or edit content.
*   **No interaction required from victim:** The XSS is triggered once the page is loaded or previewed by any user, including administrators or editors.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability impacts Elementor versions prior to 3.1.4.
*   The initial patch in 3.1.2 was insufficient, and additional fixes were included in 3.1.4.
*   The issue was responsibly disclosed by Wordfence.
*   A firewall rule was deployed by Wordfence (premium users initially, then free users after 30 days) to block the exploit.
