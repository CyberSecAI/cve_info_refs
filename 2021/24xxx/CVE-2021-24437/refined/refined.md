Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to sanitize or escape user-supplied input before displaying it within the response. Specifically, the `json_result_url` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization/escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser session. This can lead to:
    - Account takeover
    - Defacement of the website
    - Data theft
    - Malicious actions performed on behalf of the administrator

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL that contains JavaScript code in the `json_result_url` parameter, which is then reflected in the response without being properly sanitized or encoded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking on the crafted malicious URL. This can be done through various means, such as social engineering, phishing emails, or compromised websites.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges beyond being able to craft a URL.

**Technical Details:**

- **Affected parameter:** `json_result_url`
- **Vulnerable URL example:** `https://example.com/wp-admin/themes.php?page=favicon-by-realfavicongenerator%2Fadmin%2Fclass-favicon-by-realfavicongenerator-admin.phpfavicon_appearance_menu&json_result_url=%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain)%3E`
- The provided example uses an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event handler to execute JavaScript when the image fails to load.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.22 of the plugin.
- The issue was reported to the vendor in June 2021, escalated to WordPress due to a lack of response, and publicly disclosed in July 2021 after no resolution.
