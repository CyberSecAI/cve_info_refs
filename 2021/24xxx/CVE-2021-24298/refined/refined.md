Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24298:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization, validation, or escaping of the `share` and `method` GET parameters within the "Simple Giveaways" plugin. These parameters are directly output back into the page, creating a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed in the victim's browser.
- This can lead to various attacks such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - Defacing the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `share` or `method` GET parameters.
- The attacker then lures a user into clicking the malicious link, or embeds it into a website.
- When the user visits the crafted URL, the vulnerable script is rendered on the victim's browser which will execute the malicious script

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious payloads.
- The attacker needs to find ways to get the victim to click on the link.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `giveasap-template-functions.php` around line 355.
- The fix involves proper escaping of the `share` parameter as seen in the provided link to the fixed code.
- The vulnerability affects Simple Giveaways plugin versions prior to 2.36.2.
