- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The UpdraftPlus plugin fails to sanitize the `updraft_service` setting, which allows users with high privileges to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected settings page.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with malicious JavaScript in the `updraft_service` setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a high-privilege user (Admin+) to inject the malicious payload.
