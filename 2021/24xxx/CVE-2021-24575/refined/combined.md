# WPSchoolPress < 2.1.10 - Multiple Authenticated SQL Injections

In action "getstudentdate", The plugin did not properly sanitize and escape the $catid variable which is retrieved from $\_POST['data'] this action can be targeted by any authenticated user.
In action "AddStudent", The plugin did not properly sanitize and escape the $id variable which is retrieved from $\_POST['Class'] this action can be targeted by teacher+ user.
In action "addMark", The plugin did not properly sanitize and escape the $flid variable which is retrieved from $\_POST['exmarks'] this action can be targeted by teacher+ user.
In action "savetimetable", The plugin did not properly sanitize and escape the $day variable which is retrieved from $\_POST['day'] this action can be targeted by teacher+ user.
