- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or use prepared statements before using POST variables in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries that could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via HTTP POST requests to vulnerable endpoints that process user-supplied input, specifically in the following actions: `sendSubMessage`, `UpdateStudent`, `getstudentdate`, `AddStudent`, `addMark`, `savetimetable`, and `AttendanceEntry`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user, with the required level depending on the action targeted. Some actions can be targeted by any authenticated user (including simple subscribers/students), while others require teacher or higher level access.
