## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Site Reviews < 5.13.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise some of its Review Details when adding a review as an admin, which could allow them to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

As an admin, create a review via the Admin dashboard (/wp-admin/post-new.php?post\_type=site-review) and add the following payload in the Name/IP Address fields of the Review Details section: <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
The XSS will be triggered when viewing the Reviews list table in the admin dashboard
