Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24392

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `club-management-software` WordPress plugin. The `id` parameter from the GET request is not properly sanitized, escaped, or validated before being used in a SQL query. Specifically, the code at `admin/section/swiftbook-add-email-templates.php#30` directly uses the `$_GET['id']` value in a SQL query without any sanitization:

```php
$template = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT * FROM `$table_emailtemplate` WHERE `et_id`=" . $_GET['id']);
```

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization of user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, other plugin/site data.
*   It could lead to data modification or deletion.
*  The attacker can potentially gain full control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=swiftbook_add_email_template`).
*   **`id` parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `id` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress site to access the vulnerable page (`wp-admin/admin.php?page=swiftbook_add_email_template`) and exploit the SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is located in `admin/section/swiftbook-add-email-templates.php` at line 30.
*   The vulnerable query is `SELECT * FROM `$table_emailtemplate` WHERE `et_id`=" . $_GET['id']`
*   The exploit can be done by crafting a URL such as:  `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=swiftbook_add_email_template&id=0 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,user(),NULL,NULL--`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin was closed on June 10, 2021.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on July 23, 2021.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.7 (Medium).
