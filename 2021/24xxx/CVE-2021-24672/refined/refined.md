- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize the `link` and `target` attributes of its shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized user-supplied input in shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when the page containing the vulnerable shortcode is visited. This could lead to a wide range of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker uses the vulnerable plugin's shortcode feature by injecting malicious JavaScript into the `link` and `target` attributes. The malicious code is stored in the database and executed when a user visits a page containing the shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to insert shortcodes.
