Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a URL with a malicious script within the "a" parameter. When a user clicks on the social share button, the malicious script is executed within the context of the user's browser.
