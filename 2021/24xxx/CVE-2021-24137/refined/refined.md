- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Blog2Social WordPress plugin versions before 6.3.1 are vulnerable to SQL Injection via the "Re-Share Posts" feature. Specifically, the `postId` parameter within the `b2s_delete_re_post_sched` action is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated SQL Injection vulnerability exists. The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `postId` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. This can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the database, and potentially allow for further malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint. The vulnerable `postId` parameter is sent through the POST data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be an authenticated user of the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. They would need to have access to the WordPress admin panel.
