The provided content relates to CVE-2021-24985.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `field_name` and `field_type` parameters before outputting them in HTML attributes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `add_field_to_form` and malicious values for `field_name` and `field_type` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint. The user needs to be tricked into submitting the crafted form, meaning the attacker must be able to get the user to click a malicious link or otherwise visit a malicious page with the form to be submitted.
