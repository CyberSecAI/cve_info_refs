- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF checks for certain administrative actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Modification of plugin settings.
  - Denial of Service (DoS).
  - Arbitrary image conversion.
  - Modification of the website's .htaccess file by injecting malicious regex patterns leading to a malformed .htaccess file and potential DoS.
  - Conversion of files in arbitrary directories on the server via `convert_old_images` AJAX action.
- **Attack vectors**:
  -  Submitting crafted forms via a user's browser, while the user is logged into the WordPress administration panel.
  - The provided PoC targets the `upload.php` and `admin-ajax.php` endpoints with specific parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  -  The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a malicious form, usually through a crafted link or website.
