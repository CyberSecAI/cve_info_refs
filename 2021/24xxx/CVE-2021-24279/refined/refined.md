Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-24279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure implementation of the `import_from_debug` AJAX action in the "Redirection for Contact Form 7" plugin. This function lacks both capability checks and nonce protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure AJAX Action:** The `wp_ajax_import_from_debug` action is accessible to any authenticated user, including those with minimal privileges like subscribers, because it lacks capability checks.
*   **Missing Nonce Protection:** The function does not implement nonce verification, allowing an attacker to perform the action without a valid nonce.
*   **Arbitrary Plugin Installation:** The `import_from_debug` function unserializes user-supplied data that includes a list of plugins to install, which can be any plugin from the WordPress repository and can install/activate the plugin using `install_plugins()` and `install_plugin()` methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Plugin Installation:** A low-privileged attacker (e.g., a subscriber) can install any plugin from the WordPress repository. This can lead to the installation of malicious plugins containing backdoors or other vulnerabilities that could compromise the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network/Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests.
*   **AJAX Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted AJAX request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, triggering the vulnerable `import_from_debug` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, with at least subscriber-level access.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `import_from_debug` function within the Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.3.4 of the plugin.
*   The attacker provides base64 encoded serialized data as a `data` parameter in the AJAX request, which includes a list of plugins to install.
