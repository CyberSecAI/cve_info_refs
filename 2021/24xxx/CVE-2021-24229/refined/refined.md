The provided content relates to CVE-2021-24229.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of a parameter used in the 'patreon\_save\_attachment\_patreon\_level' AJAX endpoint before being printed back to the user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. If the victim is an administrator, the attacker can potentially take complete control of the site.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves tricking a user with 'manage_options' privilege (typically an administrator) into visiting a booby-trapped link. The malicious link would trigger the vulnerable AJAX action and inject the XSS payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link containing JavaScript code and must trick an administrator into clicking it. The vulnerability is triggered via an AJAX endpoint, and the vulnerable parameter is part of a form.
