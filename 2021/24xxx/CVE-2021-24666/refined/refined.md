Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24666

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Social & Donations" module of the Podlove Podcast Publisher WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `id` and `category` parameters used in the `/podlove/v1/social/services/contributor/` REST route are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `id` or `category` parameters, an attacker can manipulate the database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the WordPress database, such as usernames, passwords, and email addresses stored in the `wp_users` table, as demonstrated in the provided PoC.
- **Data Modification:**  Beyond reading data, an attacker might also be able to modify or delete data from the database.
- **Potential for Full System Compromise:** In severe cases, successful SQL injection can lead to full system compromise by gaining access to the underlying database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP REST API:** The vulnerability is exposed through the WordPress REST API, specifically the `/podlove/v1/social/services/contributor/` route.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- The "Social & Donations" module of the plugin must be enabled.
- The attacker does not need any prior user account on the WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code resides in the `contributor_service.php` and `show_service.php` files of the plugin's `social` module, which directly uses the provided `id` and `category` parameters in SQL queries.
- The `contributor_service.php` file has the following vulnerable code:
```php
return self::all('WHERE service_id IN (SELECT id FROM '.Service::table_name()." WHERE `category` = '".$category."' ) AND `contributor_id` = ".$contributor_id);
```
- The `show_service.php` file has the following vulnerable code:
```php
return self::all('WHERE service_id IN (SELECT id FROM '.Service::table_name()." WHERE `category` = '".$category."' ) ORDER BY position ASC");
```
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows how to exploit this vulnerability using a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract user data by injecting into the `id` and `category` parameters.

**Additional Notes**
- The issue was fixed in version 3.5.6 of the Podlove Podcast Publisher plugin.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.8 (Medium).
- This vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')).
- The commit that fixed the issue is [aa8a343a2e2333b34a422f801adee09b020c6d76](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/commit/aa8a343a2e2333b34a422f801adee09b020c6d76).
