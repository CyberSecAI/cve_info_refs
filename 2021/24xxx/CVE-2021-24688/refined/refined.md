- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks in its AJAX calls, specifically the `or_delete_filed` action. Additionally, the AJAX calls do not verify if the post belongs to the user or if the user is allowed to perform actions on it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Broken Access Control: Unauthenticated users can trigger actions intended for authorized users.
    - CSRF vulnerability: Lack of CSRF protection allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
    - Insufficient Authorization: The plugin doesn't properly verify user permissions before allowing actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary post deletion. An unauthenticated attacker can delete any post on the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action parameter set to `or_delete_filed` and the `or_pf_id` parameter set to the ID of the post to be deleted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges. They only need to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the specified endpoint.
