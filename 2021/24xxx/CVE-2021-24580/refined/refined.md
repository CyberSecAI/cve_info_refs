Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The plugin "Side Menu Lite" does not properly sanitize user input from the List page in the admin dashboard before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability. Specifically, the `s` parameter in the `POST` request is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (accessing sensitive information)
    - Data modification
    - Potential complete compromise of the database and application.

**Attack vectors:**
-  A crafted HTTP POST request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=side-menu-lite&tab=list` with a malicious payload in the `s` parameter.
-  The specific payload example given is `s=aa%2527+union+select+1%2Cuser%28%29%2C3+--+a`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user with administrative privileges, since the vulnerable page is located at `/wp-admin/`.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the Side Menu Lite plugin before 2.2.6.
- The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited using a `UNION` based SQL injection technique.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')).
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.2 (High).
