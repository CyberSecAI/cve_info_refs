Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-24258:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization and improper handling of user-supplied input within multiple widgets of the ElementsKit and ElementsKit Pro WordPress plugins. Specifically, the plugins fail to adequately filter or escape HTML tags and JavaScript code submitted through various widget parameters, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS, which means malicious scripts injected by attackers are saved in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically when handling parameters related to HTML tags and text content within various widgets.
*   **Improper HTML Tag Handling:** Instead of enforcing a set of safe HTML tags, the plugins allow users to specify arbitrary tags, including the `<script>` tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of any user who views a page containing the malicious widget.
*   **Potential Site Takeover:** If an administrator or editor views a page with malicious code, the attacker can potentially hijack their session and gain administrative access to the WordPress site.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can leverage contributor-level accounts to inject malicious code and potentially gain higher privileges by targeting administrator accounts.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform actions such as data theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Widget Parameters:** The attack vector involves exploiting vulnerable widget parameters by sending a crafted 'save\_builder' request.
*   **Specific Vulnerable Widgets:** Multiple widgets are affected:
    *   "Fun fact" widget: `ekit_funfact_title_size` parameter.
    *   "Heading" widget: `ekit_heading_title_tag` and `ekit_heading_sub_title_tag` parameters combined with `ekit_heading_title` or `ekit_heading_sub_title`
    *   "Icon box" widget: `ekit_icon_box_title_size` parameter.
    *   "Image box" widget: `ekit_image_box_title_size` parameter.
    *   "Pricing" widget: `ekit_pricing_title_size` parameter and `ekit_pricing_table_title`.
    *  "Motion text" (pro version only) widget: `ekit_motion_text_sub_title_tag` parameter.
*   **Modified `save_builder` Request:**  Attackers manipulate the parameters in a 'save\_builder' request to inject malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account with Contributor Role:** The attacker needs at least a contributor-level account to access the Elementor editor and modify page content.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable parameters in the affected widgets to inject the malicious script.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:**  The attacker needs to be able to send modified HTTP requests to inject the malicious payloads through the vulnerable parameters.
