  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The theme does not sanitize the `bt_bb_listing_field_price_range_to`, `bt_bb_listing_field_now_open`, `bt_bb_listing_field_my_lng`, `listing_list_view`, and `bt_bb_listing_field_my_lat` parameters before using them in SQL statements.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint with malicious SQL code in the vulnerable parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site."
