- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly escape the "Button Text" setting when outputting it in the frontend HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users. This could lead to various attacks including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the "Button Text" setting of the plugin's configuration. This setting is then displayed on the frontend of the website, executing the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative access or equivalent privileges to modify the plugin's settings. The attacker needs to access the settings and set the button text to their desired payload.
