## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# YOP Poll < 6.2.8 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

In the plugin, when a poll is created with the options "Allow other answers", "Display other answers in the result list" and "Show results", it can lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues as the 'Other' answer is not sanitised before being output in the page. The execution of the XSS payload depends on the 'Show results' option selected, which could be before or after sending the vote for example.

### Proof of Concept

- Create a new poll that allows other answers, with the results of the other answers being displayed after voting.
- Set the permissions to whoever you'd like to be able to vote.
- Place it on a blog post.
- Insert '<script>alert('xss')</script>' into the Other box.
- Submit a vote. The payload gets triggered when reflected back to users.
- Whenever a new user votes, they will also be affected by the payload.
