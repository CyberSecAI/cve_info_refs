- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The 'Other' answer in a YOP Poll is not sanitized before being output on the page, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the 'Other' answer field before rendering it in the poll results.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users viewing the poll results. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker inserts a malicious script into the 'Other' answer input when submitting a vote on a poll that has the 'Allow other answers', 'Display other answers in the result list', and 'Show results' options enabled. When poll results are displayed to other users, the injected script executes in their browsers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with a poll that is configured to allow "other answers", display those answers, and show results. They need to be able to submit the poll with the crafted payload. No special authentication is needed to vote.
