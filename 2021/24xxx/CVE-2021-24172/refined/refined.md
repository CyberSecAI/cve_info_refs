Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The VM Backups plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CSRF:**  The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions.
    *   **Insecure file storage:** Backup files are created in the uploads directory with timestamped filenames without access restrictions, making them exposed if the path is guessed or directory listing is enabled.
    *   **Use of `mysql_connect()`:** The plugin uses the deprecated `mysql_connect()` function, which requires PHP < 7 to exploit, though it's noted that vulnerable blogs are likely configured this way.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can force a logged-in user to generate backups of the database, plugins, and the current theme.
    *   These backups, if successfully created, are stored in the uploads directory, potentially exposing sensitive data if the directory is accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   The attacker can also send backups to an arbitrary email address.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CSRF Attack:** An attacker crafts a malicious request (e.g., through a link or embedded code on a website) that, when executed by a logged-in user, triggers the backup function within the vulnerable plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to entice or trick a logged-in user to unknowingly execute their malicious request.
    *   The attacker does not need prior access to the WordPress admin panel.
    *   The target server must have PHP < 7 installed to use `mysql_connect()`.
