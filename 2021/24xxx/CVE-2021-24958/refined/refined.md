- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks capability and CSRF checks in the `meks_save_business_selected_account` AJAX action and does not properly sanitize user inputs. This allows any authenticated user to update plugin settings and inject XSS payloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Missing Authorization: Any authenticated user (including subscriber) can access and modify plugin settings.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):  User-supplied data in plugin settings is not sanitized or escaped, leading to stored XSS.
    - Missing CSRF protection: The AJAX endpoint lacks CSRF validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. When an administrator accesses the plugin settings page, the XSS payload is executed in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to perform administrative actions, steal cookies, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network: The attacker sends a POST request to the WordPress `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the vulnerable AJAX action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site (subscriber or higher).
    - The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable AJAX action and the associated parameters.
