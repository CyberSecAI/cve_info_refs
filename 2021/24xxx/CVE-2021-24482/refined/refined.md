The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24482.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input for the `heading_text` and `css` settings, specifically within the WordPress admin panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of sanitization allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users accessing the affected WordPress site, potentially leading to various attacks like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through the WordPress admin panel via crafted HTTP POST requests targeting the `options.php` endpoint to update the plugin settings, specifically the `heading_text` and `css` fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access and modify the plugin settings within the WordPress admin panel.
   - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted server.
