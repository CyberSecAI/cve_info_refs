Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24961:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content from `wpscan.com` directly addresses **CVE-2021-24961** and identifies it as a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability** present in the WordPress File Upload plugin before version 4.16.3.
*   The Trac changeset confirms that the vulnerability is resolved in version 4.16.3.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is **improper sanitization and escaping of shortcode attributes**, leading to potential XSS attacks.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The plugin fails to adequately sanitize user-provided input used as shortcode attributes.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users visiting the affected pages.
*   This could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Malware distribution.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the shortcode attributes.
*   The `wpscan.com` report provides a proof of concept.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to have the ability to use shortcodes with arbitrary attributes. 
*   As mentioned in the `wpscan.com` description, this can be achieved by a user with a role as low as **Contributor** in the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Trac changeset shows that the fix also includes:
    *   Moving `.svg` file types to the blacklist to avoid XSS attacks from scripts within SVG files.
    *   Adding a security check to prevent uploads inside the `wp-content/plugin` directory, which prevents arbitrary code execution via malicious image files.
    *   Improved handling of `videoname` and `imagename` shortcode attributes to avoid directory traversal attacks.
    *   All `wfu_blocks.php` functions are now redeclareable.
*   The fix was included in version 4.16.3 of the plugin.
