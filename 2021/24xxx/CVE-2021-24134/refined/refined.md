- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Button text" and "Field Description" parameters within the Constant Contact Forms plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code can be injected into posts where the malicious form is embedded. This script will then be executed for all users visiting the affected posts, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** A high-privileged user (Editor+) can inject malicious code through the "Add New Form" feature, specifically within the "Button text" and "Field Description" input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Editor-level privileges on the WordPress site to create and modify forms.
