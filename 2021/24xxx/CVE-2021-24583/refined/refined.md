- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper access control when deleting a timeslot. Any user with the `edit_posts` capability (contributor or higher) can delete arbitrary timeslots from any event. Additionally, there is no CSRF check implemented.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Broken Access Control: Improper authorization checks allow unauthorized users to delete timeslots.
    - CSRF: Lack of CSRF protection allows attacks to be performed by tricking an authorized user into submitting a malicious request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can delete arbitrary event timeslots, leading to data loss and disruption of event schedules.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Direct exploitation: An attacker with a contributor or higher role can directly send a crafted POST request to delete timeslots.
    - CSRF: An attacker can create a malicious page or link that forces an authenticated user with `edit_posts` capability to unknowingly delete timeslots when the user clicks or loads the crafted content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -  The attacker needs a WordPress account with a role that has the `edit_posts` capability (contributor or higher).
    - Alternatively, the attacker can trick a logged in user with those permissions into triggering a CSRF attack.
