- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GetPaid plugin versions before 2.3.4 do not properly sanitize the "Label" and "Help Text" input fields when creating a new Payment Form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Contributor role or higher can inject malicious JavaScript code which will be executed when the form is edited or reviewed. This could lead to privilege escalation, potentially allowing the attacker to create rogue admin accounts and take over the site.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with a Contributor role or higher creates a new Payment Form and injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Label" or "Help Text" input fields. The XSS is triggered when the form is edited, such as when an administrator reviews it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role in WordPress. They must be able to create new payment forms.
