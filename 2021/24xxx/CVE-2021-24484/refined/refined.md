- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `get_reports()` function in the plugin does not sanitize or validate the `orderby` parameter before using it in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authenticated Blind SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete database compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The `orderby` parameter within the plugin's admin dashboard is vulnerable. An attacker can manipulate this parameter in a GET or POST request to inject SQL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable functionality within the admin dashboard.
