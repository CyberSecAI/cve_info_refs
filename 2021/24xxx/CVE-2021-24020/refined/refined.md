- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A missing cryptographic step in the implementation of the hash digest algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The hash digest algorithm used is vulnerable to extension attacks because of the missing cryptographic step. This allows tampering with signed URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can bypass signature verification by appending data to the signed URL, leading to improper access control.
- **Attack vectors**: Tampering with signed URLs by appending extra data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication and can be in a network position to intercept and modify signed URLs.
