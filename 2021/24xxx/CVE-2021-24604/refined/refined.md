The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24604.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape Category Names before outputting them in pages/posts where the associated shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** High privilege users can perform XSS attacks by injecting malicious scripts into the Category Name field, which will then execute when a page/post containing the shortcode is viewed. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the Category Name field of the plugin settings. Then, they embed the associated category shortcode in a post/page that users will visit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privilege user access (e.g., administrator) in WordPress to create/edit categories.
