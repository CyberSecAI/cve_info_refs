Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-24281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `delete_action_post` function within the "Redirection for Contact Form 7" plugin lacks proper authorization checks. Specifically, it does not verify user capabilities or implement nonce protection, allowing any authenticated user, even those with minimal privileges (e.g., subscribers), to execute the function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:**  The plugin fails to enforce proper access controls on the `delete_action_post` AJAX action.
- **Missing Authorization:** The function lacks capability checks to ensure only authorized users can delete posts.
- **Lack of Nonce Protection:** The function does not utilize nonces to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** Any authenticated user can delete any post on the WordPress site.
- **Loss of Availability:** Deletion of important posts can negatively impact the site's content and functionality, potentially causing a loss of availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:**  The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **AJAX Action:** The attack is performed by triggering the `wpcf7r_delete_action` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site. Even a user with the lowest privileges (e.g., a subscriber) can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the AJAX action:** The attacker must know the name of the AJAX action (`wpcf7r_delete_action`) to invoke.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to send a crafted POST request to trigger the vulnerable AJAX action.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `delete_action_post` function uses the `wp_trash_post()` function to delete the specified posts. This means that deleted posts are moved to the trash instead of being permanently deleted.
*   The exploit is relatively simple to carry out as demonstrated in the provided Proof of Concept.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.3.4 of the plugin.
