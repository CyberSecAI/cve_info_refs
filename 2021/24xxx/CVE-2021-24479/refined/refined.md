- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or validate some of its settings before outputting them back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected page. This can lead to various malicious actions, including stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing administrative actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious script via the "Checkbox reminder" setting of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the WordPress site.
