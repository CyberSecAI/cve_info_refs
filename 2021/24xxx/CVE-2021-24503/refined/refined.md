- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate shortcode parameters such as "color", "size", or "class".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization/validation of user-supplied input in shortcode parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the website, potentially leading to various malicious activities like session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious payload in the `color`, `size`, or `class` parameters of the `simple_icon` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with Contributor role can inject the XSS payload. Although a post by a contributor needs admin approval to trigger XSS in the frontend, higher privileged users such as Editor can exploit the vulnerability without approval even when the blog disallows `unfiltered_html` capability.
