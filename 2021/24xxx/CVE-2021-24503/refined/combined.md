## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Popular Brand SVG Icons - Simple Icons < 2.7.8 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or validate some of its shortcode parameters, such as "color", "size" or "class", allowing users with a role as low as Contributor to set Cross-Site payload in them. A post made by a contributor would still have to be approved by an admin to have the XSS triggered in the frontend, however, higher privilege users, such as editor could exploit this without the need of approval, and even when the blog disallows the unfiltered\_html capability.

### Proof of Concept

With minimum user interaction (depends on the theme, payload below is for Twenty Twenty-One):
[simple\_icon name="wordpress" color='red;animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition;" onanimationstart="alert(origin);//' size="20px"]
With user interaction, such as a click (all themes):
[simple\_icon name="wordpress" color='red;" onclick="alert(/XSS/);//' size="20px"]

### Affects Plugins
