Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24272:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the "Fitness Calculators" WordPress plugin, combined with insufficient sanitization of user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **CSRF:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF checks, allowing attackers to make logged-in users perform unwanted actions.
2.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Due to the absence of sanitization on user input, specifically when changing calculator headers, attackers can inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed when the page is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker can induce a logged-in user to perform unauthorized actions on the plugin settings, such as changing calculator headers.
-   The injection of malicious scripts can lead to Stored XSS, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, which could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack vector is through a crafted HTML form. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can create a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user, would change the calculator header to inject a script. This form can be delivered through a variety of means, such as an email, chat message, or malicious website.
-   The victim must be logged into their WordPress site and tricked into submitting the attacker's form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML form and persuade a logged-in user to submit it.
-   The attacker does not need prior access to the WordPress site. The attack exploits the lack of CSRF protection and input sanitization.
