- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize the "Cookie Bar Message" setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "Cookie Bar Message" setting, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page where a high privilege user (admin) can inject the malicious payload in the "Cookie Bar Message" field. The XSS is triggered when any user, including unauthenticated users, visits the frontend of the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high-privilege access (Admin+) to modify the plugin settings.
