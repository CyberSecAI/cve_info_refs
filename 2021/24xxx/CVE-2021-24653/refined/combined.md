## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Cookie Bar < 1.8.9 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin doesn't properly sanitise the Cookie Bar Message setting, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Add the following payload in the "Cookie Bar Message" setting of the plugin (/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=cookie-bar-settings): <img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
Then access the frontend (with any user/unauthenticated user) to trigger the XSS

### Affects Plugins
