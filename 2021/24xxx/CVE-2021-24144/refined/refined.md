Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before exporting it to a CSV file. This lack of sanitization allows the injection of malicious formulas into the CSV.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSV Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary formulas into a CSV file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape user input before including it in the CSV export.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By injecting malicious formulas, attackers can potentially execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system when the CSV file is opened in applications like Microsoft Excel, by exploiting features such as DDE.
*   **Data Leakage:** Maliciously crafted hyperlinks can be injected, potentially allowing attackers to leak data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through the plugin's contact form.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to open the crafted CSV file in a vulnerable application for the attack to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to submit a contact form on the affected website and inject malicious formula syntax into form fields.
*   No specific authentication or user privileges are required, making this a low-barrier-to-entry attack.
*   The attacker needs the victim to open the generated CSV file with a vulnerable program (e.g. MS Excel)

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin prior to 1.2.5.6.
*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to inject a malicious formula using a form submission.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CSV Injection, relating to OWASP Top 10 A1: Injection and CWE-1236.
*   The CVSS score is 4.7 (Medium), which reflects the complexity of the attack.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by SunCSR-thiennv.
