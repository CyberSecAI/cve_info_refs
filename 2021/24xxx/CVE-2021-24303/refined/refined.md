Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize or validate the `id` GET parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The plugin directly incorporates the unsanitized `id` parameter into SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin uses `sanitize_text_field()` on the `id` parameter. This function is designed to sanitize text input, not to prevent SQL injection. It does not prevent numeric based SQLi.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries to access and retrieve information they are not authorized to view.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data stored in the database, potentially disrupting the website's functionality.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly detailed, in some cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities could be leveraged to escalate privileges by adding/modifying admin users.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** As demonstrated in the PoC, attackers can inject `SLEEP()` functions, potentially causing delays and impacting the website's performance. A large number of these requests could result in a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via specially crafted GET requests to the WordPress admin panel.
- **`id` Parameter:** The `id` parameter in the URL is used to inject the malicious SQL code.
- **`action` Parameter:** The `action` parameter must be set to `detail` or `delete` in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a logged-in administrator user to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Specific Details:**
- **Vulnerable Plugin:** `jiangqie-official-website-mini-program` versions prior to 1.1.1 are vulnerable.
- **Vulnerable File:** The vulnerability exists in `jiangqie-ow-free-feedback.php` within the plugin's `/includes/` directory.
- **SQL Query:** Specifically, the `get_row()` and `query()` functions are vulnerable because the user-controlled input from the `id` parameter is used directly within the SQL query.
- **Proof of Concept:**
    - The provided PoC demonstrates injecting `SLEEP()` into the SQL query to cause a time delay.
    - Another PoC shows how to delete all records by using `1=1` in the `id` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes a CVSS score of 9.0 (Critical), indicating the severity of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')).
- The vendor has released a fix in version 1.1.1
