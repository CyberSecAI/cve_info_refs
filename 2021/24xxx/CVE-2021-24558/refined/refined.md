Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24558:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `pspin_duplicate_post_save_as_new_post` function within the Project Status WordPress plugin. This function fails to properly sanitize, validate, or escape the `post` GET parameter before outputting it in an error message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Because the `post` parameter isn't sanitized, a malicious script can be injected through the URL, and when the error message is displayed, the script executes in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in user's browser. This can lead to various attacks, including:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing cookies to gain unauthorized access to the user's account.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive data from the WordPress dashboard.
    - **Malicious actions:** Performing unwanted actions on behalf of the user, such as creating, modifying, or deleting content.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting the user to a malicious website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing the malicious script in the `post` parameter.
- This URL needs to be accessed by a logged-in user to trigger the XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the script in the `post` parameter.
- An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to click the link. An attacker does not need to have any privileges on the site
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to duplicate a post that doesn't exist.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `includes/clone/duplicate-post-admin.php` at line 187:
    ```php
    wp_die(esc_attr(__('Copy creation failed, could not find original:', pspin_duplicate_post_I18N_DOMAIN)) . ' ' . $id);
    ```
- The `esc_attr()` function was not applied to the `$id` variable which contained the unsanitized `post` parameter value, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.
- The provided PoC URL clearly shows the use of `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` to demonstrate the XSS.
- The vulnerability affects Project Status plugin versions up to and including 1.6.
- The plugin was closed.
