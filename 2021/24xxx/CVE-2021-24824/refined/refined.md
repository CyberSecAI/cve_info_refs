Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `[field]` shortcode in the Custom Content Shortcode plugin allows authenticated users, even those with low-level roles like "contributor," to access arbitrary post metadata. This is due to a lack of proper authorization checks within the shortcode's functionality.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Incorrect Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested metadata.
    *   **Arbitrary Metadata Access:** The `[field]` shortcode does not limit the type of post metadata that can be accessed and allows retrieval of any data associated with a specific post ID.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *  **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information such as order details, customer email addresses, or other private data stored as post metadata. The example provided uses WooCommerce, which highlights how order information is exposed
    *  **Information Leakage**: Malicious actors could gather information they would normally be unable to access

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Shortcode Usage:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by using the `[field]` shortcode within a post's content.
    *   **Post ID Parameter:** The shortcode takes an `id` parameter, allowing the attacker to specify which post's metadata to retrieve.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a role as low as "contributor" on the WordPress site.
    *   **Knowledge of Shortcode Syntax:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `[field]` shortcode and its parameters.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Custom Content Shortcode plugin versions prior to 4.0.1.
*   The vulnerability is classified under "Broken Access Control" (OWASP Top 10) and CWE-863.
* The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.5 (Medium).
* A PoC is included, showing how order email information can be accessed using the shortcode and a post id when WooCommerce is also installed.
