```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks capability and CSRF checks in the `dpwap_plugin_activate` AJAX action.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing access control and CSRF protection, allowing unauthorized plugin activation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Any authenticated user, including subscribers, can activate plugins that are already installed on the WordPress site.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends an AJAX POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `dpwap_plugin_activate` and the `dpwap_url` parameter set to the plugin file path. A nonce was added in v<1.6.0 but it's still exploitable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a logged-in user on the WordPress site. No specific user role is needed; even a subscriber can exploit this vulnerability."
