- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape the `class` attribute within its shortcode before outputting it back into the HTML attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website which will be executed in the browsers of users who visit the affected pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious shortcode with a `class` attribute containing XSS payload, an attacker can inject javascript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. They need to be able to create or edit content where shortcodes can be used.
