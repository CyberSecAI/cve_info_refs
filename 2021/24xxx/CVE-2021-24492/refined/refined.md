Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization, validation, or escaping of the `hndtst_previewShortcodeInstanceId` POST parameter within the `hndtst_action_instance_callback` AJAX call. This parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper input handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLI) due to the unsafe use of user-supplied data in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to:
   - Extract sensitive information.
   - Modify or delete data.
   - Potentially gain further access to the server.
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **AJAX Call:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted AJAX request to the `hndtst_action_instance_callback` endpoint.
- **POST Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `hndtst_previewShortcodeInstanceId` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least the subscriber role.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `tst_shortcode_generator.php`, specifically around line 451:
    ```php
    $hndtst_previewShortcodeInstanceId = ( $_POST['hndtst_previewShortcodeInstanceId'] );
    $table = $wpdb->prefix . 'hndtst_saved';
    $row = $wpdb->get_row(
    	"
    	SELECT id,name,shortcode,options
    	FROM $table
    	WHERE id = " . $hndtst_previewShortcodeInstanceId
    );
    ```
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject SQL code using the `hndtst_previewShortcodeInstanceId` parameter.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.1 of the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
* The CVSS score is 9.9 (critical)
* The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')).
* The researcher who identified the vulnerability is Shreya Pohekar from Codevigilant Project.
