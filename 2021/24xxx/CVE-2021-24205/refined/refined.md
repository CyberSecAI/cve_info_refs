  "CVE-2021-24205": {
    "Description": "Multiple Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were discovered in the Elementor plugin for WordPress. The vulnerabilities allowed any user with access to the Elementor editor, including contributors, to inject malicious JavaScript into posts/pages. This JavaScript would be executed when the post/page is viewed, edited or previewed by any other user, including administrators, potentially leading to site takeover.",
    "Root cause": "The plugin did not properly validate HTML tags used in various elements such as 'Heading', 'Column', 'Accordion', 'Icon Box', 'Image Box', and 'Divider'. Specifically, the 'html_tag' and 'header_size' parameters were not sanitized on the server-side, allowing users to inject arbitrary JavaScript within these parameters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Lack of server-side sanitization of user-controlled HTML tags",
       "Output of unsanitized user input leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of any user accessing the affected post/page. This could be used to perform administrative actions, create new malicious admin accounts, inject backdoors, and ultimately take over the affected website.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The attacker must have access to the Elementor editor, which can include users with 'contributor' level permissions or above.",
      "Malicious JavaScript is injected into specific element parameters, such as 'html_tag' or 'header_size' via a crafted request.",
       "The injected JavaScript is executed when another user (including administrator) views, edits or previews the affected post/page."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have at least 'contributor' level access to the WordPress site to be able to access the Elementor editor. They also need the ability to craft requests to modify element parameters. No user interaction is required for the malicious code to execute as it is triggered upon viewing/editing/previewing the post.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was present because HTML tags within certain elements were not validated server-side, allowing users to set parameters like `html_tag` to `<script>` or other HTML attributes that trigger JavaScript execution. While some elements escaped output, this was not sufficient to prevent exploitation as demonstrated with 'Heading' and 'Divider' elements where output was nested immediately inside the unsanitized HTML tags. Patches in version 3.1.4 enforce a list of allowed HTML tags on the server side."
