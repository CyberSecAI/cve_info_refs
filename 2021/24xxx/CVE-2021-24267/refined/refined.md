Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24267:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of server-side enforcement of HTML tag options in several widgets of the "All-in-One Addons for Elementor – WidgetKit" plugin.
*   The plugin allows users to select HTML tags for formatting text within widgets.
*   The plugin fails to sanitize or validate user-provided input when adding tags via parameters, such as 'custom\_header\_tag', 'post\_header\_tag', or 'heading_tag'.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code injected through the vulnerable parameters gets stored in the database and executed when the affected page is viewed, edited, or previewed by any user.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate the HTML tag options provided by users through parameters. It allows arbitrary HTML tags, including `<script>` tags, to be injected.
*   **Insecure Output Handling:** The plugin outputs the stored tag values directly without encoding or sanitizing, leading to the execution of injected JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Site Takeover:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that could potentially be used to take over a site if an administrator is affected.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A lower-privileged user (e.g., contributor) can inject malicious JavaScript into a post, which then executes in the browser of a higher-privileged user (e.g., administrator) who previews the post.
*   **Malicious Activity:** Attackers can perform arbitrary actions such as redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, or modifying site content using the injected JavaScript.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Request Manipulation:** An attacker can intercept a request when adding or editing an element in the Elementor editor and modify the HTML tag parameter to include a `<script>` tag with malicious JavaScript.
*   **Direct Parameter Injection:** An attacker can directly provide malicious JavaScript within parameters such as ‘custom_header_tag’ or ‘heading_tag’ through the WordPress interface when creating or editing content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor level permissions. This level allows the attacker to access the Elementor editor and create/edit content.
*  **Network access**: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable website.
* **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker requires a basic understanding of how to craft malicious HTML/JavaScript and how HTTP requests function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple widgets of the plugin, including Content Carousel, testimonial, slider-1, slider-2, slider-3 and team.
*   The vulnerability is similar to those found in the main Elementor plugin and other Elementor addon plugins.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.3.10 of the "All-in-One Addons for Elementor - WidgetKit" plugin.
* The CVSS score for the vulnerability is 6.8 (Medium)
* The vulnerability was reported by Ramuel Gall.

This vulnerability allows a contributor to inject arbitrary javascript into a page, which can escalate into a site takeover if an admin views the page.
