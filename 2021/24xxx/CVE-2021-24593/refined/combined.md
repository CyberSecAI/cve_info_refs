## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Business Hours Indicator < 2.3.5 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or escape its 'Now closed message" setting when outputting it in the backend and frontend, leading to an Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "Now closed message" setting and save them: <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
Then refresh the setting page, or go to a page where the Business Hours are output (tested with the [mbhi ..] shortcode) to trigger the XSS
