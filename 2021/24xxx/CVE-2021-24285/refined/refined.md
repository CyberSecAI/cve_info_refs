Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24285

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress plugin "Car Seller - Auto Classifieds Script" version <= 2.1.0

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization, validation, or escaping of the `order_id` POST parameter within the `request_list_request` AJAX call. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The plugin directly uses user-supplied input (`order_id`) in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive database information (e.g. user credentials, private data).
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Attackers could modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Complete system compromise:** In severe cases, SQL Injection may allow for Remote Code Execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The `request_list_request` AJAX call is accessible to both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=request_list_request` and a malicious `order_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target WordPress site.
*   No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using `curl`.
* The vulnerability is classified as critical with a CVSS score of 9.9.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Shreya Pohekar of Codevigilant Project.
*   No known fix for the vulnerability is mentioned in the provided content.
