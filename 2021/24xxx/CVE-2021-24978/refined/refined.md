Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The OSMapper plugin (versions <= 2.1.5) registers an AJAX action (`ba_map_ajax_handler`) with the `wp_ajax_nopriv` prefix. This makes the action available to unauthenticated users.
*   The AJAX handler for deleting map posts does not include any authorization checks, CSRF protection, or validation to ensure the post being deleted is actually a 'map' post.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of authorization checks in the AJAX handler, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger the deletion of posts.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:**  The absence of CSRF protection allows attackers to perform the action without a valid nonce.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The code doesn't check if the post being deleted is actually of the 'map' post type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** An unauthenticated attacker can delete any post on the WordPress site, regardless of its type. This could lead to significant data loss and disruption of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint. No user authentication or prior knowledge of the system is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special capabilities needed**: The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
*   **No position requirements**:  An attacker can be located anywhere on the internet and does not need any access to the WordPress system.

**Technical Details**

*   The AJAX action is triggered via a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`
*   The required parameters in the POST request are:
    *   `action=ba_map_ajax_handler`
    *   `requestType=delete_map`
    *   `requestParams=<post ID>`
*   The `post ID` can be any valid post ID on the system.
