Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24444

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The TaxoPress plugin fails to properly sanitize the Taxonomy description field. This allows high-privilege users to inject JavaScript payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied data.
- The plugin permits the use of JavaScript within the taxonomy description field, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Taxonomy description, which will be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the taxonomy table.
- This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of other users.
- It could lead to session hijacking or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when viewing a taxonomy table which displays the unsanitized taxonomy description containing the malicious JavaScript code.
- Attackers inject the malicious JavaScript code by adding or editing a taxonomy description through the WordPress admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a high-privilege account on the affected WordPress site.
- Specifically, the attacker needs the ability to edit or create taxonomies.
