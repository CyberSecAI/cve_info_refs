Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24856:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Shared Files" does not properly sanitize and escape the "Download Counter Text" setting. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into this setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Download Counter Text". When a page or post that uses the Shared Files widget is loaded, this code will execute in the context of the user's browser.
- The impact could range from redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, and performing actions on the user's behalf to potentially defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to access the WordPress admin panel to modify the "Download Counter Text" setting under "Shared Files". This is a high privilege setting.
- The malicious code is then triggered when a user visits a page containing the [shared_files] shortcode where the download counter text is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires administrative privileges (or a user role with sufficient access) to modify the plugin settings.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the plugin settings page.
