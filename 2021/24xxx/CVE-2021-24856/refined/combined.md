## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Shared Files < 1.6.61 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the Download Counter Text settings, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the Download Counter Text settings (and tick the Show Download Counter as well): <svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered in pages/posts where the [shared\_files] is embed and has at least one file
