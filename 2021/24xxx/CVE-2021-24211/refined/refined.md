- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Related Posts Title" field on the settings page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of any user who views a page where the related posts are displayed after an admin user has saved the malicious payload in the plugin's settings. This can lead to account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject the malicious payload via the plugin's settings page. The XSS is triggered when a user views a page where the related posts are displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have administrator or higher privileges on the WordPress site to be able to modify plugin settings and inject the malicious payload.
