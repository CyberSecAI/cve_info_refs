## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Video Lessons Manager - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugins do not properly sanitize and escape values when updating their settings, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

\* Open the CM Video Lesson Plugin's Settings page.
\* Click on Label Tab
\* Enter payload like [ "><script>alert(1)</script> [ into the "channel" or "channels" fields.
\* Save and the payload will execute on future visits to the Settings page.
