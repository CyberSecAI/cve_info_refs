The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24713.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied values when updating settings. Specifically, input fields within the 'Label' tab of the plugin's settings are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows high-privilege users to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users visiting the plugin settings page. This can lead to account compromise, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker with high privileges (e.g., administrator) can inject the XSS payload via the plugin's settings page. Specifically, the "channel" or "channels" fields under the Label tab are vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) in the WordPress instance.
