- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings before outputting them in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected pages. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to have administrator privileges to modify the plugin settings, including the "Folder for new files" and "Maximum size of uploaded file" settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Administrator-level access to the WordPress instance is required to modify the plugin settings and inject the malicious payload.
