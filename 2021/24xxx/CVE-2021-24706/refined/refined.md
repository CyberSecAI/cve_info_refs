- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the `Qwizcards-content HTML` field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be an administrator or higher privileged user. They can inject the malicious payload through the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Admin or higher privileges within the WordPress site.
