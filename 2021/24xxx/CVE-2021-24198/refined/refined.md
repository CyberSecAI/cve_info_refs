Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24198:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content directly addresses **CVE-2021-24198** and provides detailed information about the vulnerability, which aligns with the official description stating "Improper Access Control leading to Table Data Deletion".

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is **Improper Access Control**. The plugin fails to properly restrict access to data modification functions based on user permissions.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Broken Access Control:** The plugin allows authenticated users to manipulate HTTP parameters (`id_key` and `id_val`) to delete data belonging to other users within the same table, even when they are not authorized to do so.
   - The vulnerability exists in the `wdt_delete_table_row` action within the wp-admin/admin-ajax.php endpoint.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Data Deletion:** An attacker can delete arbitrary data from tables, potentially causing data loss.
   - **Denial of Service:** Mass deletion of data could disrupt the application's functionality.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `id_key` and `id_val` parameters in an HTTP POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
   - The attacker changes `id_key` to the column name that stores the user ID and `id_val` to the user ID of the data that needs to be deleted.
   - The attacker must be a logged in user.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the WordPress site.
   - **Access to table:** The attacker needs to have access to the page where the vulnerable table is published with front-end editing enabled and limiting editing to own data only..
   - **HTTP Interception Tool:** The attacker uses a tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable endpoint is `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- The vulnerable parameters are `id_key` and `id_val`.
- The vulnerable action is `wdt_delete_table_row`.
- The plugin does not check if the user deleting the data is authorized to do so, leading to the broken access control.
- The `id_key` parameter can be any string column name.
- The `id_val` parameter supports only integers or floats.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.4.2 of the wpDataTables plugin.
- The vulnerability affects the premium version of the plugin.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Veno Eivazian and Massimiliano Ferraresi.
