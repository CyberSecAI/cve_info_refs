{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `get_faqs()` function in the plugin did not sanitize or validate the `orderby` parameter before using it in SQL statements, leading to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input used in SQL queries.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform database queries leading to information disclosure, modification or deletion. The proof of concept shows how an attacker can use SQL injection to extract data from the database.",
   "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `orderby` parameter in the HTTP GET request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php` page of the WordPress admin dashboard for the vulnerable plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator privileges to access the affected page."
