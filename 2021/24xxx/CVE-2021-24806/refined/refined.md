The provided content relates to CVE-2021-24806.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The wpDiscuz WordPress plugin versions before 7.3.4 does not properly check for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) when adding, editing, and deleting comments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing CSRF protection when adding, editing and deleting comments
- Missing CSRF protection for other actions like wpdCloseThread (to close/open threads) and wpdStickComment (to stick/unstick a comment)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can force a logged-in user to add arbitrary comments.
- An attacker can force a logged-in user, including an admin, to edit or delete arbitrary comments.
- An attacker can force a logged-in user to close/open threads or stick/unstick comments.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that makes a request to the vulnerable plugin endpoint.
- The attacker social engineers the logged-in user to open this malicious HTML page. The user's browser will then automatically send a request including the user's session cookie to the server executing the malicious action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page that will automatically perform the actions.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the WordPress admin panel.
