- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs within wp-admin pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings which will then be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the wp-admin pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with sufficient access to the plugin's settings within the WordPress admin panel can inject the XSS payload into the "Whats your reaction" field located in the plugin's "StylingTab" configuration page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress plugin settings to modify the plugin's configuration.
