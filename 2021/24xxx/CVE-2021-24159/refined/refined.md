Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Contact Form 7 Style plugin lacks both sanitization of user-supplied CSS and nonce protection on the custom CSS feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin does not properly protect against CSRF attacks. An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated administrator, modifies the plugin's settings.
*  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization on user-provided CSS input allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript. This JavaScript will be stored and executed within the context of the affected site when an administrator views the relevant page/section.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the site via the plugin's custom CSS settings, allowing for arbitrary actions, such as defacement, data theft, or further compromise of the site and its users.
*  The injected JavaScript is stored on the site, which means the malicious script is executed each time an administrator views the area where the injected CSS is being used.
*  Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the website due to the high privileges associated with administrative accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is initiated by crafting a malicious request that modifies the custom CSS settings of the plugin.
*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into clicking a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment, which sends the crafted request to the vulnerable website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request.
*   The attacker needs to trick an administrator user with active session on the vulnerable WordPress site to trigger the malicious request.
*   No specific access to the WordPress instance is required beforehand.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerable plugin is "Contact Form 7 Style" versions 3.1.9 and below, not the Contact Form 7 plugin itself.
* The plugin was removed from the WordPress repository due to the lack of response from the developer.
* Wordfence users are protected by the Web Application Firewall's built-in XSS protection, but it's highly recommended to remove the plugin.
* The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 8.8.
* The plugin has been updated to version 3.2 however, it is still not available for download due to the plugin being closed for review.

**CVE Information:**
