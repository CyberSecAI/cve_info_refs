- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper verification of the user certificate's chain of trust in FortiGate SSL-VPN. Specifically, the system does not correctly follow the chain of trust of the certificate, leading to the bypass of proper authentication checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper certificate chain of trust validation. The vulnerability lies in the SSL-VPN component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication checks and connect to the SSL-VPN using any certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the network. This results in Information Disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based; an attacker needs to initiate an SSL-VPN connection to a vulnerable FortiGate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a valid user account and a certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (but not necessarily linked to the specific user), and the ability to connect to the FortiGate SSL-VPN service. The attacker does not need a privileged position on the network or any prior access to the Fortigate system other than the ability to connect to its VPN service.
