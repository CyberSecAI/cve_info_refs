Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24282:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper access controls on several AJAX actions within the "Redirection for Contact Form 7" WordPress plugin. These AJAX actions lacked both capability checks and nonce verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unprotected AJAX actions:** Several AJAX actions within the plugin were accessible to any authenticated user, including those with minimal privileges like subscribers.
*   **Missing capability checks:** The plugin did not verify if the user had the necessary permissions to perform actions triggered by the AJAX endpoints.
*  **Missing nonce verification:** The plugin did not properly use nonces to protect AJAX actions from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized modification of plugin settings:** Attackers could reset the pluginâ€™s settings, add or delete actions associated with forms.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** The ability to add actions to the plugin could potentially be combined with other vulnerabilities, like the arbitrary post deletion issue (CVE-2021-24281), to cause more damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attackers could send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints.
*   **Authenticated users:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site (even a low-privilege user like a subscriber) to exploit this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have an account on the target WordPress site.
*   The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided content from Wordfence gives a more detailed breakdown of the vulnerability than what is provided in the WPScan content. 
* The Wordfence content also mentions other vulnerabilities in the plugin fixed in the same update, including: unauthenticated arbitrary nonce generation (CVE-2021-24278), authenticated arbitrary plugin installation (CVE-2021-24279), authenticated PHP object injection (CVE-2021-24280) and authenticated arbitrary post deletion (CVE-2021-24281).
