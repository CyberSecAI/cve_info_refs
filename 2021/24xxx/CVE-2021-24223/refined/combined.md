## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# N5 Upload Form <= 1.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload to RCE

### Description

The plugin suffers from an arbitrary file upload issue in page where a Form from the plugin is embed, as any file can be uploaded. The uploaded filename might be hard to guess as it's generated with md5(uniqid(rand())), however, in the case of misconfigured servers with Directory listing enabled, accessing it is trivial.

### Proof of Concept

The PoC will be displayed once the issue has been remediated.

# N5 Upload Form <= 1.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload

An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in N5 Upload Form in current version 1.0 allows the remote attackers to upload
arbitrary executable files and achieve the remote code execution. The plugin provides a file uploading form to the plugin user
and allows the user to decide which directory is used for the uploading files in the local operating system.
But it does not ensure that the directory cannot be accessed by the remote attacker, and the extension of the file is also
unrestricted.

[Proof of Video](https://youtu.be/atrGpU7I8F8)

In order to provide the file uploading functionality, It uses move\_uploaded\_file() function to store the file to the directory
that decided by the plugin user. However, it only checks whether the directory is existing or not and failed to check file extension
before use the move\_uploaded\_file() function.

```
<?php
if ($post_meta['usernotice'] == 0 && !file_exists($post_meta['directory'])) {
    $upload_errors[] = __('The uploading failed.', 'N5_UPLOADFORM');
}

if (count($upload_errors) == 0) {
    $file['uploadedname'] = sprintf("%s.%s", md5(uniqid(rand())), $file['ext']);
    move_uploaded_file($file['obj']['tmp_name'], sprintf("%s/%s", $post_meta['directory'], $file['uploadedname']));
}
...

```
