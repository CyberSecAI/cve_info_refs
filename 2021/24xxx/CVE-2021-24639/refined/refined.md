- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not enforce path validation, authorization, and CSRF checks in the `omgf_ajax_empty_dir` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of path validation: Allows arbitrary file and folder deletion by providing manipulated paths.
    - Insufficient authorization: Allows authenticated users with low privileges (e.g., subscriber role) to trigger the deletion.
    - Missing CSRF protection: The AJAX action is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files and folders on the server. This could lead to complete destruction of the WordPress installation.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user (even with low privileges like "subscriber") can trigger the vulnerable AJAX action via a crafted POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site. They can have the lowest level role i.e subscriber to exploit this.
