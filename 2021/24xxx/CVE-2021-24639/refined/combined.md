## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# OMGF < 4.5.4 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary File/Folder Deletion

### Description

The plugin does not enforce path validation, authorisation and CSRF checks in the omgf\_ajax\_empty\_dir AJAX action, which allows any authenticated users to delete arbitrary files or folders on the server.

### Proof of Concept

As an authenticated user, with a role as low as subscriber, viewing the admin the dashboard (/wp-admin/index.php), run the below command in the Web Developer console of the web browser. This will delete /wp-content/index.php file ("silence is golden"). You can also do /../../../\*\* or /../../../wp-admin/ or... (assuming you want to destroy the installation).
jQuery.post(ajaxurl,{action:"omgf\_ajax\_empty\_dir",section:"/../../index.php"})
