- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin failed to properly verify uploaded feed images, specifically those in the "Podcast Artwork" section. This allowed high-privilege users (administrators and higher) to upload arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient file validation leading to arbitrary file upload.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE) through the upload of malicious PHP files.
- **Attack vectors:** Authenticated users with administrative or higher privileges can upload malicious files disguised as images via the "Podcast Artwork" upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have administrator or higher level access to the WordPress site. They also need to be able to create a crafted HTTP POST request.
