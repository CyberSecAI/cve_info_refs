Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with **CVE-2021-24161**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The plugin's theme import functionality, present in versions prior to 4.0.0, lacked nonce checks. This allowed attackers to forge requests to the theme import function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is a CSRF flaw in the theme import functionality. This flaw allows an attacker to trick an administrator into submitting a malicious request.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker could upload a malicious zip file, containing PHP files, to the server through the theme import function.
- **Lack of Nonce Check**: The absence of nonce verification meant that requests could be forged without the user's knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation would allow the attacker to upload a zip file containing malicious PHP files. These files would be extracted to a publicly accessible directory. Accessing the uploaded files would execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Site Takeover:** Ultimately, this could lead to complete site compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based, requiring the attacker to craft and send a malicious request to the target site.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into initiating the request, usually by visiting a malicious web page or link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target WordPress site to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
- **Administrator victim:** The attacker needs to trick an administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a page crafted to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Web access:** The attacker must have the ability to serve a webpage or send a request to the target server.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affected versions of the plugin prior to 4.0.0, or those running in legacy mode in 4.0.0-4.0.3.
- The vulnerable functionality is related to importing themes.
- The fix for this vulnerability was released in version 4.0.4.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (High).
- The vulnerability could be used to achieve remote code execution on vulnerable sites.
