{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 'Image Hover Effects' widget in the 'Image Hover Effects - Elementor Addon' plugin allows users to select an HTML tag for formatting text. The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the selected tag, allowing users to inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Inadequate input sanitization/validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with contributor-level access to a WordPress site can inject malicious JavaScript code into a post or page using the vulnerable widget. When other users, including administrators, view or preview the page, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browser, which could lead to site takeover.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a vulnerable widget within the Image Hover Effects - Elementor Addon plugin. An attacker crafts a malicious payload by modifying the 'eihe_tag' parameter of the widget to include JavaScript. This can be done by directly setting the tag to script or setting it to a remotely sourced script.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have at least a 'contributor' role or higher on the WordPress site to be able to use the Elementor editor and add content. No other special capabilities are required."
