- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `test` parameter of the `xmlfeed` option in the plugin is not sanitized, escaped, or validated before being inserted into a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete control over the database.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted HTTP request targeting the vulnerable parameter `test` in the `xmlfeed` option via the WordPress admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator to exploit the vulnerability.
