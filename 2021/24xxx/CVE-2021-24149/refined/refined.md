- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin failed to sanitize the `mec[post_id]` POST parameter within the `mec_fes_form` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a malicious `mec[post_id]` parameter and the action set to `mec_fes_form`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in with author or higher level privileges. If the Frontend Event Submission form is publicly available, even subscriber-level users could perform the SQL Injection.
