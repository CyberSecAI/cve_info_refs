Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24594:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of certain plugin settings before outputting them on various pages. Specifically, the `googlelanguagetranslator_floating_widget_text` setting was not sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved in the database and executed when the affected setting is rendered in the admin panel or the front-end of the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code. This can lead to various malicious activities like:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing user session cookies and credentials.
    *   Modifying the content of the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Admin Panel Input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious script into the "Custom text for the floating widget" setting found within the plugin's settings page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privilege User:** The attacker needs to have administrative or high-privilege access to the WordPress admin panel to modify plugin settings. The vulnerability can be exploited by users with at least the 'edit_posts' capability, or a similar permission that allows them to edit the plugin's settings.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable setting is `googlelanguagetranslator_floating_widget_text`.
*   The fix implemented in changeset [2607480](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2607480/) involves applying the `wp_kses_post` sanitization function to the `googlelanguagetranslator_floating_widget_text` setting.
*   Prior to the fix, this setting was not being sanitized which allowed arbitrary HTML and JavaScript to be stored in the database.
