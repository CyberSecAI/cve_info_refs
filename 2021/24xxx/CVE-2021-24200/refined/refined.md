Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24200:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content includes a detailed write-up from n4nj0.github.io that specifically discusses CVE-2021-24200. This confirms the relevance of the content to the CVE.
   - The content describes a SQL injection vulnerability related to the 'length' parameter in wpDataTables, which aligns with the CVE description.
   - Additionally, the content from wpscan.com also references CVE-2021-24200 and confirms that it's related to a Blind SQL Injection in the 'length' parameter of the wpDataTables plugin.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   *   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `length` parameter when constructing SQL queries used by the wpDataTables plugin. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The plugin fails to sanitize the `length` parameter allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code. This is a Blind SQL Injection, meaning the attacker does not see the direct results of the injected query, but can infer information based on the response time or other behaviors of the application.

    *   **Impact of Exploitation:**
        *   **Data Breach:** An attacker could extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials.
        *   **Account Takeover:** By obtaining user credentials, an attacker can gain administrative access to the WordPress site.
        *   **Remote Code Execution:** With administrative access, an attacker can install or modify plugins and themes, leading to remote code execution and full compromise of the server.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=get_wdtable` and a manipulated `length` parameter in the request body.

    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *   The attacker needs to have an authenticated account on the WordPress site (with minimal privileges).
        *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and intercept responses (typically using tools like Burp Suite).

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions:**

   *   The n4nj0.github.io content provides a step-by-step guide to reproduce the SQL Injection vulnerability, using SQLMap.
   *   The vulnerable endpoint and parameter are clearly identified as:
        *   **URL:** `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_wdtable&table_id=1`
        *   **HTTP Parameter:** `length`
   *   The content details the usage of `SQLMap` to extract the database banner and dump user data.
   *   The SQL injection is specifically described as "Boolean-based blind SQL Injection".

**4. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Veno Eivazian and Massimiliano Ferraresi.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in wpDataTables version 3.4.2.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is classified as "Medium" with a CVSS score of 6.5 according to NVD. However, wpscan.com rates it as 9.9 (critical), showing the potential impact it has.
*   The detailed changelog from wpdatatables.com confirms that the fix is included in version 3.4.2.
*   The provided content includes a full HTTP POST request example and SQLMap commands for exploitation.

**In summary:**
The provided content confirms the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-24200) in the `length` parameter of the wpDataTables plugin. It details the attack vector, the root cause, and the potential impacts of exploitation. The information is thorough and consistent with the official CVE description and supporting resources.
