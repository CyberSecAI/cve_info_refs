- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection and does not validate if the post to be deleted belongs to the plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability leading to arbitrary post deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can allow an attacker to force a logged-in administrator to delete arbitrary posts from the blog.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection and targets the post deletion functionality of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised webpage that triggers the crafted request.
