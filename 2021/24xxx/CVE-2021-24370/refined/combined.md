# Critical 0-day in Fancy Product Designer Under Active Attack

*Update: A patched version of Fancy Product Designer, 4.6.9, is now available as of June 2, 2021. This article has been updated to reflect newly available information, including Indicators of Compromise.*

On May 31, 2021, the Wordfence Threat Intelligence team discovered a critical file upload vulnerability being actively exploited in Fancy Product Designer, a WordPress plugin installed on over 17,000 sites.

We initiated contact with the plugin’s developer the same day and received a response within 24 hours. We sent over the full disclosure the same day we received a response, on June 1, 2021. Due to this vulnerability being actively attacked, we are publicly disclosing with minimal details until users have time to update to the patched version in order to alert the community to take precautions to keep their sites protected.

While the Wordfence Firewall’s built-in file upload protection sufficiently blocks the majority of attacks against this vulnerability, we determined that a bypass was possible in some configurations. As such, we released a new firewall rule to our premium customers on May 31, 2021. Sites still running the free version of Wordfence will receive the rule after 30 days, on June 30, 2021.

As this is a Critical 0-day under active attack and is exploitable in some configurations even if the plugin has been deactivated, we urge anyone using this plugin to update to the latest version available, 4.6.9, immediately.

**Description:** Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload and Remote Code Execution

**Affected Plugin:** Fancy Product Designer

**Plugin Slug:** [fancy-product-designer](https://codecanyon.net/item/fancy-product-designer-woocommercewordpress/6318393)

**Affected Versions:** < 4.6.9

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24370

**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Researcher/s:** Charles Sweethill/Ram Gall

**Fully Patched Version:** 4.6.9

Fancy Product Designer is a WordPress plugin that offers the ability for customers to upload images and PDF files to be added to products. Unfortunately, while the plugin had some checks in place to prevent malicious files from being uploaded, these checks were insufficient and could easily be bypassed, allowing attackers to upload executable PHP files to any site with the plugin installed. This effectively made it possible for any attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution on an impacted site, allowing full site takeover.

We will provide a more detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability once more users have updated to a patched version.

## How do I update?

In most cases you will need to login to codecanyon.net. Once you are logged in, you should be able to visit the product page at <https://codecanyon.net/item/fancy-product-designer-woocommercewordpress/6318393>. In the Overview sidebar on the right-hand side of the product page you should see a Download link:

![Download link for fancy product designer](https://www.wordfence.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Fancy-Product-Designer-WooCommerce-WordPress-by-radykal-CodeCanyon-2021-06-02-09-54-57.png)

Once you have downloaded the patched version of the plugin, you should be able to login to your WordPress site and go to Plugins->Add New->Upload Plugin to upload the patched plugin.

## Indicators of Compromise

In most cases a successful attack results in a number of files which will appear in a subfolder of either

`wp-admin`

or

`wp-content/plugins/fancy-product-designer/inc`

with the date the file was uploaded. For instance:

`wp-content/plugins/fancy-product-designer/inc/2021/05/30/4fa00001c720b30102987d980e62d5e4.php`

or

`wp-admin/2021/05/31/4fa00001c720b30102987d980e62d5e4.php`

*Update – the filenames in question are deterministic and we have added filenames associated with this vulnerability.*

The following filenames and MD5 hashes are associated with this attack:

`ass.php` – MD5 `3783701c82396cc96d842839a291e813`. This is the initial payload, a dropper that then retrieves additional malware from a 3rd party site.

`op.php` – MD5 `29da9e97d5efe5c9a8680c7066bb2840`. A password-protected Webshell.

`prosettings.php` – MD5 `e6b9197ecdc61125a4e502a5af7cecae`. A Webshell found in older infections.

`4fa00001c720b30102987d980e62d5e4.php` – MD5 `4329689c76ccddd1d2f4ee7fef3dab71`. This payload decodes and loads a separate Webshell.

`4fa00001c720b30002987d983e62d5e1.jpg` – MD5 `c8757b55fc7d456a7a1a1aa024398471`. The compressed webshell loaded by `4fa00001c720b30102987d980e62d5e4.php`. Cannot be executed without the loader script.

The majority of attacks against this vulnerability are coming from the following IP addresses:

`69.12.71.82`

`92.53.124.123`

`46.53.253.152`

This attacker appears to be targeting e-commerce sites and attempting to extract order information from site databases. As this order information contains personally identifiable information from customers, site owners are in a particularly difficult position if they are still running vulnerable versions of this plugin as it risks the e-commerce merchant’s PCI-DSS compliance.

Our research indicates that this vulnerability is likely not being attacked on a large scale but has been exploited since at least May 16, 2021. *Update: Our Threat Intelligence Team has now found evidence of this vulnerability being exploited as early as January 30, 2021.*

## Timeline

**May 31, 2021** 15:05 UTC – Wordfence Security Analyst Charles Sweethill finds evidence of a previously unknown vulnerability during malware removal and forensic investigation as part of a [site cleaning](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-site-cleanings/?promo_id=blog20210601&promo_name=get-site-clean&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=conclusion) and begins investigating possible attack vectors.

**May 31, 2021** 18:59 UTC – We release the firewall rule protecting against this vulnerability to Wordfence Premium customers.

**June 1, 2021** 09:03 UTC – The plugin developer responds to our initial contact.

**June 1, 2021** 13:35 UTC – We send over full disclosure.

**June 2, 2021** – The plugin developer releases a patched version, 4.6.9, of the plugin.

**June 30, 2021** – Firewall rule becomes available to free Wordfence users.

## Conclusion

In today’s article, we covered a critical 0-day vulnerability in Fancy Product Designer that is being actively attacked and used to upload malware onto sites that have the plugin installed.

While [Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/?promo_id=blog20210601&promo_name=get-premium&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=conclusion) users should be protected against this vulnerability, we urge any users of this plugin to update to the latest version of the plugin, 4.6.9, immediately, as it is possible in some configurations to exploit the vulnerability even if the plugin is deactivated.

We will continue to monitor the situation and follow up as more information becomes available.

*Special Thanks to Wordfence Security Analyst Charles Sweethill for discovering the vulnerability, determining the most likely vectors and indicators of compromise, and testing the firewall rule during a holiday. We also wanted to extend kudos the the plugin developer, radykal for quickly developing a patch for this issue.*

Subject: [FD] Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce - Unrestricted File
	Upload

## About Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce
Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin which allows users to design custom products in a vendor's WooCommerce store. It is sold through the third-party marketplace "Envato Market" and boasts over 15,000 sales.

## Unrestricted File Upload
Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce before and including version 4.5.1 contains an Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability.

An unauthenticated attacker is able to upload any type of file to an affected WooCommerce store by exploiting a Time of Check, Time of Use (TOCTOU) weakness in custom-image-handler.php's `url` parameter. However, the file will be saved with one of the following extensions on the server: jpeg, png, or svg.

Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce provides an option to require users to log in before uploading images. However, an attacker is able to access the custom-image-handler.php file directly and upload arbitrary files without authentication.

### Details
The custom-image-handler.php file provides an interface where unauthenticated users can provide the URL of an image and have that image saved on the server. Before saving the file, custom-image-handler.php first checks the MIME type of the file and confirms that it is one of the following: jpeg, png, or svg. Once the file's MIME type has been verified, custom-image-handler.php downloads the file a second time and saves the most recent copy to the filesystem with an extension corresponding to the MIME type of the originally verified file.

This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to the following URL of an affected WooCommerce site:

    /wp-content/plugins/fancy-product-designer/inc/custom-image-handler.php

With this request, the following POST parameters should be sent as form data:
 - saveOnServer: 1
 - uploadsDirURL: https://[affected site]/wp-content/uploads/fancy_products_uploads/
 - uploadsDir: [full path to where the file should be saved on the server]
 - url: [attacker-controlled URL]

The attacker-controlled URL should initially point to a valid file of type: jpeg, png, or svg. Once a request has been made for the file, the attacker can replace the file at the attacker-controlled URL with a malicious file, and the malicious file will be saved on the server. The URL of the uploaded file will then be returned to the attacker in response to the POST request.

Note: The default values for the `uploadsDirURL` and `uploadsDir` parameters can be found by searching for the same strings in the source of any page using an affected version of Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce. Attackers are also able to provide local file paths, which will cause FPD to copy the specified file into the uploads directory if the file is one of the expected types and the server is running with sufficient permissions to read the file.

### Impact
The fact that the uploaded file will have one of the previously mentioned extensions greatly mitigates the impact of this vulnerability, as none of the allowed extensions will be executed by the server. The following scenarios are plausible by abusing this vulnerability:
 - Stored XSS by uploading an SVG containing a malicious JavaScript payload
 - Malware distribution by uploading malicious binaries and other payloads

### Proof of Concept
 - Exploit code: [poc.php](<https://github.com/jdgregson/Disclosures/blob/master/fancy-product-designer/unrestricted-file-upload/poc.php>)
 - Demo video: [unrestricted-file-upload.mp4](<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdgregson/Disclosures/master/fancy-product-designer/unrestricted-file-upload/unrestricted-file-upload.mp4>)

# Critical Zero-Day Flaw Actively Exploited in WordPress Fancy Product Designer Plugin

* Post author:[Kumarswamy S](https://www.secpod.com/blog/author/kumarswamys/ "Posts by Kumarswamy S")
* Post published:June 3, 2021
* Reading time:6 mins read

A critical zero-day [vulnerability](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/) has been discovered in a WordPress plugin called Fancy Product Designer. A Wordfence Threat Intelligence team from WordPress security company Defiant alerted about this vulnerability. The vulnerability is under active attack, which is tracked as [**CVE-2021-24370**](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2021-24370) by using a [vulnerability scanning tool](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/). Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the firewall’s built-in file upload protection, which blocks malicious file upload. As a result, attackers can deploy PHP files and execute them. To mitigate this vulnerability, we can use a [patch management solution](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/).

Fancy Product Designer is a premium plugin for WordPress, WooCommerce, and [Shopify stores](https://tagshop.ai/blog/shopify-store-examples/). It allows customers to design and customize their products of any kind. It also enables customers to upload images and pdf files of the products to their website.  Fancy Product Designer plugin is installed on more than 17000 websites.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerability Details ([**CVE-2021-24370**](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2021-24370))

A critical (CVSS Score: 9.8) unauthenticated arbitrary file upload and remote code execution vulnerability is found in the Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce. Though Wordfence firewall has built-in file upload protection that blocks malicious file upload, it was possible to bypass the protection mechanism in some configurations. Also, it is possible to exploit the flaw even when the plugin has been deactivated.

However, successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload malicious PHP files, execute remote code on the site with the plugin installed, and aid in full site takeover. Moreover, according to the Wordfence security team’s analysis, attackers are trying to fetch order information from e-commerce site’s databases. Since this information usually contains customer’s personal details, an e-commerce site using a vulnerable version of the plugin ends up violating PCI-DSS compliance.

#### **The following are the Indicators of Compromise:**

Usually, successful exploitation allows the attackers to place a file in subfolders of `wp-admin`

or `wp-content/plugins/fancy-product-designer/inc`

##### **For Ex:**

`wp-content/plugins/fancy-product-designer/inc/2021/05/30/4fa00001c720b30102987d980e62d5e4.php`

or

`wp-admin/2021/05/31/4fa00001c720b30102987d980e62d5e4.php`

##### Followings are the list files used in this attack and their MD5 hash as per Wordfence:

| File | MD5 | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ass.php | 3783701c82396cc96d842839a291e813 | This is the initial payload, a dropper that then retrieves additional malware from a 3rd party site. |

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Fancy Product Designer < 4.6.9 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload and RCE

### Description

The plugin allows unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files, resulting in remote code execution. The issue is being actively exploited, and no patch is available. Further details will be made available once pathed.

### Proof of Concept

The Custom Product Designer plugin for WordPress offers the ability for customers to upload images and PDF files via the custom-image-handler.php. On sites running Apache, this file must be loaded via the “fpd\_custom\_uplod\_file” AJAX action, whereas on sites running NGINX this file can be accessed directly, as the .htaccess rule blocking access to this file will not be processed on NGINX.
Regardless of how the file is accessed, it is possible to use the custom image handler to upload executable PHP files. This is possible because the FPD\_Image\_Utils::sanitize\_filename method in fpd-image-utils checks for malicious extensions on the unsanitized version of the supplied filename. In other words, it’s possible to supply a file with a “filename” of “.p h p” or “.p-h-p”. Both of these pass the malicious file extension check, but are sanitized down to “.php”, and are added to the site in a filename with a unique id ending in PHP (e.g. 1d4609806ff0f4e89a3fb5fa35678fa0.php).
An example POST body is listed below though it would be good to not display it until the vulnerability has been patched:

 Automate Patching for Faster Deployment

Manual patching cycles are tedious and time-consuming. With the SanerNow automated patch management tool, configure end-to-end workflows for automatic patching and fix risks faster than ever. Schedule automated patching tasks and make patching a hands-free task. It also supports the upload of pre and post-remediation scripts.

 Test and Approve Patches for Zero-Disruption

Applying new patches directly to the production environment is risky. SanerNow patch management software enables you to create a test environment to test the new patches to verify compatibility. Later, deploy the approved patches across the devices in your production environment and prevent any disruptions and productivity errors.

 Perimeter-Less Patching with a Single, light-weight Agent

SanerNow auto patching software is an ideal solution for hybrid workforces. You can easily deploy patches across globally distributed devices from a centralized cloud patch management solution. Furthermore, all the patching tasks, from scanning to deployment, are executed by a single lightweight multifunctional agent installed in the endpoints. You can also go for the agent-less option, which is a unique approach to scanning while retaining the scan speed and accuracy.

 Risk based Prioritization to Deploy Patches Smartly

SanerNow auto patching tool thoroughly assesses the patches and prioritizes them based on their business context, technical impact, severity level, and more intelligence to help focus on critical patches immediately. Additionally, you can deploy these patches quickly to reduce risk exposure and plan your remediation efforts wisely.

 Firmware Patches for Complete Risk Mitigation

As important as the software application patches, firmware patches are critical to tightening IT security. Moreover, it is recommended to include firmware patching as you establish your automated patch management cadence to reduce security risk exposure. SanerNow patch manager supports patching for firmware updates to fix issues and errors in firmware.

 Continuous and Customizable Patch Scans to Identify Missing Patches

Move away from the periodic scans and make it a continuous process with SanerNow patch management software. Keep your patching up-to-date with customized, real-time, and continuous scans for verified patches based on your IT environment. You can additionally perform real-time, on-demand, scheduled, and automated patch scans with the SanerNow patch management tool.

 Cross-Platform Patching with Support for Third-Party Apps

SanerNow patch management tool supports multi-platform patching for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 550+ third-party applications. SanerNow’s automated patching solution additionally maintains a pre-built patch repository for third-party application patches.

 Effortless Patch Rollback for an Error-Prone Patching

Patch rollback is made easier with the SanerNow automated patch management tool to avoid disruptions in business operations. It rollbacks the last stable version with zero downtime and a single click to easily deal with incompatible and error-prone software patches.

 Comply with Industry Benchmarks and Security Standards

Various industry regulatory standards and organizations mandate patch compliance. SanerNow auto patch management software provides a unified view of your software patch compliance to address deviations from compliance standards and deploy patches accordingly. However, with auto patching in SanerNow, you can quickly fix the misconfigurations and achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

 Insights and Tracking with Reports and Audit Logs

Track detailed insights on your patching metrics with auto-generated reports and an inbuilt audit log. SanerNow automated patch management software provides a wide range of reports to assess the patching status in your network. Additionally, SanerNow provides an insightful Patch Impact Report to analyze the impact of patches and track the patching activities.

# Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce - Unrestricted File Upload

---

*From*: Jonathan Gregson via Fulldisclosure <fulldisclosure () seclists org>

*Date*: Sun, 15 Nov 2020 19:10:59 +0000

---

```
## About Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce
Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin which allows users to design custom products in a vendor's
WooCommerce store. It is sold through the third-party marketplace "Envato Market" and boasts over 15,000 sales.

## Unrestricted File Upload
Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce before and including version 4.5.1 contains an Unrestricted File Upload
vulnerability.

An unauthenticated attacker is able to upload any type of file to an affected WooCommerce store by exploiting a Time of
Check, Time of Use (TOCTOU) weakness in custom-image-handler.php's `url` parameter. However, the file will be saved
with one of the following extensions on the server: jpeg, png, or svg.

Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce provides an option to require users to log in before uploading images. However,
an attacker is able to access the custom-image-handler.php file directly and upload arbitrary files without
authentication.

### Details
The custom-image-handler.php file provides an interface where unauthenticated users can provide the URL of an image and
have that image saved on the server. Before saving the file, custom-image-handler.php first checks the MIME type of the
file and confirms that it is one of the following: jpeg, png, or svg. Once the file's MIME type has been verified,
custom-image-handler.php downloads the file a second time and saves the most recent copy to the filesystem with an
extension corresponding to the MIME type of the originally verified file.

This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to the following URL of an affected WooCommerce site:

    /wp-content/plugins/fancy-product-designer/inc/custom-image-handler.php

With this request, the following POST parameters should be sent as form data:
 - saveOnServer: 1
 - uploadsDirURL: https://[affected site]/wp-content/uploads/fancy_products_uploads/
 - uploadsDir: [full path to where the file should be saved on the server]
 - url: [attacker-controlled URL]

The attacker-controlled URL should initially point to a valid file of type: jpeg, png, or svg. Once a request has been
made for the file, the attacker can replace the file at the attacker-controlled URL with a malicious file, and the
malicious file will be saved on the server. The URL of the uploaded file will then be returned to the attacker in
response to the POST request.

Note: The default values for the `uploadsDirURL` and `uploadsDir` parameters can be found by searching for the same
strings in the source of any page using an affected version of Fancy Product Designer for WooCommerce. Attackers are
also able to provide local file paths, which will cause FPD to copy the specified file into the uploads directory if
the file is one of the expected types and the server is running with sufficient permissions to read the file.

### Impact
The fact that the uploaded file will have one of the previously mentioned extensions greatly mitigates the impact of
this vulnerability, as none of the allowed extensions will be executed by the server. The following scenarios are
plausible by abusing this vulnerability:
 - Stored XSS by uploading an SVG containing a malicious JavaScript payload
 - Malware distribution by uploading malicious binaries and other payloads

### Proof of Concept
 - Exploit code:
[poc.php](<https://github.com/jdgregson/Disclosures/blob/master/fancy-product-designer/unrestricted-file-upload/poc.php>)
 - Demo video:
[unrestricted-file-upload.mp4](<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdgregson/Disclosures/master/fancy-product-designer/unrestricted-file-upload/unrestricted-file-upload.mp4>)
