## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Quiz And Survey Master < 7.3.2 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape the Quiz Url Slug setting before outputting it in some pages, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the Quiz Url Slug setting: "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
Create a quiz and publish it. The XSS will be triggered when editing the Quizz (ie wp-admin/admin.php?page=mlw\_quiz\_options&quiz\_id=4), or accessing the Quizzes/Surveys page (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mlw\_quiz\_list)

### Affects Plugins
