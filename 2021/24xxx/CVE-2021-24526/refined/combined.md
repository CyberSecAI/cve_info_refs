## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Form Maker < 1.13.60 - Authenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not escape its Form Title before outputting it in an attribute when editing a form in the admin dashboard, leading to an authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue

### Proof of Concept

Create or edit a form and add the following payload in the Form Title field "autofocus onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)// save it and move the mouse over the Title field
Edit (WPScanTeam): better payload (no interaction needed other than editing the affected Form): " style="animation-name:rotation" onanimationstart="alert(/XSS/)//
