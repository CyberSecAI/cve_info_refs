- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Form Maker plugin fails to properly sanitize the "Form Title" field before outputting it in an attribute when editing a form within the admin dashboard. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the form title.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of output escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the affected form within the admin dashboard. This could allow them to perform malicious actions like stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or modifying content.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious payload into the "Form Title" field via the admin dashboard. The payload is stored in the database and executed when the form is viewed/edited.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to edit forms.
