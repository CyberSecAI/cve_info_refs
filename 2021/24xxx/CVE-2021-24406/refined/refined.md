- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `wpForo Forum` plugin failed to properly validate the `redirect_to` parameter in the login form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open redirect vulnerability, specifically CWE-601.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious login URL that, upon successful login, redirects the user to a website controlled by the attacker. This can be used for phishing attacks where the attacker creates a replica of the legitimate site, tricking users into re-entering their credentials, which the attacker then gains access to.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted URL with a malicious redirect parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious redirect and induce the user to use the malicious URL.
