# wpForo Forum < 1.9.7 - Open Redirect

### Description

The plugin did not validate the redirect\_to parameter in the login form of the forum, leading to an open redirect issue after a successful login. Such issue could allow an attacker to induce a user to use a login URL redirecting to a website under their control and being a replica of the legitimate one, asking them to re-enter their credentials (which will then in the attacker hands)

### Proof of Concept

Login to the forum using the following URL: https://example.com/community/?foro=signin&redirect\_to=https://wpscan.com
