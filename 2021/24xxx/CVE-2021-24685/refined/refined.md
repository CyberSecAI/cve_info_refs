- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not enforce nonce checks when saving its settings and fails to sanitize and escape them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can make a logged-in administrator change the plugin settings with a Cross-Site Scripting payload, which can then be triggered on either the frontend or backend, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can use a crafted form to submit a malicious payload to the plugin's settings page. The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to craft a form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, will execute the provided XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting the crafted form, usually via social engineering or similar methods.
    - The attacker does not need to be logged into the website.
