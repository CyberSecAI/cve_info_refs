Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `wp-display-users` WordPress plugin, specifically in the `/includes/forms/display-users-manage-role.php` file, line 180.
- The plugin uses the `$_GET['id']` parameter directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization, escaping, or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, successful SQL injection can lead to gaining higher privileges or full system control.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially reveal database structure and information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted GET request to the WordPress admin panel.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`. Specifically, `admin.php?page=display-users&tab=manage-role&action=edit&id=[MALICIOUS SQL CODE]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs administrator-level access to the WordPress admin panel to exploit this vulnerability.
