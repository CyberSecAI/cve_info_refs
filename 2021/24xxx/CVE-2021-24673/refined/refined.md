- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input in the Calendar Form settings, specifically the "Form Name" and "Description" fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of output escaping allows malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed in the context of other users' browsers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed when a user interacts with the affected calendar. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the "Form Name" and "Description" fields in the Calendar Form settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have admin privileges (or at least high privileges) to access the plugin's settings and modify the calendar form. The unfiltered_html capability can be disallowed and the XSS will still be triggered.
