- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of the Product fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** High privilege users can perform XSS attacks, even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding/editing a product and injecting malicious payloads into the Product Affiliate URL, Custom Button Text, or Product Description fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have high privileges (Admin+) to add or edit products. The XSS will be triggered when viewing the Product on a page or when editing the Product in the admin dashboard.
