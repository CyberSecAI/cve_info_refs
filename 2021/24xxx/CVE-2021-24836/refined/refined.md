- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect authorization, lack of CSRF protection
- **Impact of exploitation**: A logged-in user with minimal privileges (e.g., a subscriber) can modify the plugin settings, such as setting the default user role to 'editor', potentially granting higher privileges and access.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/index.php` endpoint with the malicious plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user, such as a subscriber, on the affected WordPress site.
