- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin's `sid` shortcode parameter was not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can extract data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries using the vulnerable shortcode parameter, by observing the error messages returned by the server, indicating whether the injected condition is true or false.
- **Attack vectors**:  A user with contributor or higher privileges can insert a malicious `sid` parameter in a `yesno_chart` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a registered user with at least contributor privileges. The attacker needs to insert the malicious shortcode into a page or post on the WordPress site. The attacker needs to know that the plugin is installed and vulnerable, and that the website administrator has created a question set and a question (which is usually the case).
