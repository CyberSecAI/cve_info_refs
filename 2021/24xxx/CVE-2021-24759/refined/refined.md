- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input within shortcode and Gutenberg Block attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious javascript code into the `search_term` attribute of the `pdfjs-viewer` shortcode or the `searchText` attribute within the `pdfjsblock/pdfjs-embed` Gutenberg block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least the Contributor role within WordPress, allowing them to create or edit content where they can insert the vulnerable shortcode or Gutenberg block.
