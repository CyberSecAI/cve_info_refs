The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-24116.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a non-constant time implementation for base64 decoding within WolfSSL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the use of a lookup table during base64 decoding, specifically when handling keys stored as PEM files. This implementation is not constant-time.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By monitoring the accessed cache lines during key decoding, an attacker can potentially obtain key information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is a side-channel attack that exploits cache timing differences during base64 decoding.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to monitor cache line accesses during the decoding process. The attack has been demonstrated in Intel SGX, suggesting the need for a specific execution environment or the ability to perform similar observation techniques.
