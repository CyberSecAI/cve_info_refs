  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize some of its settings before outputting them in frontend pages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Allows high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed. The XSS will be triggered in all frontend pages.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting a malicious script payload into the plugin's settings (specifically, the Message setting).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "High privilege users (Admin+) are required to inject the malicious script."
