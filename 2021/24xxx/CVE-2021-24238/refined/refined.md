Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks when deleting properties within the Realteo plugin. The plugin, used by the Findeo theme, did not verify if the user requesting a property deletion was actually the owner of that property.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability is an IDOR, meaning the application exposes a direct reference to an internal implementation object, and the attacker can manipulate these references to bypass authorization.
*   **Broken Access Control:** The application fails to enforce proper access controls, allowing users to perform actions on resources they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Property Deletion:** An authenticated user (even a low-privileged user like a subscriber) could delete any property on the site by manipulating the `property_id` parameter in the delete request, regardless of ownership.
*   **Data Loss:** Exploitation leads to the removal of property listings, potentially impacting site functionality and user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/my-properties/` endpoint.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `property_id` parameter in the request to target specific properties for deletion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a registered user on the WordPress site. No special privileges are required; even a basic subscriber account is sufficient.
*   **Knowledge of Property IDs:** The attacker needs to know or guess the `property_id` of the properties they want to delete.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects the Realteo plugin prior to version 1.2.4 and the Findeo theme prior to version 1.3.1
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key)
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.1 (High)
*   The vulnerability was discovered by m0ze.
