- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Simple Social Media Share Buttons` plugin failed to properly sanitize the `align` and `like_button_size` parameters within its `SSB` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into website content, which will be executed when a user views the page. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the `SSB` shortcode and injecting malicious JavaScript into the `align` and `like_button_size` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with Contributor+ role can exploit this vulnerability, meaning they have the capability to create and edit posts/content where shortcodes are processed.
