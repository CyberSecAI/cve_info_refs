{
  "CVE-2021-24762": {
    "Description": "The plugin does not validate and escape the question_id GET parameter before using it in a SQL statement in the get_question AJAX action, allowing unauthenticated users to perform SQL injection.",
    "Root cause": "The plugin fails to sanitize the `question_id` GET parameter before using it in a SQL query.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Lack of Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this case, it's demonstrated by extracting user login and password hashes.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via the `get_question` AJAX action by crafting a malicious `question_id` parameter in a GET request.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs no authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They simply need to send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`)."
