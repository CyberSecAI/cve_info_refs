- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Product Code when creating Product Shortcodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** High privilege users can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Product Code field. When a page including the product's shortcode is viewed by a visitor, the injected script will execute, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Injecting a XSS payload into the "Product Code" form field when creating a "New product shortcode".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high privilege user (Admin+) to create or modify product shortcodes.
