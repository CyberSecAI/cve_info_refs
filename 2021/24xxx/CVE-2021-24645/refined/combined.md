## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Booking.com Product Helper < 1.0.2 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape Product Code when creating Product Shortcode, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

When creating a "New product shortcode" you can inject XSS payloads like <--`<img/src=` onerror=confirm``> --!> in the Product Code form field. When a page that includes that product's shortcode is viewed by a visitor, the payload will execute.
