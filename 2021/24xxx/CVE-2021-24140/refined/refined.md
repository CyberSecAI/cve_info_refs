**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Ajax Load More WordPress plugin was vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a specially crafted `repeater` parameter. Example `repeater=' or sleep(5)#&type=test`
