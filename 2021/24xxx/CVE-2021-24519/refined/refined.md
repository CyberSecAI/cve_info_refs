- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize the 'Text Next to Icon' field when adding or editing a characteristic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Text Next to Icon' field. When other users view the characteristics list, the injected script will execute in their browsers, potentially leading to various malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to malicious websites
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the 'Text Next to Icon' field when adding or editing a characteristic within the plugin's administrative interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high-level privileges (e.g., admin) to access the plugin's settings and add or edit characteristics.
