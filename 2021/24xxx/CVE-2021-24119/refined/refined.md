Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a non-constant time implementation of base64 decoding within mbed TLS. Specifically, the usage of a lookup table during base64 decoding is the root cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Side-Channel Vulnerability:** The non-constant time implementation allows for a side-channel attack where an attacker can observe the accessed cache lines during key decoding.
- **Information Disclosure:** By monitoring the cache lines, an attacker can deduce information about the cryptographic key being decoded.
- **Non-Constant Time Operation:** The implementation is not designed to take the same amount of time, regardless of the input, making it susceptible to timing-based attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can potentially extract sensitive key information from PEM files being decoded, leading to compromise of cryptographic secrets.
- **Loss of Confidentiality:** By obtaining the keys, an attacker could decrypt encrypted communication or data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cache Timing Analysis:** An attacker needs to perform cache timing analysis to observe the memory access patterns during the base64 decoding process.
- **Local Access (Demonstrated in Intel SGX):** The provided materials mention that the attack was demonstrated in an Intel SGX environment, suggesting that the attacker needs to have some level of local access to the system running the vulnerable mbedtls implementation or the ability to observe the cache activity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **System-Level Access:** The attacker needs some means of observing cache line activity, which is typically something that a system-level attacker or a process running inside a SGX enclave is capable of doing.
- **Timing Measurement:** The attacker requires the ability to perform precise timing measurements to differentiate access patterns.
- **Knowledge of Base64 and mbedtls:** The attacker requires a knowledge of how base64 decoding and mbedtls work.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is related to base64 decoding used when handling PEM files, which commonly store cryptographic keys.
- The vulnerability was addressed in mbed TLS version 2.26.0.
-  The vulnerability is also present in other libraries with similar base64 decoding implementation: WolfSSL and Rust SGX

The provided information offers more details than a typical CVE description, including the specific attack vector, and the affected component (base64 decoding in PEM file processing) within Mbed TLS, and the context in which the attack was demonstrated. It also highlights that similar vulnerabilities exists in other libraries.
