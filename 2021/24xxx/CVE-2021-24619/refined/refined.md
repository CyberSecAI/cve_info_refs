The content is related to the CVE.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-controlled input in its settings, allowing the injection of malicious HTML. This occurs even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user with high privileges (e.g., an administrator) can inject malicious HTML code through the plugin's settings. This injected code is then executed when other users view a page on the affected website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges (administrator or similar role) to modify the plugin's settings.
