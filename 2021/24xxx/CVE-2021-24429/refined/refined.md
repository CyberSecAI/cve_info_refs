- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the First Name field when booking an appointment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the First Name field when booking an appointment. When an administrator visits the "Calendar" page, this injected script is executed in the administrator's context, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or further malicious actions within the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by booking an appointment (either as an unauthenticated or authenticated user) and placing a malicious payload in the First Name field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the booking form and submit a booking with the malicious payload. This can be done either as an unauthenticated user or any authenticated user.
