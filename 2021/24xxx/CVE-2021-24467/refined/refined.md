- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not verify the CSRF nonce when saving its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can make a logged-in admin update the plugin settings via a CSRF attack, leading to XSS. This can be achieved by modifying the URL of the JavaScript library used, or by using malicious attributions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, will send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable plugin settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the crafted malicious HTML page, which will trigger the CSRF attack and exploit the lack of CSRF protection.
