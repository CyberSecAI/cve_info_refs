Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary Text File Deletion via CSRF

**Root Cause:** The plugin lacks proper security measures when deleting log files. Specifically:

1.  **Missing Nonce Check:** The plugin does not verify a nonce when deleting a log file. A nonce is a unique, unpredictable token to protect against CSRF attacks.
2.  **Lack of Path Traversal Prevention:** The plugin does not sanitize or validate the input provided for the file to be deleted. This allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences (like `../`) to navigate outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   Path Traversal

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting arbitrary text files on the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CSRF:** The attacker crafts a malicious request that is then executed by an authenticated administrator in the vulnerable plugin.
*   **Path Traversal:**  The attacker uses sequences like `../` in the filename parameter to navigate to and delete files outside of the intended log directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into triggering the malicious request.
*   The attacker does not need to be logged in to the WordPress admin panel, but the victim needs to be logged in.

**Additional Notes:**
*   On web servers other than Windows, the directory `/wp-content/plugins/error-log-viewer/saved_logs/` must exist for the attack to work. However, on Windows servers this directory does not need to exist.
*   The proof of concept shows how to delete the `readme.txt` file of the plugin using a crafted URL.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.2.
