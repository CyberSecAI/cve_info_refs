## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Error Log Viewer < 1.1.2 - Arbitrary Text File Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not perform nonce check when deleting a log file and does not have path traversal prevention, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin delete arbitrary text files on the web server.

### Proof of Concept

On Web Servers other than Windows, the /wp-content/plugins/error-log-viewer/saved\_logs/ folder must exist for the attack to be successful, on Windows ones, there is no need for it
To delete the readme.txt of the plugin: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rrrlgvwr-monitor.php&saved\_logs\_action=delete&rrrlgvwr\_check\_del=../readme
