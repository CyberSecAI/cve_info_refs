- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape parameters of its `wonderplugin_video` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Input sanitization is missing when handling the shortcode parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers who view the affected content. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Contributor level access or higher can inject the malicious shortcode in posts/pages/comments that will be parsed by the WordPress engine and rendered for all site visitors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker must have at least Contributor level access to the WordPress site. This allows the attacker to create or edit content with the vulnerable shortcode.
