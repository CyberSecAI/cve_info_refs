## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Paypal Donation < 1.3.1 - CSRF to Arbitrary Post Deletion

### Description

The plugin provides a function to create donation buttons which are internally stored as posts. The deletion of a button is not CSRF protected and there is no control to check if the deleted post was a button post. As a result, an attacker could make logged in admins delete arbitrary posts

### Proof of Concept

https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpedon\_buttons&action=delete&inline=true&product=<target post id>
