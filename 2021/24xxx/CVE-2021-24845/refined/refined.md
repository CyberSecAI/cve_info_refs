- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Improved Include Page plugin allows shortcode attributes `post_type` and `post_status` to be passed, which can be used to retrieve arbitrary content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control due to the ability to specify `post_type` and `post_status` parameters in the shortcode.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Users with Contributor role or higher can gain access to content they are not supposed to access, such as drafts and private posts.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a shortcode with specific `post_type` and `post_status` attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a user with a Contributor role or higher to be able to create content with shortcodes.
