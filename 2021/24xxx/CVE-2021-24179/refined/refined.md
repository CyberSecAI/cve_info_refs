- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection and file validation, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability: Allows an attacker to make a logged-in administrator import files.
    - Inadequate file validation: Allows the upload of malicious files, such as PHP scripts within a ZIP archive.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) - by uploading and executing malicious PHP code, an attacker can gain control of the server.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - A malicious user crafts a CSRF attack to trigger a file upload
    - Malicious files can be placed within a zip archive and uploaded
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an import action.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
