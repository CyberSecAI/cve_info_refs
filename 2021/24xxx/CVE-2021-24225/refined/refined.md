Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24225:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `calId` GET parameter in the "Seasons & Calendars" page of the Advanced Booking Calendar plugin. This unsanitized parameter was then outputted within an HTML `<a>` tag, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, meaning the malicious script is injected via a request and reflected back in the response. The vulnerability occurs because the plugin directly uses user-controlled input (the `calId` GET parameter) in an HTML context without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable page. When a user clicks the crafted link, the attacker's script executes within the user's browser session.
*   **Potential for Sensitive Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker can use the XSS to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or alter the content of the page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with the `calId` parameter containing XSS payload.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would typically need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link (e.g., through phishing emails).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No Privilege Required:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability as it's a reflected XSS that relies on user interaction.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Links:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to lure a user into clicking on the crafted link.
*   **Targeted User must be Authenticated:** The targeted user must be authenticated to the wordpress site to access the vulnerable page.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided content includes example payloads that were used to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.7 of the plugin.
*   The wpscan.com content also provides links to relevant information such as the CVE, the OWASP Top 10 entry for XSS, and the CWE entry.
*   The Trac changeset log shows the exact line where the sanitization was added, and also shows version updates.
