- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The youForms for WordPress plugin does not sanitize or escape the Button Text field within its Templates. This lack of proper input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, redirecting users to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by creating or editing a template and injecting malicious JavaScript code in the Button text/Button subtext/Header text/Header subtext fields. Specifically within the Change button template text/Change template modal text sections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high-privilege user access (editors or admins). This user can then create/edit templates, inject the malicious script, and trigger the XSS when the template is viewed within the admin dashboard. The vulnerability can be exploited even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.
