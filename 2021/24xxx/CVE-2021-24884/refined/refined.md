Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24884:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `data-frmverify` attribute used in links within the Formidable Forms plugin. This attribute is used to display confirmation messages in a modal before certain actions are performed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into the `data-frmverify` attribute. This injected code is then rendered in the confirmation modal, leading to XSS.
*   **HTML Injection**: The plugin allows certain HTML tags like `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<img>`, `<a>` and `<button>`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser when they view a form entry.
*   **CSRF exploitation:** Successful exploitation in combination with CSRF could allow an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user.
*   **Account Takeover:** The injected script can steal the user's account by changing their password.
*  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can submit malicious code through an authenticated user and edit PHP code if the user has the ability to do so.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  By exploiting the XSS in combination with CSRF, a low privileged user may gain high privileged access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attack:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject the malicious code.
*   **HTML Injection:** HTML injection is used to trick authenticated users into following the malicious link.
*   **Data-frmverify Attribute:** The malicious payload is injected via the `data-frmverify` attribute in the form entry inspection page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the malicious HTML.
*   The attacker must be able to create a form entry with a malicious `data-frmverify` attribute value.
*  The victim needs to be an authenticated user who can view the affected form entries.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform an RCE by modifying the `index.php` file of the WordPress theme.
* The PoC uses `XMLHttpRequest` to retrieve the WordPress nonce and then uses another `XMLHttpRequest` to send a crafted POST request to modify the theme file.

**Vulnerable versions:**
*   Formidable Form Builder versions prior to 4.09.05 are vulnerable.

**Fix:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.09.05 by sanitizing the `data-frmverify` attribute

**CVSS Score:**
* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (High)
