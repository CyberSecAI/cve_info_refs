Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24557

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress M-vSlider plugin, versions 2.1.3 and below.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugin's update functionality in the `rslider_page` uses the `rs_id` POST parameter without proper validation, sanitization, or escaping before including it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The lack of proper input handling allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `rs_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- Potential consequences include data breaches, modification, or deletion, privilege escalation, and complete compromise of the WordPress application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rslider_page&updated=true`.
- The `rs_id` POST parameter is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with "Administrator" privileges to access the vulnerable page and parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `rslider.php` at line 374: `$updatequery .= " WHERE rs_id = " . $_POST['rs_id'];`

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
A sample HTTP POST request is provided demonstrating how to inject a SQL query using a `SLEEP()` function to confirm the vulnerability.
A SQLMap command is also provided to show how to automate the exploit process.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on July 23, 2021.
- The plugin was closed on May 19, 2021.
- The vulnerability was rated as High severity with a CVSS score of 7.2
