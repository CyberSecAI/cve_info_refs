Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24174:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The WordPress plugin "Database Backups" versions 1.2.2.6 and earlier lack CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The plugin fails to validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their consent.
*   **Insecure backup storage:** Database backups are created in the `/wp-content/uploads/database-backups` directory without access restrictions. This makes them accessible to anyone who can guess the file path, especially if directory listing is enabled on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can force a logged-in user to:
    *   Generate database backups.
    *   Change plugin settings.
    *   Delete backups.
*   If backups are successfully created, an attacker might be able to gain access to the database by accessing the backup files which contain sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF attack:**  An attacker could craft a malicious HTML page or link that, when accessed by a logged-in user, sends a request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin, triggering actions such as backup creation or settings changes without the user's knowledge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.4 (High), which reflects the potential impact.
* The vulnerability is classified under OWASP top 10 as "A2: Broken Authentication and Session Management".
* The related CWE is CWE-352, which is "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)".
