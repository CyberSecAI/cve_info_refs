The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24349.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of filenames before being output in an error message when they have an invalid extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized filename output.
- Lack of CSRF protection, which allows attackers to perform the attack via a CSRF vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the error message, which will be executed in the victim's browser, leading to various attacks such as:
- Stealing cookies
- Redirecting users to malicious sites
- Defacing websites
- Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by uploading a file with a malicious filename (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert(1337)>`).
- The attack can be performed via a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- Due to the lack of CSRF protection, the attacker can potentially induce a victim to make the malicious POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker can be an external user.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to upload a file with a malicious filename (or craft a CSRF attack).
