- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the 'Name' fields of booked events before outputting them in the Orders admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the 'Name' fields of booked events. When an administrator views the Orders page in the admin dashboard, the malicious script is executed in the administrator's browser, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or further compromise of the site.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated user can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to book an event and insert the XSS payload into the 'Buyer Info First or Last Name' field. No specific privileges are needed, as the vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
