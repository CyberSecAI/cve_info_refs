Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `Simple 301 Redirects` plugin has an AJAX action (`simple301redirects/admin/activate_plugin`) that allows activation of arbitrary plugins.
*   This action lacks proper capability checks to verify if the user is authorized to perform this action.
*   It uses a nonce check (`wp_rest`) that is meant for REST API, which is accessible to any authenticated user, making it possible to bypass the nonce check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to the plugin activation functionality, allowing low-privileged authenticated users to perform administrative actions.
*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The plugin doesn't verify if the user has sufficient capabilities to activate plugins.
*   **Insecure nonce usage:** The plugin uses a REST API nonce which can be easily obtained by any authenticated user, bypassing intended security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with any authenticated user account (e.g., subscriber) can activate any plugin installed on the WordPress site.
*   This can be used to activate malicious plugins or plugins with known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to complete site compromise.
*   An attacker can gain further access and escalate their privileges by activating a malicious plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests to the WordPress site's `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the WordPress site, any authenticated user account will suffice.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a user account on the target WordPress site (any role including subscriber).
*   The attacker can be an external user and does not need to be on the internal network of the server.
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the site, including POST requests with the necessary parameters for the AJAX action.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.3 of the Simple 301 Redirects plugin.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.4.
*   The provided proof of concept code demonstrates how an attacker can log in, retrieve the REST API nonce, and use it to activate an arbitrary plugin.
*   This vulnerability is related to but distinct from other vulnerabilities patched in the same update (CVE-2021-24352, CVE-2021-24353, CVE-2021-24354, and CVE-2021-24355).
