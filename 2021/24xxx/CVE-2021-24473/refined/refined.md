The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24473.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) issue in the "User Profile Picture" plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- IDOR vulnerability allows unauthorized access to user profile pictures.
- Lack of proper authorization checks when modifying or deleting user profile pictures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Users with the `upload_image` capability (typically authors and above) can change or delete profile pictures of other users, even those with higher roles like administrators.
- This can lead to user impersonation, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed by sending POST requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- The `user_id` parameter in the request is manipulated to target different users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a WordPress account with the `upload_image` capability (author or higher role).
- They also need access to the WordPress admin panel.
- They must be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using a proxy like Burp Suite).
