- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize the `sdm_active_tab` GET parameter and `sdm_stats_start_date`/`sdm_stats_end_date` POST parameters before outputting them within HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Via a crafted URL with a malicious `sdm_active_tab` parameter.
    - Via a crafted form submission with malicious `sdm_stats_start_date` or `sdm_stats_end_date` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link or form that a victim will access. No authentication is required. The attacker does not need any special position.

The provided content includes two Proof of Concept scenarios. The first one is specific to Firefox due to an `onclick+accesskey` trick on a hidden input, while the second one does not have browser requirements and injects the payload via form submission. This information is more detailed than the official CVE description.
