- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Form Name before outputting it in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users who access the affected page. This can allow the attacker to perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** A high-privilege user (Admin+) can inject the malicious payload into the "Form Name" field within the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative (or similarly privileged) access to the WordPress site to edit the form settings. The user must also revisit/edit the form to trigger the XSS.
