## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# You Shang <= 1.0.1 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape its qrcode links settings, which result into Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues in frontend posts and the plugins settings page depending on the payload used

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the wechat\_qrcode settings of the plugin: http://127.0.0.1/"onerror=alert(/XSS/)// and the XSS will be triggered in all frontend posts
The following payload could also be used to only trigger in the plugin's settings page: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//

### Affects Plugins
