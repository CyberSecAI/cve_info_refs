{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not escape its qrcode links settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of the victim's browser when viewing frontend posts or the plugin's settings page.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `wechat_qrcode` settings of the plugin. This payload is then stored in the database. When a user views a frontend post or the plugin's settings page, the stored payload is executed in their browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the plugin's settings page to modify the `wechat_qrcode` setting. This usually requires admin or editor privileges."
