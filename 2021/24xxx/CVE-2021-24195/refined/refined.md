The provided content relates to CVE-2021-24195.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback()` method found in the `settings-start-index.php` file of multiple WP-Buy plugins. This method allows low-privileged users to install or activate arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** Low-privileged users can trigger a function intended for higher-level users, bypassing intended access restrictions.
- **Arbitrary Plugin Installation/Activation:** Attackers can install or activate any plugin, including specific versions, from the WordPress repository.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Installation of Vulnerable Plugins:** Attackers can install vulnerable plugins, potentially leading to more severe vulnerabilities, such as Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Full Site Compromise:** By installing or activating malicious plugins, attackers can take full control of the website.
- **Malware Injection/Content Defacement:** Attackers could inject malware or deface the website with the installed plugins.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, vulnerabilities within installed plugins might lead to the attackers gaining higher privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via an AJAX request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- The attacker sends a POST request with the `action=do_button_job_later` parameter along with either the `slug` parameter to install the specified plugin (including specific versions) or the `plugin_file` parameter to activate an already installed plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have low-privileged user access to the WordPress site.
- The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

The following plugins are listed as affected by the vulnerability:
- wp-content-copy-protector
- conditional-marketing-mailer
- captchinoo-captcha-for-login-form-protection
- wp-maintenance-mode-site-under-construction
