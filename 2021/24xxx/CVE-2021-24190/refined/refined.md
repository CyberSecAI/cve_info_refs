The content provided describes a vulnerability affecting multiple WordPress plugins from the WP-Buy vendor. This vulnerability is related to the following CVEs: CVE-2021-24188, CVE-2021-24189, CVE-2021-24190, CVE-2021-24191, CVE-2021-24192, CVE-2021-24193, CVE-2021-24194, and CVE-2021-24195. The specific vulnerability is within the `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` function, and this analysis focuses on the details related to CVE-2021-24190.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control in the `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` AJAX action. This action allows low-privileged users to install and activate arbitrary plugins without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** Low-privileged users can invoke the `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` AJAX action, which is intended for administrative tasks.
- **Arbitrary Plugin Installation:** The vulnerability allows any user (including low-privileged) to install plugins, including specific versions.
- **Arbitrary Plugin Activation:** The same AJAX action allows any user to activate installed plugins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Installation of Malicious Plugins:** Attackers can install vulnerable plugins that could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other critical vulnerabilities.
- **Site Takeover:** By installing and activating malicious plugins, an attacker can gain complete control of the website.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can deface the site or engage in other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out via HTTP requests.
- **AJAX Action:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker only needs a low-privileged user account on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
- **Knowledge of AJAX Action:** The attacker needs to know the specific AJAX action (`cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback`) and parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `settings-start-index.php` file in the affected plugins.
- The attacker sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action set to `do_button_job_later`.
- To install a plugin, the attacker provides the `slug` parameter in the request, including the specific version desired (e.g., `plugin_slug.version`).
- To activate a plugin, the attacker uses the same request but replaces the `slug` parameter with the `plugin_file` parameter.
