- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape the `result_id` parameter when displaying an existing quiz result page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to privilege escalation if an administrator is tricked into clicking a malicious link.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious link that includes JavaScript code in the `result_id` parameter, an attacker can induce a user to execute the code when they visit the link. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious link to a logged-in admin or user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the malicious javascript code injected in the result\_id parameter and induce a user to click on it.
