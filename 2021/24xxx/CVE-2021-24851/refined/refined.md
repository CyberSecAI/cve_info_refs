### Root cause of vulnerability
The Insert Pages plugin allowed users with a role as low as Contributor to access content and metadata from arbitrary posts/pages, including private ones, using a shortcode. This was due to a lack of proper access control checks when inserting pages.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin did not properly check if a user had the required permissions to view the content of a post/page before displaying it via the shortcode.
- **Information Disclosure:** Private posts and pages, intended to be restricted, were accessible to unauthorized users.

### Impact of exploitation
- Unauthorized access to private posts/pages content and metadata.
- Contributors and other low-privileged users could view content not intended for them.

### Attack vectors
- Exploitation via shortcode: An attacker could use the `[insert page='page_slug' display='all']` shortcode to display the content of any page, including private ones, as long as they knew the page slug.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker must have at least Contributor level access.
- The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the slug of the private post/page they want to access.
