{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not validate and escape the X-Forwarded-For header value before outputting it in the statistic page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the statistic page of the survey.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `X-Forwarded-For` header. When a user views the statistics page, the injected script is executed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send the malicious request from anywhere. The target must view the survey statistic page for the exploit to trigger."
