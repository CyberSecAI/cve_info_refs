Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of HTML tag parameters within various widgets of the "PowerPack Addons for Elementor" plugin. Specifically, the plugin allows users to specify HTML tags for titles and other text elements. While a dropdown menu presents a limited set of tags, it is possible to send a modified request that injects arbitrary HTML tags, including `<script>` tags, into these parameters. This allows for the injection of JavaScript code which is executed when the page is viewed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is saved into the database and executed when a user views the affected page or post.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input for HTML tags, allowing arbitrary HTML and JavaScript to be injected.
*   **Insecure use of Elementor API/widget configuration:** The plugin uses the Elementor API insecurely, failing to enforce HTML tag options on the server-side and instead relies on the client side drop down.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
*   **Site Takeover:** If an administrator views a page with injected JavaScript, the attacker can potentially gain administrative privileges and take over the site.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The injected JavaScript can be used to steal cookies, session data, or manipulate the content of the website.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can use a contributor account to inject the malicious script, which, when executed by an administrator, can lead to an escalation of privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Request Manipulation:** An attacker intercepts and modifies the "save_builder" request to inject malicious code via HTML tag parameters in the affected widgets
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to view or preview a page or post containing the malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Contributor Access or Higher:** Attackers need at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to edit pages and inject the malicious code
*   **Ability to use the Elementor Editor:** Attackers need to be able to access the Elementor editor to create or modify content.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Requires knowledge of how to manipulate HTTP requests or use browser developer tools to modify the request when saving the changes via Elementor builder.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The user viewing the infected page or preview does not need to perform any action other than navigating to the page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in multiple widgets within the plugin
*   The vulnerability is similar to those found in the main Elementor plugin and many other Elementor add-on plugins.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.3.2 of the "PowerPack Addons for Elementor" plugin.
*   The content also lists multiple other plugins affected by the same type of vulnerability.
