Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GeoDirectory WordPress plugin did not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `default_location_latitude` parameter within the plugin's settings page. This allowed for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The malicious script is stored in the database and executed when an admin views the settings page.
- Lack of input sanitization on the `default_location_latitude` parameter

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the administrator's browser session. This could allow an attacker to:
  - Steal session cookies.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the administrator.
  - Redirect the administrator to a malicious website.
  - Modify content or settings within the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload (e.g., `prompt(/xss/)`) and injects it into the `default_location_latitude` parameter on the plugin's settings page.
- The vulnerable parameter is submitted using a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-settings&tab=general&section=location`
- When an admin revisits the same settings page, the stored payload is executed, triggering the XSS vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be logged into WordPress as an administrator or another user with the ability to access and modify the GeoDirectory plugin settings.
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to the WordPress admin interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in GeoDirectory plugin versions prior to 2.1.1.3
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.1.3 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Thinkland Security Team.
