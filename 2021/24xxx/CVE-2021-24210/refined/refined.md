Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-24210:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is an open redirect flaw in the `phast.php` file of the PhastPress WordPress plugin. The plugin was not properly validating the `src` parameter, allowing an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Open Redirect:** The plugin's `phast.php` script redirects users to a URL specified in the `src` parameter without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs using the vulnerable `phast.php` script to redirect users to phishing sites, potentially leading to credential theft or malware infection.
*   **User Misdirection:** By redirecting users to third-party sites, attackers can manipulate users for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URLs:** Attackers can craft a URL that includes the `phast.php` script with a malicious `src` parameter. This URL is then distributed to potential victims.
*   **URL Manipulation:**  The `src` parameter could be manipulated to specify an external URL as the redirect target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication or special privileges.
*   **URL Crafting:** Attackers need to be able to craft a malicious URL with a specified redirect target.
*   **Distribution:** The attacker needs to be able to distribute the crafted URL to potential victims (e.g., via email, social media, etc.).

**Additional Details:**
* The fix implemented in version 1.111 includes a check `self::isSafeRedirectDestination($serviceParams['src'], $httpRequest)` to validate the destination URL and ensure that it is a safe redirect target, comparing the host of the requested URL against the host of the website.
* The vulnerable file is located at `wp-content/plugins/phastpress/phast.php`.
*  The vulnerability is classified as CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')).
* CVSS score of 4.3 (Medium).
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.111 of the plugin.
