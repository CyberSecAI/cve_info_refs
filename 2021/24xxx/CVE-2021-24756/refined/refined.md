- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize, validate, and escape the IP address retrieved from login requests before outputting them in the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts into the activity log, which will then be executed when an administrator views the log. This could allow the attacker to perform actions with administrator privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-login.php` endpoint, including malicious JavaScript code within the `X-Forwarded-For` header, which is then logged by the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication to inject the malicious script. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the `/wp-login.php` endpoint of the WordPress site.
