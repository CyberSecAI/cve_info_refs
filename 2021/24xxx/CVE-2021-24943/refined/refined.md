{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `event_id` parameter in the `rtec_send_unregister_link` AJAX action before using it in a SQL statement.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data extraction (e.g., user emails) and other database modifications.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `rtec_send_unregister_link` and a malicious `event_id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send requests from any location."
