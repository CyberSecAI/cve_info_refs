## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Visual Form Builder < 3.0.4 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or escape its Form Name, allowing high privilege users such as admin to set Cross-Site Scripting payload in them, even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Create a new Form via the plugin, fill it with any values. In the next step, change the Form name to: "/><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)> and save the form
The XSS will be triggered when viewing the forms list (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=visual-form-builder) or when editing the related form
