- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize or escape the Form Name field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser when they view the forms list or edit the related form. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with admin privileges can inject the malicious payload by setting a crafted value to the "Form Name" field during form creation or modification.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to create and modify forms within the vulnerable plugin.
