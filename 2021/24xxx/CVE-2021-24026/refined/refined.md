- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A missing bounds check within the audio decoding pipeline for WhatsApp calls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An out-of-bounds write could be triggered.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a malicious audio file during a WhatsApp call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to initiate a WhatsApp call with the vulnerable user, and send a malicious audio file.
