- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the `order` and `orderby` parameters before using them in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple authenticated blind SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries leading to potential data exfiltration, modification, or other unauthorized database access.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `order` and `orderby` parameters in HTTP GET or POST requests sent to the plugin's admin dashboard.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator-level privileges to access the vulnerable endpoints.
