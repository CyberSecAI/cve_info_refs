### Root cause of vulnerability
The ProfilePress plugin does not properly escape the `data` parameter of the `pp_get_forms_by_builder_type` AJAX action before outputting it within an HTML attribute, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is specifically a reflected XSS, where the malicious script is injected via a request parameter and immediately executed in the user's browser.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Arbitrary script execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Data exfiltration:** The attacker may use this to steal sensitive information like session cookies.
- **Website defacement:** The attacker may modify the look and behavior of the web page.
- **Malicious redirections:** The attacker may redirect the victim to another malicious website.
- **Phishing:** An attacker may inject a fake login form to steal user credentials.

### Attack vectors
- **AJAX request:** The attacker crafts a malicious AJAX request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, including a `data` parameter containing the XSS payload.
- **User interaction:**  A victim needs to be tricked into submitting the crafted form.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.
- **Victim's browser:** The attack requires the victim's browser to be tricked into sending a crafted request.
