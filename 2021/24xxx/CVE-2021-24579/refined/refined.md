{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The bt_bb_get_grid AJAX action in the Bold Page Builder plugin passes user input to the unserialize() function without proper validation or sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "PHP Object Injection",
    "Insecure Deserialization",
    "Lack of input validation",
    "Use of unserialize() with user-controlled data"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if other installed plugins on the blog provide a suitable gadget chain. In this specific example it leads to printing 'OBJECT INJECTED' and stopping the execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with the 'bt_bb_get_grid' action and a crafted serialized payload within the 'show' parameter. It requires knowledge of a valid nonce, which is stored within a Masonry Post Grid element on a page built using the plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to a page containing a Masonry Post Grid element to obtain the nonce. The AJAX callback function is accessible to unauthenticated users."
