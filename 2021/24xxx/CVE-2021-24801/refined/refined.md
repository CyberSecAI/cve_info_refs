The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24801.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks for its AJAX actions. Additionally, it does not sanitize the Survey's Title.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** AJAX actions can be called by any user, allowing unauthorized survey creation, editing, and deletion.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of sanitization in the Survey's Title allows for stored XSS injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized survey manipulation:** Any user (even unauthenticated) can create, modify, or delete surveys.
*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the survey title, which can be executed when a user views the survey. This allows attackers to perform actions like stealing cookies or redirecting the user.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **AJAX calls:** Sending crafted POST requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with specific action parameters (e.g., `createNewServey`, `deleteSurvey`).
*   **Lack of CSRF protection:** Attackers can trick a user into submitting the malicious form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site. No specific user role is required as the vulnerability is exploitable by any user, even unauthenticated ones.
