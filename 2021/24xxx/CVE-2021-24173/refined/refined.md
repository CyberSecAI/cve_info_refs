- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin "VM Backups" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - CSRF vulnerability: The plugin does not validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Attackers can modify plugin options by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability and inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed within the pluginâ€™s settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Attackers can perform unwanted actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
    - Attackers can inject malicious scripts, leading to XSS and potentially further compromise of the site.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - CSRF attacks: An attacker crafts a malicious request (e.g., a link or form) and tricks a logged-in user into submitting it.
    - XSS attacks: The malicious script is executed when a user accesses the affected plugin's settings page or other part of the site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an action. This can be done by sending the user a malicious link or embedding it in a malicious page.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs a logged-in user to interact with the crafted request.
