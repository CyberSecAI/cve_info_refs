Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24284:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `kaswara` WordPress plugin's insecure handling of file uploads via the `uploadFontIcon` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files.
*   **Lack of File Type Checks:** The plugin does not check the uploaded files for malicious content, such as PHP files.
*   **Insecure File Storage:** The uploaded ZIP files are extracted directly into the `wp-content/uploads/kaswara/fonts_icon` directory.
*  **Path Traversal:**  It is possible to upload files to other directories by using path traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can upload and execute malicious PHP files, potentially gaining full control of the WordPress website.
*   **Website Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to website defacement, data theft, malware distribution, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Specific Capabilities:** The attacker does not need any specific user privileges or prior knowledge of the site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only requires network access to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is known to be actively exploited.
*   The vendor is unresponsive.
*   The issue was confirmed in versions up to 2.3.1.
*   In version 3.x, while the `uploadFontIcon` action is not present, other actions can be used to achieve the same result.
*   The uploaded files are usually located in `/wp-content/uploads/kaswara/`, but can be placed in any location using path traversal.
