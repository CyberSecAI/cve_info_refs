- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `current_month_divider` parameter of the `mec_list_load_more` AJAX call before outputting it in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and output escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL. This can lead to various attacks like session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted URL that includes the malicious script in the `current_month_divider` parameter of an AJAX call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and lure a victim to click the link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
