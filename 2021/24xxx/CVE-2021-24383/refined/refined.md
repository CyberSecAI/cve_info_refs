The provided content relates to CVE-2021-24383.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "WP Google Maps" failed to sanitize, validate, or escape the "Map Name" input when displayed in the admin dashboard's Map List.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Map Name" field. This code will be executed in the browser of any authenticated user who views the Map List in the admin dashboard, potentially leading to:
  - Account compromise via cookie theft/session hijacking.
  - Redirection to malicious websites.
  - Defacement of the admin panel.
  - Other malicious actions on the targeted WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
  - An attacker with administrative privileges or the ability to edit maps within the WordPress admin panel can inject the malicious payload through the "Map Name" field.
  - The stored XSS payload is triggered when an admin views the Map List page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with sufficient privileges to edit maps in the WordPress admin panel.
