  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks in some AJAX actions, which allows any authenticated user to call them. This, combined with a lack of output escaping, leads to stored XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Missing authorization checks on AJAX actions",
    "Missing CSRF protection on AJAX actions",
    "Lack of output escaping leading to stored XSS"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed in the admin dashboard, potentially leading to admin account compromise or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user can send a crafted POST request to the admin-ajax.php endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site with at least Subscriber privileges to be able to send authenticated requests."
