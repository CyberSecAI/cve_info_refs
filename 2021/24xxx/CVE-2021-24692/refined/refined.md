{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin allows users to specify the downloadable file path, which is not properly sanitized, allowing path traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path Traversal (CWE-22)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with Contributor role can download arbitrary files from the web server, potentially including sensitive files like wp-config.php.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by adding a new download and setting the 'Downloadable File' to a path that uses traversal sequences (e.g., '../').",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role in WordPress and the ability to add new downloads via the plugin."
