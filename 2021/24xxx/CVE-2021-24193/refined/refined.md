{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The AJAX action `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` in multiple WP-Buy plugins lacks proper access control, allowing low-privileged users to install and activate arbitrary plugins.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Access Control",
     "Arbitrary plugin installation",
     "Arbitrary plugin activation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can install vulnerable plugins, potentially leading to more critical vulnerabilities like Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attackers can also activate installed plugins.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` using the vulnerable `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` action.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A low-privileged user account on the affected WordPress site is required. The attacker needs to be able to make POST requests with the correct parameters."
