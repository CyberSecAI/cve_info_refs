- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape the description setting when outputting it on the frontend when the "Coming Soon" mode is enabled. This occurs even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's description field. When a user accesses the frontend, this code will execute in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with the ability to modify the plugin's settings can inject malicious code through the description field. The XSS is triggered when other users access the frontend.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level privileges or the ability to modify the plugin's settings.
