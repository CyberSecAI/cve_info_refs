Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24273:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "Clever Addons for Elementor" plugin, before version 2.1.0, had multiple widgets ("Banner", "Multi Banner", and potentially "animated headlines") that did not properly sanitize user-provided HTML tag parameters. Specifically, the `title_tag` parameter in the "Banner" and "Multi Banner" widgets, and the `heading_tag` parameter in the "animated headlines" widget, were vulnerable.
*   While the element controls presented a fixed list of HTML tags, it was possible to bypass this on the server side and submit a 'save_builder' request containing arbitrary JavaScript within these tag parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript injected through the vulnerable parameters was stored in the database and executed when the affected page was viewed or previewed by any user.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin failed to properly sanitize the `title_tag` and `heading_tag` parameters on the server-side.
*  **Bypass of Client-Side Controls:** The client-side UI presented a limited selection of HTML tags but did not enforce this selection on the server-side, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML tags, including `<script>` tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session.
*   **Site Takeover:** If the victim was an administrator, the attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to perform privilege escalation, potentially leading to full site takeover.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or manipulate stored data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Request Manipulation:** An attacker could intercept or craft a 'save_builder' request to the server and modify the `title_tag` or `heading_tag` parameters to include JavaScript code.
*   **Elementor Editor:** The vulnerability is accessible to any user with access to the Elementor editor, including contributors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** An attacker needs at least a contributor-level account on the WordPress site.
*   **Elementor Editor Access:** The attacker must have access to the Elementor editor interface, which is typically granted to users with at least the contributor role.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** An attacker needs the ability to intercept or craft HTTP requests to modify the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of similar XSS vulnerabilities found in various Elementor addon plugins at the time.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.0 of the "Clever Addons for Elementor" plugin.
*   Wordfence firewall users were protected from this vulnerability since March 25, 2021.
