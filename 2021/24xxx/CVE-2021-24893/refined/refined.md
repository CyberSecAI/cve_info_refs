- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to validate the submitted rating, allowing for the submission of excessively large integer values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input validation on the "rating" parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This can manifest in the comments section failing to load properly for authenticated users due to memory exhaustion, or the pending comments dashboard becomes unusable for unauthenticated users.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to `/wp-comments-post.php` with an excessively large integer value for the "rating" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can be either authenticated or unauthenticated. They need the ability to send POST requests to the WordPress site.
