**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `tutor_quiz_builder_get_question_form` AJAX action in the Tutor LMS plugin was vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization and prepared statements when querying the database for quiz question data. The function uses user-supplied input (`question_id`) directly in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (UNION based):** The `question_id` parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in a database query, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries, using `UNION`, to extract data from the database.
- **Unprotected AJAX action:** The AJAX action is accessible to any authenticated user, including students, instead of being restricted to instructors or administrators.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other user data.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Depending on server configuration, attackers might be able to read or write files on the server, potentially leading to more severe compromises.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote exploitation via HTTP requests:** The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a crafted POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, with the `action` parameter set to `tutor_quiz_builder_get_question_form`, and a malicious `question_id` parameter in the request body.
- **Student Access:** Any authenticated student can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** An attacker must be logged in to the WordPress site, with any role (including a student role) being sufficient for exploitation.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable AJAX action (`tutor_quiz_builder_get_question_form`) and how to send the request.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.8.3 of the Tutor LMS plugin.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates exploitation with `sqlmap`.
- This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Chloe Chamberland from Wordfence.
- The same root cause is also behind other SQL injection vulnerabilities in the plugin, as described in the same report from wordfence.com.
