### Summary of Vulnerability
The provided content details an SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-24221) in the "Quiz And Survey Master" WordPress plugin, specifically in versions prior to 7.1.12.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `result_id` GET parameter within the `shortcode_display_result` function. This function is associated with the `[qsm_result]` shortcode. When the shortcode is used without an `id` attribute, the plugin directly concatenates the unsanitized `result_id` parameter into an SQL query, leading to an SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The direct use of unsanitized input (`result_id`) within an SQL query makes the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks. This is a classic case of CWE-89.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion of sensitive information.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An author-level user, being the lowest role that can use the shortcode, can exploit this vulnerability. An unauthenticated user could exploit it on a public page/post.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the `result_id` GET parameter in the URL to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Shortcode Placement:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `[qsm_result]` shortcode is used without an `id` attribute in posts or pages, which can be done by authors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Author Role or Public Access:** An attacker needs to be at least an author-level user within the WordPress site to embed the shortcode and manipulate the GET parameter. However, if the shortcode is embedded on a public page or post, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit the injection.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet from `class-qmn-quiz-manager.php`:
```php
public function shortcode_display_result($atts){
    extract(shortcode_atts(array(
        'id' => 0,
    ), $atts));
    ob_start();
    if($id == 0){
        $id = isset($_GET['result_id']) ? $_GET['result_id'] : 0;
    }
    global $wpdb;
    $result_data = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->prefix}mlw_results WHERE result_id = {$id}", ARRAY_A);
    ...
}
```

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.1.12 of the plugin.
- The CVSS score is 8.8 (High), indicating a severe risk.
- The plugin's code changes to address the vulnerability included sanitization of the `result_id` GET parameter by using `sanitize_text_field()`.
