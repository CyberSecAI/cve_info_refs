- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when performing file upload and deletion actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - CSRF vulnerability: Missing CSRF checks allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in administrator.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Arbitrary file upload: An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP files) to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
  - Arbitrary file deletion: An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially disrupting the website's functionality or deleting critical files.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Exploitation is via a CSRF attack. An attacker crafts a malicious request (HTML form or JavaScript code) that, when triggered by a logged-in administrator, executes the file upload or deletion without the administrator's awareness or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into triggering the crafted CSRF request by clicking a link or visiting a website controlled by the attacker.
  - The attacker does not need to have any prior authentication to the vulnerable site; they only need an admin user to trigger their malicious request.
