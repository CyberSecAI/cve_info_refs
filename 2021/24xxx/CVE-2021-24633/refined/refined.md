- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `eb_write_block_css` AJAX action in the Countdown Block plugin lacks proper authorization, allowing any authenticated user to modify post content. Additionally, a previous attempt to fix the issue was incomplete, leaving it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Missing authorization in the `eb_write_block_css` AJAX action.
    - Incomplete fix leading to CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify the content of posts displayed to users. In the provided example, they can inject arbitrary content before paragraphs of a post.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - By sending a crafted AJAX request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `eb_write_block_css` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (even a low-privileged user like a subscriber) on the WordPress site. The attacker also requires the ability to execute javascript on the victim's browser.
