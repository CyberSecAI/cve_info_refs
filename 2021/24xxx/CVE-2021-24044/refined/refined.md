- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Passing invalid JavaScript code where `await` and `yield` are called upon non-async and non-generator getter/setter functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion error leading to a segmentation fault.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Segmentation fault with a low chance of Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors**: Passing crafted/invalid JavaScript code to Hermes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to execute Javascript code using the Hermes Javascript engine.
