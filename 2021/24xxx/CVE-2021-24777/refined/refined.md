- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sub_id` parameter in the `view_form_sub_id` functionality is not sanitized, escaped, or validated before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability (SQLI).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, modifying data, or compromising the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious GET request to the `admin.php` page with a crafted `sub_id` parameter, specifically when viewing submissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
