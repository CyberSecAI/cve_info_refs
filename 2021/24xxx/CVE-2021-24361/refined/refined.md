Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization and validation of several POST parameters within the `gd_popular_location_list` AJAX action of the GeoDirectory Location Manager plugin. These unsanitized parameters are then directly used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of sanitization:
    *   The `order_by` parameter is vulnerable, allowing arbitrary SQL injection.
    *   The `country_non_restricted`, `region_non_restricted`, and `city_non_restricted` parameters are also susceptible to SQL injection.
    *   The `what` parameter, used in the `GROUP BY` clause, is vulnerable to error-based SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database using blind SQL injection techniques. This includes potentially accessing user credentials, site configurations, and other confidential information.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can be a stepping stone for further malicious activities, such as privilege escalation, data manipulation, and complete site compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Endpoint:** The primary attack vector is the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, which is used by the `gd_popular_location_list` action.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerable parameters are sent via HTTP POST requests to the AJAX endpoint.
*   **Specific Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are: `order_by`, `country_non_restricted`, `region_non_restricted`, `city_non_restricted`, and `what`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning an attacker does not need any login credentials to exploit it.
*   **Access to AJAX Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameters (`order_by`, `country_non_restricted`, `region_non_restricted`, `city_non_restricted`, and `what`) and how to exploit them.
*   **Valid `_nonce` value:** A valid `_nonce` parameter and `wpinv_session_*` cookie are needed, which are generated by a page including the file `/wp-content/plugins/geodir_location_manager/includes/widget-functions.php`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content indicates that a fix was implemented in version 2.1.0.10 of the GeoDirectory Location Manager plugin.
*   The CVSS score is 9.0 (Critical), highlighting the severity of the vulnerability.
