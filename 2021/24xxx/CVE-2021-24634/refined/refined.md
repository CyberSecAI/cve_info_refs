- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape some of the properties of the Recipe Card Block, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied data in the `Recipe Card Block` properties, such as `ingredientsLayout`, `iconSet`, `steps`, `ingredients`, `recipeTitle`, or `settings`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or malware distribution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a contributor or higher-level user adds malicious code in the Recipe Card Block properties in the code editor, and the page/post containing the block is viewed/previewed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to a WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin. They need to be able to create or edit posts/pages using the code editor.
