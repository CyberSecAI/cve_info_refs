### CVE-2021-24339

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Pods WordPress plugin failed to properly validate user input in the 'Menu Label' field parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Menu Label' field. When a user views the affected page (likely in the admin interface), the malicious script will execute in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker must have authenticated access to the WordPress admin panel and be able to modify the 'Menu Label' field, which is related to custom content types within the Pods plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with sufficient privileges to modify the 'Menu Label' within the Pods plugin settings.  The CVSS score indicates "Privileges Required (PR): High", but some sources list it as "Low", potentially due to different interpretations of "high privileges" needed to access the vulnerable field. The attacker needs to navigate to the Pods admin page, specifically when creating or editing a 'Custom Setting Page'.
