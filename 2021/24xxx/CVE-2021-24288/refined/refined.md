- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "redirect" parameter in the AcyMailing subscription process is not properly sanitized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open Redirect. The application does not validate the redirect URL, allowing an attacker to control the destination URL after a successful subscription.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious link and send it to a victim. Upon clicking the link, the victim will be redirected to a potentially malicious website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a link with a malicious URL in the `redirect` parameter of a subscription request and sends it to the victim. The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks this specially crafted link. By changing the POST request into a GET request and adding parameters as GET parameters, the attacker can bypass redirection configurations and control the landing page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious redirect parameter and send it to a potential victim. No authentication or special privileges are required.
