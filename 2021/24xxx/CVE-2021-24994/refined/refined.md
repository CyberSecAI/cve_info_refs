{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize or escape a parameter from unauthenticated requests when adding remote storage before outputting it on the admin page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the admin page, which can lead to various malicious activities when an administrator visits the affected page. This includes potential session hijacking, data theft, or further compromise of the WordPress site.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending an unauthenticated request to specific plugin actions (e.g., `wpvivid_one_drive_finish_auth`, `wpvivid_google_drive_finish_auth`) with a crafted `name` parameter containing malicious JavaScript. The XSS is triggered when an administrator accesses the plugin's settings page in the WordPress admin panel.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability and can send arbitrary HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. The attacker needs no special access."
