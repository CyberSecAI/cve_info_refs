```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin allows path traversal and local file inclusion due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input when setting the Layout for a Cost Calculator post.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path Traversal",
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local PHP files from the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote code execution if the included file contains executable code.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user with Contributor or higher privileges (depending on the plugin version) can create a Cost Calculator post and specify a malicious file path in the Layout field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor privileges for versions < 1.5 and Admin+ for versions <= 1.8."
