- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize image metadata (specifically the title) before outputting it in the generated gallery.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with editor or higher privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the image title. This code will then be executed in the browsers of users who view the gallery, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin's image metadata handling. Specifically by adding or editing a gallery image title field, injecting malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least editor-level privileges in WordPress, allowing them to add or edit image metadata.
