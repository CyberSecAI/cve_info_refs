Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The WP Image Zoom plugin fails to validate the `tab` parameter before using it in an `include_once()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The lack of sanitization of the `tab` parameter allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files via the `include_once()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information by including arbitrary files on the server, if they have access to the vulnerable url.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP request to the WordPress admin dashboard.
- The vulnerable endpoint is: `wp-admin/admin.php?page=zoooom_settings&tab=whatever`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress admin dashboard.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. (This is implied since the CVSS score indicates an unauthenticated attack vector).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of the WP Image Zoom plugin prior to 1.47.
- The provided PoC URL demonstrates the vulnerability, resulting in an `include_once` error, which shows the parameter is not sanitized.
- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 4.3.
