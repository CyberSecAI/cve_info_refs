### Summary of CVE-2021-24358

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to the plugin not properly validating a redirect parameter in a crafted URL, which allows an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Open Redirect:** The plugin's password reset functionality, specifically the `redirect_to_tp_custom_password_reset` function, does not validate the `redirecturl` parameter, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked by a user, redirects them to a website of the attacker's choice. This can be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted URL with a malicious `redirecturl` parameter is used to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to craft a URL with a malicious redirect parameter.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the website.
- The user needs to click on the crafted link to be redirected.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `redirect_to_tp_custom_password_reset` function within the `theplus_elementor_addon/includes/plus_addon.php` file.
- The vulnerable URL format is: `https://example.com/wp-login.php?action=theplusrp&key=&redirecturl=http://attacker.com&forgoturl=http://attacker.com&login=john`
- A registered user on WordPress (e.g., John) who clicks this link will be redirected to `http://attacker.com`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as an Open Redirect (CWE-601)
- The CVSS score is 4.3 (Medium).
- The issue was reported by Nicolas Vidal from TEHTRIS.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.1.10 of the plugin.
