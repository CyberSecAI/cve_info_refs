  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin allows high privilege users to download arbitrary files from the web server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path traversal vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with admin privileges can download arbitrary files from the web server, potentially exposing sensitive information like configuration files or source code.",
