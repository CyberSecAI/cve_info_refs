## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Duplicate Page < 4.4.3 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or escape the Duplicate Post Suffix settings before outputting it, which could allow high privilege users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

The attempt to fix the issue in 4.4.2 is insufficient and still allows for XSS.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the Duplicate Post Suffix setting of the plugin:
- v < 4.4.2: "><svg/onload=confirm(/XSS/)>
- v < 4.4.3: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
