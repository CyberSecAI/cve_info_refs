- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape the "Duplicate Post Suffix" setting before outputting it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The attempt to fix the issue in version 4.4.2 was insufficient, leaving a vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A high-privilege user can inject malicious scripts that are then executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected settings page. This could lead to unauthorized actions, information theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: By entering a malicious payload within the "Duplicate Post Suffix" setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges (or other high-privilege user role) to access and modify the plugin's settings.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by providing specific proof-of-concept payloads and highlighting that the fix in 4.4.2 was inadequate.
