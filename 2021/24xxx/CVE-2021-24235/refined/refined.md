- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The theme does not sanitize the `keywords` and `start_date` GET parameters on its Tour List page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with specific payloads within the `keywords` and `start_date` GET parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and simply needs to craft and distribute the malicious URL. The victim needs to click on the link for the attack to be successful.
