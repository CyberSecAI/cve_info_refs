## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Download Monitor < 3.9.6 - Unauthenticated Log Access

### Description

The plugin saves logs in a predictable location, and does not have any authentication or authorisation in place to prevent unauthenticated users to download and read the logs containing Sensitive Information such as IP Addresses and Usernames

### Proof of Concept

https://example.com/wp-content/plugins/simple-download-monitor/sdm-download-logs.csv
Note: if the file is not created yet, then the admin has to export logs first, then anyone can download the log. Exporting can also be done via the separate CSRF.
