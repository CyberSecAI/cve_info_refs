- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `mediamaticAjaxRenameCategory` AJAX action in the Mediamatic plugin does not sanitize the `categoryID` parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=mediamaticAjaxRenameCategory` and a malicious payload in the `categoryID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (at least a subscriber) of the WordPress site.
