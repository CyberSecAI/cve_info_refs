- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to validate and escape user input passed to the `today_traffic_index` AJAX action before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `today_traffic_index` and a malicious payload in the `start` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level privileges.
