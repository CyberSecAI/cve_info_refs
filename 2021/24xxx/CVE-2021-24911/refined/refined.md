- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `tk0` parameter from the `tp_translation` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The XSS will trigger in the admin dashboard of the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=tp_translation` and a malicious payload in the `tk0` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the minimum role allowed to translate, which depends on the "Who can translate ?" setting of the plugin.
