{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Support Board plugin's `delete-file` function in `include/ajax.php` lacks CSRF protection and improper input validation on the `path` parameter, allowing arbitrary file deletion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CSRF vulnerability: The plugin does not have any CSRF checks in actions handled by the `include/ajax.php` file.",
      "Improper input validation: The `delete-file` function only checks if the path contains 'http' to decide whether to delete files within the /uploads directory, but does not sanitize or validate the path, allowing arbitrary file deletion outside of it."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage a CSRF attack to trick a logged-in administrator into deleting arbitrary files on the server, which can lead to loss of data or potentially remote code execution by deleting the wp-config.php file, leading to a reinstallation of wordpress where the attacker can create a new administrator account.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted POST request to the `include/ajax.php` file with `function=delete-file` and a `path` parameter specifying the file to be deleted.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint."
