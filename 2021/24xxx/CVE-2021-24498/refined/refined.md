- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize or escape the 'start' and 'end' GET parameters before outputting them in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a webpage that will be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or defacing the webpage.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with the 'start' and 'end' GET parameters containing malicious javascript. The vulnerability can be exploited by making an unsuspecting user click on the crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameters. No special privileges or access is required. The attacker must get a user to click on the crafted URL.
