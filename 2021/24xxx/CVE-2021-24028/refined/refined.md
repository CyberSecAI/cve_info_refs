Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24028

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of duplicate union data within the table-based serializer in Facebook's Thrift library. Specifically, when the input data contained multiple entries for the same union, the previous active member was overwritten without properly calling its destructor, which could lead to a memory leak and potentially other issues. Additionally, incomplete data during the deserialization process could lead to incorrect destructors being called during stack unwinding, resulting in a segfault, data corruption, or other undesirable effects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper destructor handling: Overwriting union members without invoking destructors for the previous active members leads to memory leaks.
- Incorrect destructor call during stack unwinding: Incomplete data during deserialization results in incorrect destructor calls during stack unwinding, leading to potential crashes or data corruption.
- Incorrect type for active field ID: The code used `FieldID` instead of `int` for storing the active field ID of a union.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory leaks: If an attacker sends specially crafted messages with duplicate union data, the server could experience memory leaks which could lead to denial of service or other impacts
- Segfault/Crash: Incomplete or malformed messages during deserialization process could lead to incorrect destructor calls, causing the application to crash.
- Data corruption: Incorrect destructor calls or improper handling of union data could lead to data corruption within the application's memory space.
- Undesirable effects: This is a broad category that could potentially include other issues caused by memory corruption, and in theory under certain circumstances, code execution cannot be completely ruled out

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by providing specially crafted or malformed serialized data to the Thrift table-based serializer. The malformed input should include:
- Duplicate union data: Including multiple entries for the same union in a message.
- Incomplete data: Providing a partially specified union field with a missing value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to a service/application using the vulnerable version of Facebook's Thrift library.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit fixes the issue by clearing the union if an active member already exists and changing the type of the active field id.
- The vulnerability affects Facebook Thrift versions prior to v2021.02.22.00.
- The vulnerability was identified and fixed internally by Facebook.
