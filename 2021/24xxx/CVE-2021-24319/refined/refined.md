- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Bello theme does not properly sanitize the `post_excerpt` parameter before outputting it on the `shop/my-account/bello-listing-endpoint/` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of the `post_excerpt` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/main-demo/shop/my-account/bello-listing-endpoint/` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `post_excerpt` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to be able to access the vulnerable page and submit the crafted POST request.
