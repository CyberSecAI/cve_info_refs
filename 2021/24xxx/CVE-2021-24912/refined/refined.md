- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `tp_translation` AJAX action in the Transposh WordPress Translation plugin lacks CSRF protection. Additionally, the `tk0` parameter within this action is not sanitized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the absence of CSRF checks.
  - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of the `tk0` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in user, including an administrator, to add malicious translations containing JavaScript code. This code is then executed within the context of the logged-in administrator when the translation is viewed, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious form and tricks an authorized user into submitting it, which exploits the CSRF vulnerability to inject the malicious XSS payload into the plugin's translation data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user, including an administrator, to submit a crafted HTTP request. The attacker does not require any specific access to the WordPress site.
