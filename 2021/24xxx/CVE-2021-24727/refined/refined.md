Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24727:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `order` and `orderby` GET parameters within several admin dashboard pages of the "Block and Stop Bad Bots" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin doesn't adequately sanitize these parameters before using them in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The core vulnerability is an SQL injection. Malicious SQL code can be injected via the `order` and `orderby` GET parameters, which are then processed in an unsafe manner, directly affecting the database.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to adequately validate or escape the `order` and `orderby` parameters before using them in SQL queries. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could use the SQL injection vulnerability to read, modify, or delete data in the WordPress database.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** With sufficient SQL injection control, an attacker might be able to elevate privileges or gain control of the entire WordPress site.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL queries that reveal usernames, passwords, email addresses, or other data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameters:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `order` and `orderby` parameters in HTTP GET requests to specific admin pages of the WordPress plugin.
    *   `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sbb_my-custom-submenu-page&orderby=[SQL_INJECTION]&order=asc`
    *   `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sbb_my-custom-submenu-page2&orderby=[SQL_INJECTION]&order=asc`
    *   `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sbb_my-custom-submenu-page3&orderby=[SQL_INJECTION]&order=asc`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the WordPress admin dashboard. The provided CVSS score indicates "High" privileges are required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site to send malicious HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable admin pages.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to know how to craft SQL injection payloads to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** The vulnerability affects the "Block and Stop Bad Bots" WordPress plugin before version 6.60.
*   **Affected Pages:** Specific admin pages are vulnerable: `sbb_my-custom-submenu-page`, `sbb_my-custom-submenu-page2`, and `sbb_my-custom-submenu-page3`.
*   **Specific Parameters:** The `orderby` and `order` parameters are the injection points.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 6.60 by sanitizing the `order` and `orderby` parameters, and also by introducing length limits to prevent overly long injected code.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.8, classified as "Medium" severity.
