## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Comments - wpDiscuz < 7.3.2 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitise or escape the Follow and Unfollow messages before outputting them in the page, which could allow high privilege users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

Timeline:

May 18th, 2021 - Vendor contacted by email, not a security issue according to them but will filter in the next update.

September 7th, 2021 - v7.3.0 released, issue still present

September 13th, 2021 - Escalated to WP Plugins Team & Public Disclosure. v7.3.1 released, issue still present.

September 19th, 2021 - v7.3.2 released, fixing the issue when settings are saved again (so any existing payloads will still work until settings are saved with this new version installed)

### Proof of Concept

Ad admin, put the following payload in the wpDiscuz > Phrases > Follow > "You started following this comment author" or "You stopped following this comment author" fields: </div><script>alert('XSS')</script>
Save the changes, log on with a user, go to a post with a comment from another user, and click the Follow/Unfollow icon (under a user comment profile picture) to trigger the XSS
