- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LearnPress plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape user inputs within course settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high privilege user (Admin+) can inject malicious JavaScript code into various course settings fields. This code will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding new courses, an attacker can inject XSS payloads into the following fields in the Course Settings:
    - General > External Link field
    - Extra Information > Requirements field
    - Extra Information > Target Audience field
    - Extra Information > Key Features field
    - Extra Information > FAQ Title field
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have Admin+ privileges to create or modify courses. The `unfiltered_html` capability must be disallowed for the XSS to be triggered.
