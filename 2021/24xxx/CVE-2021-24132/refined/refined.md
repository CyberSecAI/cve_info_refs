- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin's `bulk_action`, `export_full`, and `save_slider_db` functionalities did not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `WDW_S_Library::get`, `export_full`, and `save_slider_db` functions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP POST requests to specific admin pages with crafted parameters (e.g., `check[]`, `slider_ids_string`, `del_slide_ids_string`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a high-privileged user (Admin) or a medium-privileged user (Contributor+) with "Role Options" enabled.
