Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin does not sanitize or escape the 'sccp_id' parameter before using it in a SQL query. This lack of input sanitization leads to a SQL injection vulnerability.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - SQL Injection (SQLI)
    - Unauthenticated vulnerability: The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users.

Impact of exploitation:
    - An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.

Attack vectors:
    - The vulnerability is triggered via the 'ays_sccp_results_export_file' AJAX action by sending a crafted request with a malicious 'sccp_id' parameter.
    - The vulnerable endpoint is: /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php

Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
    - The attacker can be remote.
