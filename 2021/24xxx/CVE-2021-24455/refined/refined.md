- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly escape the Summary field of Announcements when outputting it in an attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the Announcement summary, which will be executed when a user views the Announcements list. This can lead to privilege escalation if an administrator views the crafted announcement.
- **Attack vectors**: A user with the "Tutor Instructor" role can create an Announcement with a malicious payload in the Summary field. When the Announcements list is viewed by any user, the XSS payload is triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least the "Tutor Instructor" role.
