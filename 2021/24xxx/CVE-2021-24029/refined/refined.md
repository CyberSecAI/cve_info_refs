Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24029:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of a specially crafted message during a QUIC session. Instead of treating the message as a connection error, the code leads to a failed assertion, causing a crash. The core issue is the lack of a proper check or handling mechanism for duplicate 1-rtt write ciphers during the QUIC handshake.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Error Handling:** The code fails to properly handle a scenario where a duplicate 1-rtt write cipher is derived. According to the QUIC specification, this scenario should result in a connection error but instead triggers a crash through a failed assertion.
*   **Assertion Failure:** The vulnerability exposes a flaw in the state machine's logic where an unexpected condition (duplicate cipher) results in an assertion failure rather than a graceful termination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted message can cause a server crash, effectively leading to a denial-of-service condition. This is described as a "packet of death scenario" in the advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted QUIC message during the handshake process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send QUIC messages to a vulnerable server.
*   **Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker would require some knowledge of the QUIC protocol to craft the specific message that exploits the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `mvfst` versions prior to commit `a67083ff4b8dcbb7ee2839da6338032030d712b0` and `proxygen` versions prior to `v2021.03.15.00`.
*   The fix involves adding a check to prevent the derivation of duplicate ciphers and closing the connection with a crypto error if a duplicate is detected. This addresses the incorrect behavior that was leading to the assertion failure.
* The commit message references the CVE and the fix implemented.

**Code Changes:**

The fix involves modifications to `quic/server/state/ServerStateMachine.cpp` and `quic/server/test/QuicServerTransportTest.cpp`.

*   In `ServerStateMachine.cpp`, a check was added to ensure that a duplicate 1-rtt write cipher is not derived. If a duplicate cipher is detected, a `QuicTransportException` is thrown.
*   In `QuicServerTransportTest.cpp`, a new test case `DuplicateOneRttWriteCipher` was added to verify that the server closes the connection when a duplicate cipher is derived and it throws the expected "Crypto error"
