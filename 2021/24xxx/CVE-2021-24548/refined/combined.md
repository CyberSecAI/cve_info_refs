## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Mimetic Books <= 0.2.13 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin was vulnerable to Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the "Default Publisher ID" field on the plugin's settings page.

### Proof of Concept

1. Install WordPress 5.7.2
2. Install and activate Mimetic Books
3. Navigate to Settings >> Mimetic Books API and enter the XSS payload into the Default Publisher ID input field.
4. Click Save Changes.
5. You will observe that the payload successfully got stored into the database and when you are triggering the same functionality at that time JavaScript payload is executing successfully and we are getting a pop-up.
6. Payload Used: "><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
