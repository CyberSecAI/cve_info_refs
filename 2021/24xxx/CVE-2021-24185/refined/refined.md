Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and the absence of prepared statements in the `tutor_place_rating` function of the Tutor LMS plugin. Specifically, the `course_id` parameter, which is user-supplied via a POST request to the `wp_ajax_tutor_place_rating` AJAX action, is directly used in a SQL query without being sanitized or prepared.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (Blind/Time-Based):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. Because the `course_id` parameter is not properly handled before being used in a SQL query, attackers can inject arbitrary SQL code, allowing them to retrieve information from the database. This injection can be exploited using both blind-based and time-based techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data stored in the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other potentially sensitive information.
*   **Database Manipulation:** In some cases where the MySQL server is insecurely configured, an attacker could potentially read and create files on the server as well as modify data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: While not directly related to this specific vulnerability, other vulnerabilities in the plugin allowed for privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Action:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, targeting the `tutor_place_rating` action.
*   **User-Supplied Input:** The `course_id` parameter in the POST request is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, with student role. It is easy to register as a student on sites using the Tutor LMS plugin.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is within the `tutor_place_rating` function, specifically the database query using `$wpdb->get_var()` to check for existing reviews.
*   The lack of sanitization on the `$course_id` variable before using it in the SQL query is the root of the problem.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using SQL injection techniques such as blind-based and time-based injections. The proof of concept uses the sqlmap tool for blind injection.
*   The vulnerability is present in Tutor LMS versions prior to 1.7.7.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Wordfence and patched in version 1.7.7 of the Tutor LMS plugin.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.5, which is categorized as Medium severity.

This vulnerability is one of several SQL injection and other vulnerabilities patched in Tutor LMS versions < 1.8.3.
