- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `blog2social` WordPress plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `b2sShowByDate` parameter before outputting it in an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable page. This can lead to various attacks, including stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter that is then accessed by a victim user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the `b2sShowByDate` parameter containing the XSS payload and trick a logged in user into clicking the link.
