- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize its setting fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings. This code will be stored and executed every time an administrator accesses the plugin's settings page.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator privileges to access the plugin's settings page. The malicious payload is injected through the plugin settings, specifically into the text field "Choose overlay color" or any other text fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in with administrator privileges.
