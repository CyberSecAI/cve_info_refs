Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24591:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Highlight" fails to sanitize the user-supplied CustomCSS setting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin allows high-privilege users to inject malicious JavaScript code through the CustomCSS setting. This code is then stored in the database and executed when other users visit the affected pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Stealing cookies and session data
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with high privileges (e.g., administrator) can inject the malicious payload through the plugin's CustomCSS setting. The XSS will be triggered when a user visits a page where the Custom CSS is being used

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, capable of modifying the plugin settings.
