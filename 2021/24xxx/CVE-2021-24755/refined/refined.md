- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate or escape the `fields` parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request with a malicious `fields` parameter to the vulnerable endpoints: `users.php?page=mycred_default-history` or `admin.php?page=mycred`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any authenticated user, including a subscriber, can exploit the vulnerability.
