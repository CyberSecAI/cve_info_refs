Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the plugin's failure to properly escape attributes within its shortcodes. This allows malicious code to be injected via these attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected content (where the shortcode is present).
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape the input provided to shortcode attributes, thus failing to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that can be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the crafted shortcode is rendered.
- **Account Takeover:** This could lead to session hijacking, account takeover, or other malicious activities if the victim is an administrator or has elevated privileges.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers could steal cookies or sensitive information if XSS is used to access the user's context.
- **Redirection and Phishing:** Malicious JavaScript can redirect users to phishing sites or execute other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the shortcode attributes using the plugin's shortcode feature.
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious shortcode is stored, and when rendered to the user, the script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Contributor+ Role:** An attacker needs at least a Contributor role on the WordPress site. This allows them to create and edit posts/pages where they can insert the crafted shortcode.
- **Ability to create/edit content:** The attacker needs the ability to insert shortcodes via post or page creation/editing within the WordPress admin interface.
