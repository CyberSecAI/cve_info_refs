- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize, escape, or validate the `date_answers[]` POST parameter before using it in a SQL statement when processing a poll result.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform SQL Injection attacks which can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The CVSS score indicates a critical severity, with high confidentiality impact and low integrity impact.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=pollinsertvalues` with malicious SQL code in the `date_answers[]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely via HTTP requests. The provided proof of concept shows the injection is done through the `date_answers[0]` POST parameter. The attacker needs to send unique values for the `X-Forwarded-For` header when testing the injection.
