- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape the "Amount Menu Name" field of created buttons.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the victim's browser when editing a button, leading to potential unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high privilege user (Admin+), who can create or edit buttons. They inject a malicious payload into the "Amount Menu Name" field of a button. The XSS payload is then triggered when a user edits the affected button.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator or a user with a higher privilege who has the ability to create or edit buttons within the WordPress plugin.
