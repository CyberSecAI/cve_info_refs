Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the "Bulk Datetime Change" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not enforce capability checks, allowing users with the "Contributor" role (which typically has limited privileges) to perform actions they should not be able to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to its functionalities based on user roles and capabilities. This is a classic example of broken access control.
*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The plugin uses `edit_posts` capability checks, which allow contributors to edit their own posts, when it should use `publish_posts` capability checks, which allows users to edit and publish all posts, irrespective of who wrote the post. The plugin should also check for `manage_options` for accessing settings pages
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows lower-privileged users to list the titles of private posts from other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Modification of Data:**  Attackers can change the published date of posts belonging to other users.
*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can list private post titles from other users.
*   **Potential for Abuse:** By exploiting the ability to modify post dates, an attacker could potentially manipulate content timelines and make it difficult for site administrators to track changes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Interaction with Plugin:**  The vulnerability is exploited through direct interaction with the plugin's functionality, specifically the "Bulk Datetime Change" page in the WordPress admin panel.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:**  The provided proof of concept shows that a user can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the plugin's endpoint (`admin.php?page=bulkdatetimechange`) to perform unauthorized actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:**  The attacker needs a WordPress user account with at least a "Contributor" role, meaning that the user has limited privileges by default.
*   **Access to WordPress Admin Panel:**  The attacker needs to have access to the WordPress admin panel to reach the vulnerable plugin page.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint**: The attacker needs to know the admin panel URL for the plugin.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by apple502j.
*   The fix was implemented in version 1.12 of the plugin. The fix is based around changes to capabilities, and not filtering out posts based on authorship.
*   The vulnerability is classified as an "Access Control" issue, specifically CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).

In summary, CVE-2021-24842 highlights a broken access control vulnerability in the "Bulk Datetime Change" plugin that allows low-privileged users to access and modify data they shouldn't have access to.
