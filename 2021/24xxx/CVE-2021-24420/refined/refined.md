The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24420.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin did not sanitize and escape some of its quote fields when adding/editing a quote as admin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied data before outputting it in the "All Quotes" table.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the quote fields. When an administrator views the "All Quotes" list, the malicious JavaScript will be executed in their browser. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the plugin's administration interface. An administrator can be tricked into adding/editing a quote containing the malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have administrator privileges within the WordPress installation to add or edit quotes. Additionally, the `UNFILTERED_HTML` capability must be disallowed for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerable fields include "First Name", "Last Name", "Address", "City", and "Additional Details".
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.3.4 of the plugin.
*   The plugin is "request-a-quote".
