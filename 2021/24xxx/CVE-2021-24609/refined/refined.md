Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied settings before outputting them in HTML attributes. Specifically, the "Maps > Zona" setting fields are vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of sanitization allows malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when the settings are rendered in a web page.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page. An attacker with high privileges (e.g., administrator) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (like an administrator) within the WordPress site to access the vulnerable settings page and modify the map zone settings.

The provided proof-of-concept is:
`"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`

This payload injected into a map's zone setting field will trigger an alert box with the text XSS, demonstrating successful execution of the injected script when the page displaying the map zone settings is rendered.

The vulnerability is present in versions of "WP Mapa Politico Espana" prior to 3.7.0 and was fixed in version 3.7.0
