## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Display Post Metadata < 1.5.0 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin adds a shortcode to print out custom fields, however their content is not sanitised or escaped which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

- Login as contributor+
- Create a custom field containing XSS payload (eg. <script>alert(1)</script>)
- Add this shortcode to the post/page: [metadata element="custom\_fields"]
- The XSS will be triggered when the post/page is previewed/viewed by any user

### Affects Plugins
