- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's shortcode for displaying custom fields does not sanitize or escape the content of those fields before rendering them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into custom fields. When a page containing the vulnerable shortcode is viewed by a user, the malicious script will be executed in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform other actions on the user's behalf.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with Contributor or higher privileges can create or edit custom fields containing malicious JavaScript. The injected code is then triggered when the shortcode `[metadata element="custom_fields"]` is used in a post/page and viewed by any user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor level access to WordPress to create or modify posts and custom fields.
