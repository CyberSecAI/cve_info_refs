Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24501:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content from `wpscan.com` directly references CVE-2021-24501, confirming its relevance.
   - The description on wpscan.com aligns with the general concept of missing authorization checks, which is consistent with the information.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    - The root cause is the lack of authorization checks in multiple AJAX actions within the Workreap theme, allowing users to perform actions (modifying or deleting objects) that should be restricted to specific users or roles.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - **Missing Authorization Checks:** AJAX actions did not verify if a user was authorized to perform specific operations, leading to broken access control.
    -  Specifically the vulnerability allowed a logged in user to modify or delete objects belonging to other users.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - A logged-in attacker (even with low privileges) could modify or delete objects belonging to other users.
    - This could lead to data loss, disruption of service, and other malicious activities within the WordPress site.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector is via AJAX requests sent to vulnerable endpoints within the Workreap theme.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site.
    - No specific roles or privileges are required, a basic user account is sufficient.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The content from `jetpack.com` focuses on a different vulnerability (CVE-2021-24499) related to unauthenticated file uploads within the same theme, this is separate from the broken access control vulnerability.
   - The `wpscan.com` provides a proof-of-concept example using `curl` to demonstrate the vulnerability, showing how an attacker can delete arbitrary portfolio items of other users by exploiting the `workreap_portfolio_remove` AJAX action.
   - The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.2 of the Workreap theme.
   - CVSS score: 7.1 (High)
   - CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
   - OWASP A5: Broken Access Control

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-24501 is a broken access control vulnerability in the Workreap WordPress theme, stemming from missing authorization checks in AJAX actions. This allows low-privileged, logged-in users to modify or delete objects belonging to other users. This vulnerability can lead to information alteration, data loss and disruption of service.
