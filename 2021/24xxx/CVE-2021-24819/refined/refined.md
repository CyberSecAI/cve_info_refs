Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The plugin lacks proper authorization checks when displaying content via shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin does not properly restrict access to content based on user roles, specifically when using the `[post-content-sc]` and `[page-content-sc]` shortcodes. This allows users with the "contributor" role and higher to access posts/pages they should not have access to.
*   **Insufficient authorization:** Users with contributor roles can access draft, private, password-protected, and trashed posts/pages, including content created by other users such as admins and editors.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized content access:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive content they should not be able to view, including draft, private and password-protected posts and pages.
*   **Information disclosure:** An attacker can view potentially confidential data from posts/pages.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Shortcode injection:** Attackers inject the vulnerable shortcodes, `[post-content-sc id="ID"]` or `[page-content-sc id="ID"]`, into a page or post they have access to.
*   **Preview:**  The attacker previews the page/post to trigger the vulnerable code and display the content of the target post/page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **WordPress user account:** The attacker needs a user account with at least the "contributor" role.
*   **Knowledge of post/page IDs:** The attacker needs to know the ID of the post or page they wish to access.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `pagepost-content-shortcode` plugin version 1.0 and below.
*   No known fix exists for the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is classified as an access control issue (CWE-284) and is mapped to the OWASP Top 10 "A5: Broken Access Control".
*   The CVSS score is 4.3, indicating a medium severity.
