## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Photo Gallery < 1.5.67 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Gallery Title

### Description

The plugin did not properly sanitise the gallery title, allowing high privilege users to create one with XSS payload in it, which will be triggered when another user will view the gallery list or the affected gallery in the admin dashboard. This is due to an incomplete fix of CVE-2019-16117

### Proof of Concept

Create or edit a gallery and use the below payload as the gallery title " style="animation-name:rotation" onanimationstart="alert(/XSS/)

### Affects Plugins
