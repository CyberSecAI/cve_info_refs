- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin did not properly sanitize the gallery title, allowing high privilege users to inject XSS payloads. This was due to an incomplete fix of a previous vulnerability (CVE-2019-16117).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., administrator) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the gallery title. This code is then executed in the browsers of other users who view the gallery list or the affected gallery within the admin dashboard, potentially leading to arbitrary actions performed on their behalf.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's interface for creating or editing a photo gallery, specifically the title field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have high-level privileges, such as administrator, within the WordPress site to create or edit photo galleries.
