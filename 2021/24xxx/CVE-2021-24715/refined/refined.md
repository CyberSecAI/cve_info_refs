- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** High privilege users can perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious payloads into specific plugin settings fields:
    - "How to display the posts" (backend XSS, v < 1.6.5)
    - "How to display the posts" (frontend XSS, v < 1.6.6)
    - "Exclude pages" (backend XSS, v < 1.7.0)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have Admin+ privileges to access and modify the plugin settings.
