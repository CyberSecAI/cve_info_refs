- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF protection when saving the 'Default Text to Display if no tips' setting and also lacks sanitization and escaping of this setting before outputting it to the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into saving a malicious payload, which results in stored XSS. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the administrator's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - CSRF: Attacker crafts a malicious form and tricks an authenticated admin into submitting it
    - XSS: The crafted payload gets saved into the vulnerable setting and is executed when an admin visits the relevant page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted form (CSRF)
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to achieve XSS after the malicious value is saved.
