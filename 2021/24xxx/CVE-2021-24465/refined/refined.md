Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `Meow Gallery` plugin fails to properly sanitize, validate, or escape the `ids` attribute within its gallery shortcode before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `ids` attribute. This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Data Disclosure:**  The SQL injection can be used to extract data from the database by using `UNION SELECT` statements.
- **Arbitrary Object Deserialization:** The injection allows for the manipulation of returned values, leading to the deserialization of arbitrary PHP objects, potentially opening the door for further exploitation if suitable gadgets are present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can steal sensitive data from the database including, but not limited to user password hashes, as demonstrated in the provided proof of concept.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Through object deserialization vulnerabilities, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code on the server. However, this is not explicitly described as part of the exploitation in this content, it is only mentioned that it *could* lead to it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `ids` attribute of the `gallery` shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" privileges to create or edit posts/pages where the malicious shortcode can be placed.
