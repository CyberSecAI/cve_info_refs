- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Default Skin" field in the Hana Flv Player plugin settings does not sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the plugin settings. When a user accesses the plugin settings, the malicious script executes within their browser session. This allows the attacker to potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects a malicious script into the "Default Skin" field via the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to modify plugin settings.
