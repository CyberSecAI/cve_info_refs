- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `tawkto_setwidget` and `tawkto_removewidget` AJAX actions in the Tawk.to Live Chat plugin lack capability and CSRF checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Missing authorization: The AJAX actions are accessible to any authenticated user, including subscribers, without proper capability checks.
    - CSRF: Lack of CSRF protection allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - By exploiting the `tawkto_setwidget` action, low-privileged users can change the 'tawkto-embed-widget-page-id' and 'tawkto-embed-widget-widget-id' parameters, effectively linking the website to their own Tawk.to account.
    - This allows the attacker to monitor website visitors, interact with them, receive contact messages, and display an arbitrary knowledge base.
    - The `tawkto_removewidget` action can be used to remove the live chat widget from the website.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network: The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the vulnerable WordPress site, with subscriber-level access being sufficient.
    - The attacker can send a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tawkto_setwidget` or `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tawkto_removewidget` with the necessary parameters.
