- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LearnPress plugin fails to sanitize, validate, and escape the `id` parameter before using it in SQL statements when duplicating course/lesson/quiz/question.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, and potentially complete compromise of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the `lp-ajax=duplicator` parameter in the `wp-admin/edit.php` page when duplicating course/lesson/quiz/question.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin privileges in WordPress to be able to exploit the vulnerability.
