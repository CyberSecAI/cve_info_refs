- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Pie Register plugin's social login implementation has a flaw that allows unauthenticated users to log in as any user by only knowing their user ID or username.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken authentication and session management, specifically an authentication bypass vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to any user account on the WordPress site, potentially leading to full site compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/pie-register-login/` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no prior authentication and only needs to know the target user's ID or username.
