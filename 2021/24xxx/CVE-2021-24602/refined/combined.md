## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# HM Multiple Roles < 1.3 - Arbitrary Role Change

### Description

The plugin does not have any access control to prevent low privilege users to set themselves as admin via their profile page

### Proof of Concept

As any authenticated user, go to your Profile page and Tick the Administrator Role checkbox. In v1.2, the checkboxes are disabled in the UI but can be tampered with by either using the web browser developer tool or a proxy such as Burp Suite

# Arbitrary Role Change/Privilege Escalation in HM Multiple Roles WordPress plugin

Updated on August 5, 2021 - Harald Eilertsen

While investigating a [security advisory](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/5fd2548a-08de-4417-bff1-f174dab718d5) about an arbitrary role change/privilege escalation issue in the [HM Multiple Roles](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hm-multiple-roles/) WordPress plugin, the Jetpack Scan team discovered that the fix was incomplete and left the plugin still vulnerable.

The issue is fully fixed in version 1.3 of the plugin, and we advise any sites using any earlier version of this plugin to update as soon as possible.

## Details

**Plugin Name:** HM Multiple Roles
**Plugin URI:** <https://wordpress.org/plugins/hm-multiple-roles>
**Author:** HM Plugin
**Author URI:** <https://hmplugin.com/>
**WPScan Entry:** <https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/5fd2548a-08de-4417-bff1-f174dab718d5>

## The Vulnerability

The plugin allows a logged in administrator to assign one or more roles when creating a new user or editing an existing user. Versions before 1.1 would allow any user to assign any combination of roles themselves through the user profile page. Version 1.1 introduced a change that disables the checkboxes for selecting roles for non administrator users.

However, the fix did not check that the request was valid when submitting changes to the profile page. This allowed a low privileged user to escalate their privileges by simply enabling the check boxes for the roles they want and submitting the page.

This can be easily achieved by using the built in developer tools in the web browser as demonstrated in the video below:

**Affected versions:** <= 1.2
**Fixed version:** 1.3
**CVE-ID:** CVE-2021-24602
**CWE:** [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)
**CWSS:** [79.3](https://www.cwss-score.info/#TI:C,1/AP:A,1/AL:A,1/IC:N,1/FC:T,1/RP:RU,0.7/RL:A,1/AV:I,1/AS:M,0.8/IN:NA,1/SC:R,0.5/BI:C,1/DI:H,1/EX:H,1/EC:N,1/P:L,0.7/)
