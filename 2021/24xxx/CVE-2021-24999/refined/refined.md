- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `wcj_notice` parameter before outputting it back in the admin dashboard when the PDF Invoicing module is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin dashboard, which can be executed when an administrator visits the page. This could lead to various impacts, such as session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the administrator's session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes a malicious script in the `wcj_notice` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that targets a WordPress admin page with the vulnerable parameter, and the victim user needs to be logged into the WordPress admin dashboard and click on the malicious link.
