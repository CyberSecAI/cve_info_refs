- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF checks, allowing attackers to induce logged-in administrators to perform unwanted actions. Additionally, a lack of sanitization in settings and verses leads to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
    - Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Attackers can make logged-in administrators perform unintended actions like adding, editing, or deleting verses.
    - Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities by exploiting Stored XSS.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - CSRF is exploited by crafting malicious requests that the administrator unknowingly submits.
    - Stored XSS is achieved by injecting malicious code into the plugin's settings or verse fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into interacting with a malicious link or webpage to execute CSRF.
    - For Stored XSS, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate plugin settings or add/edit verses using the CSRF vulnerability.
