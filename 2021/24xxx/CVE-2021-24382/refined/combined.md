## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Smart Slider 3 < 3.5.0.9 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin did not sanitise the Project Name before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue. By default, only administrator users could access the affected functionality, limiting the exploitability of the vulnerability. However, some WordPress admins may allow lesser privileged users to access the plugin's functionality, in which case, privilege escalation could be performed.

### Proof of Concept

Goto Dashboard -> New Project and enter a JavaScript payload within the Name field (projectName parameter), such as <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>

### Affects Plugins

# Changelog

⚠️ **Warning:**Our updates **weren't made to be backwards compatible**! If you update your Smart Slider, **don't try to downgrade** it to a lower version, because that could create errors!

## Upcoming fixes and features

* Feature: New [Instagram generator](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/2052-instagram-generator). On December 4, [Meta deprecated the Instagram Basic Display API](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2024/09/04/update-on-instagram-basic-display-api/), and because of this, we needed to develop a completely new generator using a different API. With this change, you will need to create a new API following the [documentation's steps](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/2052-instagram-generator).
* Feature: The latest [background animation limitations](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1780-simple-slider-type#background-animation-10) are hardcoded now, to avoid wrong usage.

## 3.5.1.26

##### 2024.12.09.

* Feature: Improved accessibility.
* Fix: [Custom posts generator](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1900-wordpress-custom-posts-generator) supressed PHP notice fixed.
* Fix: Customizer breaks in some cases.

* Other: Black Friday sale notification removed.

## 3.5.1.24

##### 2024.10.15.

* Feature: Asset (css, js) injector code improved.
* Feature: New category variables for [Event Booking generator](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1934-joomla-event-booking-generator).

* Fix: At [Carousel slider type](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1786-carousel-slider-type#animation-tab) if "single switch" is turned off, and "fade" main animation is being used, then some slides disappear upon window resizing.
* Fix: [VirtueMart generator](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1881-joomla-virtuemart-generator) will watch image ordering to define which is the main image.
* Fix: Some background animations are buggy in Chrome, so we rewrote them to use a different animation system. This change came with a [limitation](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1780-simple-slider-type#background-animation-10), that the new system only works well with "fill" [image fill mode](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1809-slider-settings-slides#slides-design).
* Fix: [Eshop generator](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1894-joomla-eshop-generator) compatibility with latest Eshop.
* Fix: [Post IDs](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1806-slider-settings-developer#post-ids-one-per-line) option cleared the given post's cache at every page visit.
* Fix: WordPress free installer will include unminified js and css files.
* Fix: [Generic font family](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family#syntax) names won't have quotemarks around them.

* Fix: At [WordPress Posts generator](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1891-wordpress-posts-generator) if you have a meta data or ACF data with a name already used as a [variable](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1891-wordpress-posts-generator#variables), it can get overwritten.

* Feature: [Youtube videos](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1846-youtube-layer) cannot be started until they fully loaded, but from now on, we will detect early click actions on them and try to start the video once it loaded, as long as it is not prevented by a [browser limitation](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1919-video-slider-issues#autoplay-handling).

* Fix: [Instragram generator token requesting](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/2052-instagram-generator#step-23) doesn't work. We needed to change the **Callback Url** to fix this, so after updating Smart Slider, go to your [application](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and do [step 14, 15 and 16](//smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/2052-instagram-generator#step-14) again!
