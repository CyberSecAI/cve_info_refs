Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Inspirational Quote Rotator plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input within the quote title and content fields when adding or editing quotes through the admin interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the quote fields. This code is then stored in the database and executed in the browsers of users who view the quotes. This vulnerability is present even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking and account compromise.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Stealing sensitive information (if the user is an admin, for example).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the plugin's admin interface where quotes are added or edited (`/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=iqr-settings`).
*   An attacker would insert a malicious JavaScript payload within either the title or content fields of a quote.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges (Admin+) to access the quote management interface of the plugin.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions of the "Inspirational Quote Rotator" plugin up to and including version 1.0.0.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 3.5 (Low), with a vector string of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N`.
*   There is no known fix for this vulnerability, indicating that users should discontinue using the plugin or contact the developer for a patch.
