- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate or sanitize the `order` parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability due to unsanitized user input in the `order` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or unauthorized access to the database. The provided Proof of Concept shows that an attacker can cause a 5 second delay on the server using a `SLEEP()` function in the injected SQL.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the `order` parameter in the `options-general.php` page of the WordPress admin dashboard.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an administrator or have access to the admin dashboard. The CVSS score indicates the attacker needs to have high privileges to exploit the vulnerability (PR:H).
