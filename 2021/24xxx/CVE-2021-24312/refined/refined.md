- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incomplete fix of CVE-2021-24209 in the WP Super Cache plugin. The parameters `$cache_path`, `$wp_cache_debug_ip`, `$wp_super_cache_front_page_text`, `$cache_scheduled_time`, and `$cached_direct_pages` allow the input of `$` and `\n`, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unsanitized user-controlled input in several plugin settings parameters.
    - The ability to inject shell commands due to the insecure handling of special characters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted POST requests to the `wp-admin/options-general.php` page with specific parameters, exploiting the vulnerable settings (`wp_cache_location`, `wp_cache_debug_ip`, `wp_super_cache_front_page_text`, `cache_scheduled_time`, `new_direct_page`).
    - Direct access to `https://target/wp-content/wp-cache-config.php` can be used to run the injected commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the capability to modify plugin settings within the WordPress admin panel (high privileges).
    - The attacker can exploit the vulnerability through the web interface via crafted HTTP requests.
