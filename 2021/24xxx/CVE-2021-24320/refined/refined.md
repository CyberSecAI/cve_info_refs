The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24320.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Bello theme for WordPress does not properly sanitize and escape several parameters in the listing page. This leads to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The vulnerable parameters are: `listing_list_view`, `bt_bb_listing_field_my_lat`, `bt_bb_listing_field_my_lng`, `bt_bb_listing_field_distance_value`, `bt_bb_listing_field_my_lat_default`, `bt_bb_listing_field_keyword`, `bt_bb_listing_field_location_autocomplete`, `bt_bb_listing_field_price_range_from`, and `bt_bb_listing_field_price_range_to`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in multiple parameters within the listing page of the Bello theme.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the affected parameters. When a user visits the crafted URL, the malicious script will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to:
   - Account hijacking
   - Session theft
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
   - Defacement
   - Information theft

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable parameters. When a user clicks on a malicious link, the injected JavaScript will be executed within the userâ€™s browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker doesn't need authentication to perform this attack, they only need to craft malicious links and convince a victim to visit the URL. This is an unauthenticated reflected XSS vulnerability.
