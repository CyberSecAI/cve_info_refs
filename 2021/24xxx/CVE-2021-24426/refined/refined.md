- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize or escape the `tab` parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page that will be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to stealing of sensitive data, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects the malicious script through the `tab` GET parameter in the URL when a victim loads the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL. The victim needs to visit this malicious URL while logged into their WordPress admin session.
