- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `rul_login_url` and `rul_logout_url` parameters before outputting them in attributes within an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable admin page. This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions performed within the context of the victim's session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing XSS payloads in the `rul_login_url` and `rul_logout_url` parameters. The victim is then tricked into submitting the crafted form to the vulnerable admin page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in administrator to visit the malicious URL or submit the crafted form.
