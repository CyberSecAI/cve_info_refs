Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Themify Portfolio Post plugin, versions prior to 1.1.6, fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the Themify Custom Panel, specifically in the "Date," "Client," "Services," and "Link to Launch" fields.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs because user input is not sanitized, allowing malicious JavaScript or HTML to be stored in the database and executed when the affected post is viewed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code, leading to a range of potential impacts, including:
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Stealing sensitive information
    *   Malware distribution
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a contributor-level user creating or editing a portfolio post and inserting malicious code into the vulnerable fields of the Themify Custom Panel.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a registered user with at least "Contributor" privileges on the WordPress website.
    *   The attacker must have access to the portfolio post creation interface.
    *   The attacker must be able to insert malicious scripts or HTML into the specified fields.
*   **Additional details:** The provided content includes a detailed proof of concept demonstrating the attack. It specifies that the XSS is triggered when an editor or admin views the created post/preview.

This information aligns with the general description of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24129, which is a stored XSS in the Themify Portfolio Post plugin.
