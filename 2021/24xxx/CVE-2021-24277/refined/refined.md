- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user inputs from the "Счетчики" (Counters) settings tab before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not sanitize user-provided data before storing it in the database and outputting it in the admin interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when an administrator views the vulnerable page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrative privileges can navigate to the plugin's settings page, specifically the "Счетчики" tab, and inject malicious JavaScript into the input fields for various counters (e.g., Яндекс.Метрика, LiveInternet).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard to modify the plugin's settings.
