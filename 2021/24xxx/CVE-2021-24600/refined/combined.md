## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Dialog <= 1.2.5.5 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings before outputting them in pages, allowing high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the Welcome message (st\_content parameter) of the plugin:
</script><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)> to trigger the XSS in any frontend page
</textarea><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)> to trigger the XSS in the plugin's settings
