**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `update_log` function in `lib/Cleantalk/ApbctWP/Firewall/SFW.php` used to insert records into the database failed to use a prepared SQL statement, leading to a Time-Based Blind SQL Injection vulnerability. The function was vulnerable because it directly included the User-Agent string from the HTTP header into an SQL query without proper sanitization using prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated Time-Based Blind SQL Injection
- Lack of prepared statements in the vulnerable function.
- Direct inclusion of user-supplied input (User-Agent) into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Extraction of sensitive information from the database, including user emails and password hashes.
- Unauthorized access to potentially any data stored in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating cookies set by the plugin to bypass certain restrictions, specifically setting `ct_sfw_passed` cookie.
- Sending malicious SQL code within the User-Agent request header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Unauthenticated attacker.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- Ability to manipulate cookies.
