- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize or escape the "Steam Group Address" setting before outputting it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By entering a malicious payload in the "Steam Group Address" setting of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated user with the ability to modify the plugin settings.
