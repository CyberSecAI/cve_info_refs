- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Social Profiles field values before outputting them in attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view posts published by the compromised user. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a post published by a user that added malicious javascript to their social profile fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a role as low as contributor to be able to edit the social profile fields and inject the malicious scripts. The XSS will be triggered on posts published by the user.
