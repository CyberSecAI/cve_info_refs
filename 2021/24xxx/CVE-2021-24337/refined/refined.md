Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `id` parameter in the `edit-video-embed` page of the "Video Embed Box" WordPress plugin is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization for the `id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerable code blocks are located in `video_embed.php` at lines 133 and 149:

    ```php
    $data = $wpdb->get_row('SELECT * FROM '.$wpdb->prefix.'video_embed WHERE `id` =  ' . $_GET['id']);
    ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, configuration settings, and other potentially confidential data.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although the provided proof of concept demonstrates information disclosure using `UNION SELECT`, more advanced techniques could potentially lead to privilege escalation in the worst-case scenario if the underlying database user has the necessary privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the WordPress admin panel.
*   **Forced Browsing:** The vulnerable page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=edit-video-embed`) is not directly linked in the menu, but can be accessed by forced browsing by crafting the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** A user with "subscriber" level access is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to extract information such as the current user, database name, version, and datadir.
*   The plugin has been closed, indicating no fix is available.

This vulnerability is classified as a critical severity with a CVSS score of 9.1.
