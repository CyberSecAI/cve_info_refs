- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SupportCandy plugin fails to properly validate and escape the `page` attribute within its shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the plugin's shortcode with a malicious `page` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to create posts or pages that contain the malicious shortcode.
