- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin suffered from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issues, allowing an attacker to make a logged-in administrator add, edit, or delete form fields. This, in turn, could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The CSRF issue was fixed in version 5.11.1, however, some sanitization was still missing, allowing XSS through other pages using a high privilege account.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CSRF vulnerability: An attacker could exploit the lack of CSRF protection to perform actions on behalf of an administrator.
    - Stored XSS vulnerability: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into form fields which are then executed when the form field is rendered in various locations.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - CSRF: An attacker could add, edit, or delete form fields, potentially modifying the functionality of the Business Directory plugin
    - XSS: An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to account takeover, information theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - CSRF: The attacker would need to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form.
    - XSS: The attacker injects malicious Javascript into the form fields, which is then stored on the server. This is then triggered when the affected form fields are displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - CSRF: The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint while the victim is logged in. This may be achieved through social engineering or through another XSS vulnerability.
    - XSS: The attacker needs to exploit the CSRF to edit form fields and insert Javascript payloads. Alternatively, the attacker needs an admin account to achieve the same result.
