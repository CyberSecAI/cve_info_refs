{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not enforce authorization checks on several AJAX actions and exposes the CSRF nonce to all authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Broken Access Control",
    "Unauthorised AJAX Calls",
    "CSRF nonce exposure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user, like a subscriber, can:\n1) Get and search through the title and content of draft posts.\n2) Get the title of a password-protected post.\n3) Upload an image from a URL.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting AJAX requests and sending them to the vulnerable endpoints with the exposed CSRF nonce, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (even a low-privileged subscriber role is sufficient) on the WordPress website."
