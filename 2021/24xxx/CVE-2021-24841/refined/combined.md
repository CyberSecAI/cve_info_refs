Information

Exploit title : XSS Stored Helpful 4.4.55

Date : 06102021

Exploit Author : https://twitter.com/mika_sec

Exploitation

For our example go to Helpful and click on Settings :

And now navigate to System :

Click on Miscellaneous and inject in Custom timezone field this payload & after that
click on Save Changes :

"><details open ontoggle="prompt(1)">

It will be stored and reflected every time the admin comes here :

But it's not the only Stored XSS, now we can use the same technique here :

It's also works in Before voting, After voting & Feeback fields, for our example i'll

choose Answer buttons :

\

If we go to a post where the Helpful widget is, the payload will run when the button

loads :

You can use the same technique for After voting, it will run after your vote (depends

on your voting choice).

Feeback fields are also vulnerable :

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Helpful < 4.4.59 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the System > Miscellaneous > Custom Timezone setting of the plugin: "><details open ontoggle="alert(/XSS/)">
The XSS will be triggered when viewing the settings page
Put the following payload "><details open ontoggle="alert(/XSS/)"> in Texts > Before Voting / After Voting / Answer Buttons / Admin Columns > Feedback settings
The XSS will be triggered when viewing a post/page where with the Helpful Widget is displayed, or after a vote depending on the vulnerable field/s used
Put the following payload in the Feedback > Messages: "><details open ontoggle="alert(/XSS/)">
The plugin fixes from 4.4.56 to 4.4.58 were insufficient as not escaping data when output in attributes, allowing for payloads such as " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
