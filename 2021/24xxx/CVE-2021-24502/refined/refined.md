Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-24502:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The WordPress plugin "WP Google Map" did not sanitize or escape the "Map Title" before outputting it on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Map Title". This code would then execute in the browsers of users who view the map, allowing the attacker to potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other harmful actions within the context of the user's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to create a new map in the plugin's settings.
- The attacker adds the XSS payload to the "Map Title".
- The attacker selects the option to "Show as map title".
- The attacker then adds the map to a page or post using the shortcode provided by the plugin.
- When a user views the page or post containing the map with the malicious title, the XSS payload will be executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a high-privilege user account on the WordPress site to be able to create or modify map entries. Even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed this vulnerability is exploitable.
