{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The AJAX action 'cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback' in multiple WP-Buy plugins allows low-privileged users to install and activate arbitrary plugins.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control, allowing unauthorized plugin installation and activation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can install vulnerable plugins, potentially leading to more critical vulnerabilities like Remote Code Execution (RCE). They can also activate installed plugins.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a POST request to '/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' with the 'action=do_button_job_later' parameter, along with either 'slug' to install a plugin or 'plugin_file' to activate a plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A low-privileged user account on the WordPress site."
