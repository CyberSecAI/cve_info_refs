Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The FileBird plugin version 4.7.3 was vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user input in SQL queries. Specifically, the plugin was directly using unescaped user-provided data from a HTTP POST request in the `get_col` function which then passed the unescaped data to a SQL query, creating a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, where an attacker cannot see the direct output of the query but can infer results by crafting specific queries that return different results based on the injected code.
*   **Unescaped User Input:** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization or escaping of user-provided data before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The REST API endpoint which invokes the vulnerable function does not require any authentication, making it accessible to anonymous users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, as demonstrated by the proof of concept which attempts to retrieve the `user_pass` from the `wp_users` table.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** While the provided information does not explicitly state further impact, SQL injection can often be used for more severe attacks, including modification of data, or gaining further access to the underlying system, depending on database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specifically crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-json/filebird/v1/gutenberg-get-images` endpoint.
*   **REST API Endpoint:** The unauthenticated REST API endpoint makes it possible for any user to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or user accounts on the vulnerable website.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable website to send malicious HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint and request parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable REST endpoint and the structure of the POST data, in order to inject malicious SQL code.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Ravi Chandra from 10up.
* The vulnerability was reported to the plugin authors and WPScan.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.7.4 of the FileBird plugin.
* The provided PoC demonstrates how to use a SQL UNION to retrieve the user's password hash.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.6, considered high severity.
* It is categorized under OWASP A1: Injection and CWE-89.
