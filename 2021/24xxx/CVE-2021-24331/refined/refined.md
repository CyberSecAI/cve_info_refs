- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin did not properly sanitize and validate its settings, specifically `psb_distance`, `psb_buttonsize`, and `psb_speed`, relying only on client-side validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will then execute in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `psb_distance`, `psb_buttonsize`, or `psb_speed` parameters within the plugin's settings through a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-post.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in the WordPress instance to access and modify the plugin's settings.
