- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate or escape the `orderby` and `order` parameters before using them in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint, specifically the `bsk-pdf-manager` page, where the `order` and `orderby` parameters are vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to access the vulnerable page.
