- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "All Subscribers" setting page of the Popup Builder plugin was vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable page. If a user clicks on the crafted link, the attacker's script will execute within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL that includes a script in the `sgpb-subscribers-date` parameter, specifically the `http://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=popupbuilder&page=sgpbSubscribers&sgpb-subscribers-date=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28origin%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a user with the appropriate privileges into clicking on it. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability but needs a valid authenticated user to be affected by it.
