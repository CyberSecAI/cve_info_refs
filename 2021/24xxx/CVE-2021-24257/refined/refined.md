Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24257:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input within the "Premium Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin. Specifically, several widgets within the plugin allow users to select HTML tags from a dropdown menu to format text. However, these tag options were not properly enforced on the server-side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The plugin allows users, including those with lower privileges such as contributors, to inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML tag parameters of various widgets (e.g. `premium_testimonial_person_name_size`, `premium_blog_title_tag`). This code is then stored in the database and executed when the page is viewed or previewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Site Takeover:** If an administrator is targeted, successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could lead to the attacker gaining complete control over the website.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with contributor-level access could inject malicious JavaScript, which would then be executed when an administrator previews or views the content. This could lead to privilege escalation, where the attacker's malicious code runs with admin rights.
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript can perform arbitrary actions, including redirecting users, stealing cookies, or performing other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   **Exploitable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameters are located within various widgets and include, but are not limited to, `premium_testimonial_person_name_size`, `premium_blog_title_tag`, `premium_banner_title_tag`, `premium_dual_header_first_header_tag`, `premium_person_name_heading`, `premium_person_title_heading`, `premium_pricing_table_title_size` and `premium_title_tag`.
*   **Payload Injection:** An attacker can modify a request (e.g. via a tool like Burp Suite) that submits the Elementor form and inject a `<script>` tag or other malicious HTML. For example, by changing the heading tag to a `<script>` tag, or by providing a remote script source in the parameter e.g., `script+src=\"https://ramgall.com/alertscript.js\"`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a WordPress account with at least "contributor" privileges.
*   **Elementor Editor Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Elementor editor to add or modify page content.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker could intercept the request to save the elementor page in order to modify the relevant parameters.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is similar to other XSS vulnerabilities found in the main Elementor plugin and other add-ons, suggesting a common flaw in how user-controlled HTML tags were handled by multiple developers.
*   The `wp_kses` function, which is intended to sanitize HTML, was not sufficient to prevent this attack.
*   The Wordfence firewall rule for the original Elementor vulnerability also provides protection for these vulnerabilities.
*   The CVSS score provided by wpscan is 6.8 (medium) while Wordfence indicates a score of 6.4.
