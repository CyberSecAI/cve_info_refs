- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `get_sliders()` function in the plugin does not sanitize or validate the `orderby` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Blind SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database or potentially alter data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `orderby` parameter in a GET or POST request to sort items in the plugin's menu within the admin dashboard.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin dashboard.
