- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly validate and sanitize the `order` and `orderby` GET parameters before using them in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the database.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious SQL code through the `order` and `orderby` GET parameters when accessing the plugin's log page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=check-email-logs`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable page.
