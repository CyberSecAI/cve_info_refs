- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `keyword` parameter in the Post Grid plugin is not properly escaped before being outputted within an HTML attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which can then be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as redirecting the user to malicious sites, stealing cookies, or performing actions on the user's behalf.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL that includes the `keyword` parameter with a JavaScript payload. When a user visits this URL, the payload is reflected in the HTML output, leading to execution within the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and have the victim visit them. No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability.
