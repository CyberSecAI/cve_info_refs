Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24204:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of server-side validation and improper sanitization of HTML tags within several Elementor widgets. Specifically, the `html_tag` or `header_size` parameters of these widgets were not validated and were output without proper escaping, allowing users to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript injected via the vulnerable parameters is stored in the database and executed when a user views or previews the affected page or post.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The server-side code did not validate user input for HTML tags, allowing arbitrary HTML, including `<script>` tags, to be saved.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The output of the `html_tag` and similar parameters were not properly escaped, allowing the browser to interpret the injected JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Site Takeover:** If an administrator viewed a post with malicious JavaScript, the attacker could leverage the administrator's session to take over the site, create new malicious administrator accounts, or add backdoors.
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of any user that interacts with the affected page or post.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The injected JavaScript could be used to steal user data or manipulate the website content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers with the required privileges (Contributor or above) could inject malicious code by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the `save_builder` action with a malicious `html_tag` parameter.
- **Elementor Editor:** Attackers use the Elementor editor interface to inject the malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least Contributor-level privileges on the WordPress site to access the Elementor editor.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know which parameters in the specific widgets are vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Widgets:** The vulnerabilities affected multiple widgets including, but not limited to:
    - Column
    - Accordion
    - Icon Box
    - Image Box
    - Heading
    - Divider
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerabilities were mitigated by implementing server-side input validation for HTML tags, allowing only a predefined list of allowed tags, in addition to output escaping.
- **Timeline:**
    - **February 23, 2021:** Wordfence Threat Intelligence disclosed the vulnerabilities to Elementor.
    - **March 2, 2021:** Initial patch released in Elementor 3.1.2.
    - **March 8, 2021:** Additional fixes in Elementor 3.1.4.
- **CVSS Score:** 6.4 (Medium)
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
