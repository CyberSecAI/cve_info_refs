- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Tutor LMS plugin allows a local file inclusion vulnerability through the `sub_page` parameter within the plugin's Tools page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of the `sub_page` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: High privilege users can include arbitrary local php files, potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure or arbitrary code execution, depending on the included file.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the `wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint with a malicious `sub_page` parameter, specifically targeting the `tutor-tools` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a high privilege user (e.g., administrator) to access the vulnerable functionality.
