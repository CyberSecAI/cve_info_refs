- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize or escape the Service Prices before outputting it in the List.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: High privilege users can perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, allowing arbitrary script execution in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding a malicious script within the "Price" field when adding or editing a service in the admin panel (Services > Add service) in the "Service Params" section. The XSS is then triggered when the Services list is viewed (/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=services).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privilege access (e.g., Administrator or Editor role) to access the service creation/edit interface.
