## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Book appointment Online < 1.39 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or escape Service Prices before outputting it in the List, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

In the admin dashboard navigate to Services > Add service and put the following payload in the Price (Service Params section): <script>alert('test')</script>
The XSS will be triggered in the Services list (/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=services)
