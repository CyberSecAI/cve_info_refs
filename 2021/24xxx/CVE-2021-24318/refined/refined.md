- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Listeo theme failed to verify if the user making the request owned the Post/Page or Booking they were trying to delete.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability, allowing unauthorized access to delete content.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Any authenticated user could delete arbitrary posts/pages and bookings they do not own.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **PoC #1**:  An authenticated user can send a crafted GET request to `/my-listings/` with `action=delete`,  `listing_id` and `_wpnonce` parameters. The `listing_id` parameter can be manipulated to delete any post/page ID.
    - **PoC #2**: An authenticated user can send a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the parameters `action=listeo_bookings_manage`, `booking_id` and `status=deleted`. The `booking_id` parameter can be manipulated to delete any booking ID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site using the vulnerable theme.
