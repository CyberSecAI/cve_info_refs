The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Newsletter, SMTP, Email marketing and Subscribe forms by Sendinblue" WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin fails to sanitize the `sib-statistics-date` parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser by crafting a malicious URL. This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted POST request targeting the `wp-admin/admin.php?page=sib_page_statistics` endpoint. An attacker would need to convince a user (typically an administrator) to submit the form containing the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to submit the crafted form. This likely involves social engineering or tricking a user into clicking a malicious link. The attacker does not need prior access to the WordPress site itself.

The vulnerability is in versions of the plugin prior to 3.1.25.
