- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate, escape, or sanitize shortcode attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist due to improper handling of shortcode attributes and video metadata (when API key configured).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view the page containing the crafted shortcode, leading to potential session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by using crafted shortcode attributes in the `youtube` or `youtube_thumb` shortcodes or embedding a video with malicious XSS payloads in the title or description.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A contributor-level user or higher is needed to be able to inject the malicious shortcodes into posts or pages, and if the admin has configured an API key, XSS can be triggered via a video with a malicious title or description.
