- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize IP addresses obtained from HTTP headers before displaying them in the reports table. Specifically, the plugin doesn't escape the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the reports page. This code will be executed when a user views the reports page in the WordPress admin panel, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker sends a login request to `/wp-login.php` with a malicious payload in the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
    - The plugin logs the malicious payload (IP address) without proper sanitization.
    - When an administrator views the reports page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=reports`), the stored XSS payload is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted login request to the WordPress login page.
