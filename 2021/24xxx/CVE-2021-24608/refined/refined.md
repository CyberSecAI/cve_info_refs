Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24608:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2021-24608 and details a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Formidable Forms plugin for WordPress, which aligns with the CVE description of a stored XSS vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

The root cause lies in the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input, specifically within the labels of form fields. This allows malicious HTML and JavaScript to be stored in the database and rendered later in the context of the website.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts are injected and stored in the database via the plugin's form builder settings.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal session cookies, which could lead to account hijacking.
*   **Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Defacement:** Modification of the website's content, which leads to defacement of the website.
*   **Data Theft:** If the victim is an administrator, the attacker may be able to steal sensitive information from the database.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   The primary attack vector is through the plugin's form builder interface. An attacker with sufficient privileges (Admin+) can create or edit a form and inject malicious JavaScript into a field label.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker must have administrative privileges (Admin+) or higher to access the Formidable Form builder and modify form fields.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin:** Knowledge of the plugin's vulnerability is required to construct the attack payload.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions of Formidable Forms prior to 5.0.07.
*   The fix in version 5.0.07 involves stripping unsafe HTML from labels and other form elements.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
*   The CVSS score is 3.8 (Low), which reflects the need for administrative privileges.
