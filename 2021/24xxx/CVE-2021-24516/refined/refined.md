- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize the "Form Title" before outputting it in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with high privileges (e.g., admin) can set a malicious XSS payload within the "Form Title". When the form list or the related form is viewed, the injected script will execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with high privileges (e.g., admin) in the WordPress site.
