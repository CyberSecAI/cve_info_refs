- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Onair2 theme and KenthaRadio plugin exposed a proxy functionality to unauthenticated users, allowing them to send requests to this proxy. This enables the web server to fetch and display content from any URI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The proxy functionality allows an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external addresses, potentially revealing sensitive internal resources or interacting with internal services.
  - Remote File Inclusion (RFI): By controlling the URI, an attacker can potentially include and execute arbitrary files from external sources.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker could exploit the SSRF vulnerability to potentially gain access to internal resources or interact with internal services.
    - The RFI vulnerability could be used to execute malicious code on the server, leading to a full compromise of the application and underlying system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request to the exposed proxy functionality using the `qtproxycall` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need authentication and can exploit this from a remote position as long as the vulnerable endpoint is reachable.
