Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control within the Modern Events Calendar Lite plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to restrict access to the event export functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of authentication checks before allowing access to the event export feature.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users (i.e., users who are not logged in) to trigger the export function.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability results in sensitive data being disclosed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** An attacker can export all event data in CSV or XML formats, potentially exposing sensitive information about events, attendees, locations, etc.
- **No Integrity or Availability Impact**: The vulnerability allows for reading of data but not modification of data, or service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests to specific URLs.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No login or prior access to the website is needed to initiate the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required**: The attacker does not need to have any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target website.
- **Basic Knowledge of HTTP:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to specific URLs.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable endpoints are:
    - `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=MEC-ix&tab=MEC-export&mec-ix-action=export-events&format=csv`
    - `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=MEC-ix&tab=MEC-export&mec-ix-action=export-events&format=xml`
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.16.5 of the Modern Events Calendar Lite plugin.
- The vulnerability is classified as **OWASP A5: Broken Access Control** and **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**
- The CVSS score is 5.3 (Medium) with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, reflecting the network attack vector, low complexity, no required privileges or user interaction, and a low confidentiality impact without any effect on integrity or availability.
