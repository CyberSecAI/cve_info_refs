Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24347:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Inadequate file extension check: The plugin attempts to prevent the upload of potentially dangerous files (like PHP files) by checking their extensions. However, this check is case-sensitive, allowing attackers to bypass it by changing the case of the extension (e.g., from "php" to "pHP").

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Case-sensitive file extension validation: The plugin fails to properly sanitize file uploads, allowing users to upload files that should be blocked by simply changing the case of the file extension
- Unrestricted file uploads (to an extent): The plugin advertises allowing users to upload and manage files without limits, but also attempts (inadequately) to block certain file types

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading a PHP webshell, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- File upload vulnerability: The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's file upload functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site to access the file upload feature.
- Intercept and modify requests: The attacker needs to be able to intercept the file upload request and modify the filename parameter before sending it to the server.
