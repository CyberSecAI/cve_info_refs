- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize inputs when adding new items to an accordion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the victim's browser when they access the affected pages (both the admin page and frontend pages where the accordion is displayed), potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding a crafted payload to an accordion item's title through the plugin's interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have admin privileges in order to add/modify accordion items.
