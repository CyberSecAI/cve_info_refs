- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Slide "Title", "Description", and Gallery "Title" fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow high-privilege users (Admin+) to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to actions such as redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing sensitive data, or performing unauthorized actions on the website.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious payloads within the "Title" and "Description" fields when creating/editing Slides or Galleries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a user with administrative privileges (Admin+) to create/edit a Slide or Gallery and insert the malicious payload. The XSS is triggered in both the backend and frontend.
