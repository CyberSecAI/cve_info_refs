The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24428.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-controlled settings before saving and outputting them in the admin dashboard.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin is vulnerable to XSS even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which would then be executed in the browsers of administrators or other users who access the affected admin pages. This could lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page in the WordPress admin panel. An authenticated user with the necessary privileges can inject malicious code through specific parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level access or equivalent privileges to modify plugin settings.

The vulnerable parameters are: &ytnetw=, &ytnetwspan=, &ytfeedbacknetw=, &ytfeedbacknetwspan=, &ytratingmin=, &ytratingmax=.
