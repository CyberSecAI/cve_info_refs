- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Ninja Forms plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the custom class name of a form field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically custom class names for form fields.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be an administrator or high privilege user with access to the form builder, specifically "Dev Mode," they add a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Custom Class Names Container" field of a form field. When a user views or previews the page with the embedded form, the malicious code is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a high privilege user within the WordPress site, typically an administrator, with access to the Ninja Forms form builder. They also need the "Dev Mode" enabled.
