Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Backup Guard plugin's failure to properly validate the file type and content of imported backup files. Specifically, it doesn't enforce that uploaded files are of the intended `.sgbp` format and extension. This lack of validation allows high-privilege users (administrators and above) to upload arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin allows the upload of any file type without verifying the content, which leads to arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** The plugin fails to check if the imported file is indeed a backup file.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The plugin doesn't validate the uploaded file's content or extension, allowing for malicious files to be uploaded.
*  **Bypass of .htaccess Protection**: The plugin is using .htaccess for protection which can be bypassed by uploading another .htaccess file to overwrite the protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the website.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could potentially alter the website's content.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker could gain access to sensitive data or manipulate data stored on the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although the vulnerability requires high privileges, once an attacker has gained access they can potentially escalate their privileges on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack involves sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `backup_guard_importBackup` action.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The malicious file is sent as part of the multipart form data in the POST request.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious file disguised as a backup file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Administrator or Higher Privilege User:** The attacker must have administrative access (or at least high-level access) to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the Backup Guard plugin prior to 1.6.0.
*   Version 1.6.0 attempts to fix the vulnerability by forcing the uploaded file to have the `.sgbp` extension, but this is not a full fix as content isn't verified. This can still be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve RCE.
*   The .htaccess protection in the upload directory can be bypassed by uploading a new .htaccess file with invalid content which invalidates the protection. This bypass is especially critical on web servers like Nginx which do not support .htaccess by default.
