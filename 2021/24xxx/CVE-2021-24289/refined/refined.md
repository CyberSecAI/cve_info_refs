The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-24289.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Store Locator Plus plugin had functionality that allowed authenticated users to update their user meta data, specifically their `wp_capabilities`, to become administrators.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authenticated Privilege Escalation:** Authenticated users (even low-level users like subscribers) could elevate their privileges to administrator by directly manipulating user metadata.
- **Inadequate Capability Checks:** Although CSRF protection was added, no capability checks were implemented, allowing low-level users to still exploit the endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Complete site takeover: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain administrative access to the WordPress site.
- Full control over the site and its data.
- Ability to inject backdoors or create new administrative user accounts

**Attack vectors:**
- By making a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the action `slp_change_option`.
- Manipulating the `formdata[option_name]` parameter to target `user_meta[wp_capabilities]`.
- Setting `formdata[option_value][administrator]` to `1`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the affected WordPress site, even with low-level privileges (e.g., subscriber).
- Ability to make HTTP POST requests.
