- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `gwolle_gb_user_email` parameter before outputting it back in an attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin page by crafting a specific request. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the victim's browser, allowing for actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the admin page of the vulnerable plugin, specifically targeting the `gwolle_gb_user_email` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious POST request and induce a logged in admin user to submit it.
