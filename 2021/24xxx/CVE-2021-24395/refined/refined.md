Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24395

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization, escaping, or validation of the `editid` GET parameter before it is used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The unsanitized `editid` parameter is directly concatenated into a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `editid` parameter passed through the GET request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to the extraction of sensitive data, such as user credentials, private posts, or other confidential information stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data from the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the database, an attacker could potentially grant themselves administrative privileges or modify user roles.
*   **Full Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, complete compromise of the WordPress site is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint with the `page=embed-youtube-video-add` parameter, and the malicious payload within the `editid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges to access the vulnerable plugin page and exploit the SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerability is located in `options.php` at line 65: `$getdata = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE id=".$_GET['editid']);`
*   **Exploit Example:**
    ```
    GET /wp-admin/admin.php?page=embed-youtube-video-add&editid=-6425+UNION+ALL+SELECT+NULL%2Cuser%28%29%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CNULL-- HTTP/1.1
    ```
This exploit example uses a SQL injection payload (`-6425+UNION+ALL+SELECT+NULL%2Cuser%28%29%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CNULL--`) to extract the database user.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Plugin:** embed-youtube-video version 1.0 and possibly lower versions
*   **CVSS Score:** 6.7 (Medium)
*   **OWASP Category:** A1: Injection
*   **CWE:** CWE-89
