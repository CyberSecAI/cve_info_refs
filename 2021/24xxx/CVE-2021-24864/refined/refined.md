Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `wp-cloudy` plugin not sanitizing the `post_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query within the admin dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL Injection vulnerability. Specifically, the `post` parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** A successful SQL Injection attack could allow a malicious actor to read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the WordPress database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, this could also lead to further compromise, such as privilege escalation depending on the database setup.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed through the admin dashboard via the `admin.php` endpoint.
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a crafted `post` parameter containing SQL injection payloads.
- The specific vulnerable URL is: `/wp-admin/admin.php?action=wpc_duplicate_post_as_draft&post=[SQL Injection Payload]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to be an administrator or have sufficient privileges to access the vulnerable admin dashboard endpoint and execute the function `wpc_duplicate_post_as_draft`.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is consistent with the description from the CVE.
- The patch provided in version 4.4.9 included a sanitization of the POST parameter using `intval()` and `wp_unslash()` in `wpcloudy.php`.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 and OWASP A1: Injection.
- CVSS Score is rated as 6.8 (Medium) with vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
