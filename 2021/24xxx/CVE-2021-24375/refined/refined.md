Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `motor_load_more`, `motor_gallery_load_more`, `motor_quick_view`, and `motor_project_quick_view` AJAX handlers within the Motor WordPress theme. These handlers directly include or use `get_template_part` with user-supplied file paths, which leads to Local File Inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The theme allows an unauthenticated attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.
*   **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use relative paths (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`) to access files outside the intended directories.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable AJAX handlers do not require any authentication, making them accessible to anyone.
*   **Direct File Inclusion:** The `motor_load_more` handler directly includes the file specified in the `$_POST['file']` parameter using `include($_POST['file'])`, allowing arbitrary code execution when a PHP file is included.
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The theme doesn't validate or sanitize the `$_POST['file']` parameter before using it in `include()` or `get_template_part()`.
*   **Improper use of `get_template_part()`:** Although `get_template_part()` is a WordPress function intended to load template files, it does not sanitize the file paths provided to it. This function relies on the caller to ensure the supplied paths are safe.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read any file on the server that the webserver process has access to. This can include sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, or database credentials.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including PHP files from the server file system, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a complete takeover of the vulnerable website, allowing attackers to install malware, create backdoors, or steal data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** Attackers send POST requests to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to one of the vulnerable handlers: `motor_load_more`, `motor_gallery_load_more`, `motor_quick_view`, or `motor_project_quick_view`. The file path to be included is supplied via the `file` parameter.
*   **URL Parameters:** For `motor_quick_view` and `motor_project_quick_view`, a `product_id` or `project_id` parameter needs to be included in the URL or POST data, but the value is not validated.
*   **Relative Path Traversal:** Attackers use relative paths to navigate up directories and access arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication is required:** The attacker does not need to have an account or any specific permissions on the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Motor theme versions prior to 3.1.0.
*   The `motor_load_more` handler is vulnerable to direct file inclusion using the `include()` PHP function.
*   The `motor_quick_view` and `motor_project_quick_view` handlers are vulnerable via the `get_template_part()` WordPress API, which does not sanitize the input.
*   Version 2.x of the theme allows the attacker to both read arbitrary files of any type and execute arbitrary PHP scripts. Version 3.0 allows only the execution of PHP scripts.
*   The proof of concepts show how an attacker can read `/etc/passwd` and execute a malicious PHP script located elsewhere on the server.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Path Traversal) and CWE-36 (Improper Handling of Filename or Pathnames).
