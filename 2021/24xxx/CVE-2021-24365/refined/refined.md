Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24365:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-controlled data within the "Custom Field" column type of the Admin Columns plugin. Specifically, when a "Custom Field" is configured to display data from a database column, the plugin fails to escape HTML tags present in the data before rendering it on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into a database field that is then displayed via the "Custom Field" column, causing the code to execute within the browsers of other users who view the affected tables.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Compromise of user accounts:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Account takeover, even of high-privileged users such as administrators
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Further attacks within the application

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the "Custom Field" column within the Admin Columns plugin.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered in both the WordPress frontend and backend.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to modify data in a database column that is then displayed via a "Custom Field" in an Admin Column. This could be through access to a user account that has the ability to set custom field values using a plugin such as "Advanced Custom Fields" or similar means.
*   The attacker does not need administrative access to the Admin Columns plugin itself, but would need some level of authenticated access to the system to modify the database content.
*  The user viewing the column data does not need to interact with the page to trigger the XSS, the rendering of the page loads the XSS payload automatically.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects both the free and pro versions of the Admin Columns plugin, specifically versions prior to 4.3.2 (free) and 5.5.2 (pro).
*   The issue was discovered by Johannes Lauinger of SySS GmbH.
*   The provided content includes a detailed proof of concept (PoC) for reproducing the vulnerability.
