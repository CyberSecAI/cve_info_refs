Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Photo Gallery plugin failed to sanitize uploaded SVG files, allowing malicious JavaScript code embedded within them to be executed.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input validation on uploaded SVG files. This enables attackers to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server and executed when other users access the image.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Upload:** Attackers upload a specially crafted SVG file containing JavaScript code through the plugin's "Add Images" upload functionality.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have the ability to add images to a gallery in the WordPress site. This typically requires at least contributor-level access.
    *   The attacker needs to create an SVG file with embedded malicious Javascript code.
    *   No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, it is triggered when accessing the uploaded image file directly.
