  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the admin dashboard, potentially leading to actions performed on behalf of the administrator or further compromise of the site.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the 'id' GET parameter, and tricking a logged in administrator to access it.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and needs a logged-in administrator to visit this URL."
