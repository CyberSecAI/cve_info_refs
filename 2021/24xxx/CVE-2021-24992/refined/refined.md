- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters before outputting them in attributes and on the page. Specifically, the "Website URL" field and the label field of a button.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding/editing a button and setting the button action to "Website URL" with a malicious JavaScript payload, or using a malicious payload in the label.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to create/edit buttons.
