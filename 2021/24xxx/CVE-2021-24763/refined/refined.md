Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in the `save_global_setting` AJAX action within the Perfect Survey WordPress plugin. This allows unauthorized users to call the AJAX action. Additionally, the plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied data when saving settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Missing Authorization:** The plugin does not verify if the user initiating the AJAX request has the necessary permissions to perform the action. This allows unauthenticated users to access and modify plugin settings.
* **Missing CSRF Protection:** The absence of CSRF checks makes it possible for attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions, including changing settings.
* **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user input when updating settings. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which will then be executed in the context of any user who views a survey using the affected plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized Settings Modification:** Attackers can modify survey settings.
* **Stored XSS:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users viewing surveys, potentially leading to:
    * **Data theft:** Stealing sensitive user information, including session cookies or other data.
    * **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    * **Malware installation:** Tricking users into downloading and installing malware.
    * **Defacement:** Changing the appearance or behavior of the website to cause harm or damage to the reputation.
    * **Arbitrary code execution:** In rare cases, if XSS is combined with other exploits, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on a user's browser or machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Unauthenticated AJAX Call:** An attacker can directly make an AJAX call to the vulnerable endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=save_global_setting`) with crafted data. No prior login to WordPress is required.
* **CSRF:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in WordPress user, will trigger an AJAX request to modify the plugin's settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress site.
* **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject CSS and XSS code through the `ps_options_custom_css` parameter.
* The vulnerability is classified as a "NO AUTHORISATION" issue.
* The CVSS score is 8.8 (High).
* This vulnerability affects versions of the Perfect Survey plugin prior to 1.5.2.
