Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of server-side validation in the Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin. Specifically, the plugin allows users to add custom scripts to the header and footer of a page or post through a feature which does not verify if the user has the `unfiltered_html` capability before saving the scripts. This bypasses client-side protections meant to restrict script injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the plugin allows users, including those with lower privileges (e.g., contributors, authors), to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the header and footer sections of pages or posts. This is because there are no server-side checks to verify if a user has permissions to add these scripts, even when the client side UI is hidden.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The plugin does not properly check user permissions before allowing the modification of header/footer scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript, which executes in the browser whenever a user visits the affected page/post.
*   **Site Takeover:** The injected scripts can be used to perform a variety of malicious activities, including but not limited to:
    *   Redirecting visitors to malicious websites.
    *   Creating new administrative users, leading to site takeover.
    *   Injecting backdoors.
    *   Altering site content.
    *   Stealing user session data, cookies etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting and sending HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   **Authenticated:** An attacker needs to have a user account with at least the "contributor" or "author" role on the target WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability by adding scripts to page header/footer fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs a valid WordPress user account with "contributor" or "author" level access.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin is installed and vulnerable on the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable site.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) script demonstrates how to programmatically exploit this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 6.4.
* The fix for this vulnerability was included in version 2.10.3 of the Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin.
