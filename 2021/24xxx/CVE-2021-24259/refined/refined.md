Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in several widgets of the "Elementor Addon Elements" plugin. Specifically, the plugin allows users to specify HTML tags for text elements, but it doesn't enforce the allowed tags on the server-side. This allows users with contributor-level access to inject malicious JavaScript code through these tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is saved within the plugin's settings and executed when the affected pages are viewed or previewed by other users.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided HTML tag values, allowing arbitrary HTML and JavaScript to be injected.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Enforcement:** The plugin relies on client-side dropdown menus to restrict HTML tag options, but doesn't enforce these restrictions server-side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Site Takeover:** By exploiting this XSS vulnerability, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into a page, potentially leading to site takeover. If an administrator views a page with the injected script, the attacker can potentially steal credentials or execute malicious code with admin privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with contributor-level access could potentially escalate their privileges by exploiting the XSS to target a user with higher access level such as an editor or administrator.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The injected JavaScript could be used to steal sensitive user information or manipulate data within the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Widgets:**  The vulnerable widgets include:
    *   Flip Box (front\_title\_html\_tag, back\_title\_html\_tag)
    *   Price Table (heading\_tag, sub\_heading\_tag)
    *   Split Text (title\_size)
    *   Text Separator (html\_tag, title)
    *   Timeline (html\_tag)
*   **Crafted "save\_builder" requests:** Attackers can send modified 'save\_builder' requests with malicious HTML tags set to javascript. For example, they can set "front\_title\_html\_tag" to "script" and include the javascript within "front\_title" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs a WordPress user account with at least "contributor" permissions to access the Elementor editor and modify content using vulnerable widgets.
*   **Ability to craft requests**: Attacker needs to be able to modify HTTP requests to inject malicious payloads, often this can be done via browser developer tools or a proxy.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to previously disclosed XSS vulnerabilities in the main Elementor plugin.
*   Multiple Elementor add-on plugins were found to have the same vulnerability pattern.
*   The issue was resolved in version 1.11.2 of the "Elementor Addon Elements" plugin.
