## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Youzify < 1.0.7 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Biography

### Description

The About Me widget of the plugin does not properly sanitise its Biography field, allowing any authenticated user to set Cross-Site Scripting payloads in it, which will be executed when viewing the affected user profile. This could allow a low privilege user to gain unauthorised access to the admin side of the blog by targeting an admin, inducing them to view their profile with a malicious payload adding a rogue account for example.

### Proof of Concept

Log on as any user, go to the 'About me' widget section of your profile (https://example.com/members/<you username>/widgets/about\_me/) and set the following payload in the Biography field: <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
Then view the profile (either as yourself or any other user) to trigger the XSS (https://example.com/members/<username>/)
