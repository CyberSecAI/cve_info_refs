{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The About Me widget of the plugin does not properly sanitize its Biography field.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A low privilege user can inject malicious JavaScript into the Biography field, which will be executed when viewing the affected user profile. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the admin side of the blog by targeting an admin user and inducing them to view their profile. For example, a rogue administrator account can be added.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user can set the malicious XSS payload in their Biography field. This payload is then triggered when any user, including the victim, views the profile.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site."
