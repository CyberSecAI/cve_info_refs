- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize the `postid` parameter within the `pvc_stats` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view the page containing the crafted shortcode. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting a malicious `pvc_stats` shortcode with a crafted `postid` parameter into a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Contributor level access is sufficient to create a post with the malicious shortcode. For the XSS to be triggered on the frontend, the post needs to be approved by an administrator, unless the user has higher privileges like an editor, in which case no approval is required, even if unfiltered\_html is disallowed.
