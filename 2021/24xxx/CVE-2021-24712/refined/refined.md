- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize values used when creating new calendars.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the calendar name field, which will then be executed when a user views a page where the calendar information is displayed. This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker must be authenticated with the ability to create and edit calendars.
    - The attacker inserts a malicious XSS payload into the "new calendar name" field.
    - The XSS payload is triggered when a user views the page containing the calendar information, specifically when selecting "Publish" for any calendar.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have an account with the capability to create calendars within the WordPress plugin.
