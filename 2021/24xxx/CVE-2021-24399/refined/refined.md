Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24399:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization, escaping, or validation of the `area_id` parameter within the `check_order` function of "The Sorter" WordPress plugin. This parameter is directly inserted into a SQL query without any checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, as the unsanitized `area_id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Retrieve sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data within the database.
    - Potentially gain control of the server by exploiting further vulnerabilities that may arise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the WordPress admin interface, specifically targeting the `admin.php` page with the `page=the_sorter_areas` parameter. The vulnerable `area_id` parameter is included in the query string.
- The PoC demonstrates the injection with a `SLEEP` function to confirm the time-based SQLi.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress website.
- The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint within the WordPress admin area.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected plugin is "The Sorter" version 1.0 and likely lower versions as mentioned in Codevigilant.
- The vulnerable code is located in `items.php` at line 218, where the `area_id` parameter is directly used in the SQL query:
`$select_query = $wpdb->get_row( "SELECT * FROM " . SORTER_TB_ITEMS . " WHERE area_id = " . $_POST['area_id'] . " ORDER BY item_order DESC" );`
-  The vulnerability is classified as OWASP A1: Injection and CWE-89.
- CVSS score of 6.7 (Medium)
