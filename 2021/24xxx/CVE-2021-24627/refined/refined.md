Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24627

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization, validation, or escaping of the `id` GET parameter before it is used in an SQL query. Specifically, the plugin directly incorporates the user-supplied `id` parameter into the SQL query without any checks.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw caused by the unsanitized input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete database records.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on database configurations, the attacker could potentially escalate privileges within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious GET request to `wp-admin/admin.php?page=g-auto-hyperlink-edit` and injects SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges to access the vulnerable plugin's admin page and trigger the SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Code:** The following line in `g-auto-hyperlink.php` is vulnerable:
  ```php
  $id = $_GET['id'];
  $result = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT * FROM $table WHERE id = $id");
  ```
- **Exploit Example:** A sample exploit URL is provided:
  `GET /wp-admin/admin.php?page=g-auto-hyperlink-edit&id=-2198+UNION+ALL+SELECT+NULL%2Ccurrent_user%28%29%2Ccurrent_user%28%29%2Ccurrent_user%28%29%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CNULL--+- HTTP/1.1`
  This URL shows an example of using a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to extract the current database user.
- **SQLMap:** The information shows a `sqlmap` command that can be used to automatically test and exploit the vulnerability: `sqlmap -r hyperlink.req --dbms mysql --current-user --current-db -b -p id --batch --flush-session`

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin's vulnerable version is 1.0.1 and possibly lower versions.
- The vulnerability was identified by Shreya Pohekar from Codevigilant.
- The plugin has been closed and no known fix is available, making users vulnerable.
- The provided CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium).
