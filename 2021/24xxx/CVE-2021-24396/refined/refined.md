Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24396:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization, escaping, or validation of the `pageid` GET parameter before it's used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `pageid` parameter is directly concatenated into a SQL query without any sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin fails to validate and sanitize user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** A successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to read sensitive data, modify data, or even take complete control of the database.
- **Unauthorized access:** Attackers could potentially escalate privileges, bypass authentication mechanisms, and compromise the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/wp-admin/admin.php`. The `pageid` parameter is used to inject the malicious SQL code.
- **Direct Parameter Injection:** The vulnerable `pageid` parameter is directly manipulated by injecting SQL code

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator Level Access:** The attacker requires administrator-level privileges on the WordPress site to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Knowledge of Plugin and Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable plugin (`gseor`) and the vulnerable endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gseor.php`).
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft HTTP requests containing the malicious payload

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerable code is found in `/gseor.php` at line 457.
   ```php
   $pages_db = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE id = ".$_GET["pageid"]." ORDER BY id DESC");
   ```
- **Exploit Payload Example:** The provided exploit uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique using the following payload:
  ```
  page=gseor.php&search=1&pageid=1 AND (SELECT 6449 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))wwdQ)
  ```
