- ### Amazing, Must-have for WP Site security

  My small business WP Site got hacked (built, installed and maintained by me) and a cryptocurrency miner was hidden somewhere in my code.

  I spent a week trying to eliminate that code, and my Host also looked for it, without success, meanwhile I looked like a jerk trying to mine cryptocurrency from clients and potential clients!

  I tried several other WP security plugins, and web scan sites, but none could find or fix my problem.

  I downloaded and installed Wordfence, it found and repaired my problem in less than 5 minutes!

  I’ve since enabled many of its additional features and have been stunned to learn just how many attempts there are daily to log into my page! No wonder it got hacked. Some jerk even set up a new username for himself!

  Anyhow, I’ll never have any other WP page without Wordfence, and neither should you!

  Amazing plugin, very simple and very powerful.

- ### Best Money I Spend!

  Wordfence is by far the best and most important plug-in I have installed on every site I maintain. The free version is good, but the premium version is worth every penny and more. In fact, I refuse to create or maintain a site without it.

- ### Excellent support and the best security plugin

  We have been using Wordfence (free version) for years on all our 100+ WordPress websites. We haven’t had any hacked websites since then. Just recently we purchased the premium license to increase the security of our websites even more. We had some questions regarding a multi WP install on the same domain in various subfolders and received timely and professional support within a day. Everything is setup properly now and we sleep quietly at night knowing that it’s all secured.

- ### Wordfence site-cleaning team saved my client big time

  I’ve have the Wordfence plugin (free version) on dozens of my personal and client sites for a few years. Easy to install and configure, it’s blocked many attacks and I’ve never had a site hacked that had it. On one client site, we didn’t use it, they got hacked and it was nasty, they sell tickets to their events and their payment system stopped taking payments (and gave some customers virus/malware).

  Not just one site, but the client’s entire hosting account was infected. I contacted Wordfence for a site cleaning and they got on it right away. In two days, the site was cleaned and taking payments again. Wordfence running on the sites after the cleaning reported a malware backdoor in my wptwin site-cloning script. I sent the report and the wptwin.php script to the security analyst who cleaned the site and within a few hours, he replied that indeed this was a false positive. That was great service and set me at ease that the client’s site had not become re-infected.

- ### Awesome

  Wordfence is my favourite WordPress plugin. Immediately installed on all my client’s sites. Saved my bacon numerous times.

- ### Wordfence is the best!

  I’ve been using Wordfence for some time now on 6 of my sites. It works extremely well and provides me with the protection from intruders that I need. I’ve only had a couple of minor issues, mostly caused by my lack of experience, but the support at Wordfence has been great at helping me out of a jam. I highly recommend the plugin, and purchasing the upgrade to the pro version is worth every penny. The plugin is easy to install and setup is simple. And.. if your host is GoDaddy, it is one of their recommended plugin partners.

- ### Awesome Plugin and Premium Support

  Wordfence Premium has provided excellent customer service. The plugin is easy to use, and the premium support is friendly and informative. Very happy with their service.

- ### Thank you very much for providing such a good plugin and service

  Having researched and trialed various security plugins Wordfence wins hands down each time. All our websites are running Wordfence Premium and this plugin has served us very well for several years and the support team are second to none. As a small business there are an array of tasks to take care of and it is a very small price to pay for Wordfence Premium to take care of an extremely important task and is worth every penny.

  A reliable security plugin is paramount but it goes without saying this must be backed up by a good technical support team who can assist you when there is a problem. The Wordfence technical support goes beyond the call of duty and their knowledge is very reassuring when things go awry with your website.

  Phil provided an excellent service giving us the confidence we are with the right people who really know what they are doing and can explain and assist in a very succinct, knowledgeable and helpful manner.

  Having numerous plugins running on a WordPress website can result in all manner of conflicts, never mind issues that maybe caused by the hosting services used which can be a nightmare to unravel without the right technical support at hand.

  Wordfence not only protects your website from being hacked but provides a wealth of advice and excellent technical support when needed. Thank you very much for providing such a good service.

- ### Wordfence review

  Wordfence is a top-notch plugin, even the free version has tons on functions. I strongly recommend it for not only the newbie web-designer but also the experienced one as well. It is undoubtedly a great product.

- ### Fantastic Support – The Best Solution for a Hacked Website

  If you know the horror of having your website hacked, you know the mountain of stress that comes with it. Even worse is trying to find a solution to fix your hacked website for a reasonable price without being overly sold to. This is where WordFence comes in to save the day.

  They very quickly and thoroughly fixed my hacked website, keeping me updated with the status at all times. I also received a long report detailing what was hacked, how it was fixed, and instructions to secure my website from future hacks. In a matter of days, my site was unblacklisted by Google and I’m back in business!

  While I can’t yet speak to how well WordFence secures your website from hacks, I can say that they have been the best solution for fixing my hacked website. Based on that experience, I have no problem entrusting them with securing my website going forward.

  THANK YOU WORDFENCE! It was worth every penny.

## Themes Vulnerabilities

# All Thrive Themes Legacy Themes < 2.0.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload and Option Deletion

### Description

Thrive “Legacy” themes register a REST API endpoint to compress images using the Kraken image optimization engine. By supplying a crafted request in combination with data inserted using the Option Update vulnerability, it was possible to use this endpoint to retrieve malicious code from a remote URL and overwrite an existing file on the site with it or create a new file.This includes executable PHP files that contain malicious code.

By supplying a crafted request in combination with data inserted using the Option Update vulnerability, it was possible to use this endpoint to retrieve malicious code from a remote URL and overwrite an existing file on the site with it or create a new file.This includes executable PHP files that contain malicious code.

# Recently Patched Vulnerability in Thrive Themes Actively Exploited in the Wild

On March 23, 2021, the Wordfence Threat Intelligence Team discovered two recently patched vulnerabilities being actively exploited in [Thrive Theme’s](https://thrivethemes.com/) “Legacy” Themes and Thrive Theme plugins that were chained together to allow unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on vulnerable WordPress sites. We estimate that more than 100,000 WordPress sites are using Thrive Theme products that may still be vulnerable.

Patches were released on March 12, 2021 for the vulnerable themes and plugins. We are seeing these vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the wild, and we urge users to update to the latest versions available immediately since they contain a patch for these vulnerabilities.

We strongly recommend updating if you are running any of the following versions:

* All Legacy Themes, including Rise, Ignition, and others | Version < 2.0.0
* Thrive Optimize | Version < 1.4.13.3
* Thrive Comments | Version < 1.4.15.3
* Thrive Headline Optimizer | Version < 1.3.7.3
* Thrive Themes Builder | Version < 2.2.4
* Thrive Leads Version | < 2.3.9.4
* Thrive Ultimatum Version | < 2.3.9.4
* Thrive Quiz Builder Version | < 2.3.9.4
* Thrive Apprentice | Version < 2.3.9.4
* Thrive Architect | Version < 2.6.7.4
* Thrive Dashboard | Version < 2.3.9.3
* Thrive Ovation | Version < 2.4.5
* Thrive Clever Widgets | Version < 1.56.1

Wordfence Premium customers received two rules on March 23, 2021 to protect against active exploitation of this vulnerability. Wordfence users still using the free version will receive the same protection on April 22, 2021.

**Description:** Unauthenticated Option Update

**Affected Plugins:** All Thrive Theme Plugins and Themes

**Plugin Slugs:** thrive-ab-page-testing, thrive-comments, thrive-headline-optimizer, thrive-visual-editor, thrive-leads, thrive-ultimatum, thrive-quiz-builder, thrive-apprentice, thrive-architect, thrive-dashboard, thrive-ovation, thrive-clever-widgets

**Affected Versions of Plugins:** Various [please see above for affected versions]

**Fully Patched Version of Plugins:** Various [please see above for patched versions]

**Fully Patched Version of Themes:** 2.0.0

Thrive Themes offers a variety of products designed to enhance the site building process. One feature that these products offer in the Thrive Dashboard is the ability to integrate with Zapier. Unfortunately, this functionality was insecurely implemented.

Thrive Themes products register a REST API endpoint associated with Zapier functionality. While this endpoint was intended to require an API key in order to access, it was possible to access it by supplying an empty `api_key` parameter in vulnerable versions if Zapier was not enabled. Attackers could use this endpoint to add arbitrary data to a predefined option in the `wp_options` table.

**Description:** Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload and Option Deletion

**Affected Themes:** All Thrive Themes Legacy Themes

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.0.0

Thrive Themes “Legacy” themes offer the ability to automatically compress images during all uploads. Unfortunately, this functionality was insecurely implemented as well.

Thrive “Legacy” Themes register a REST API endpoint to compress images using the Kraken image optimization engine. By supplying a crafted request in combination with data inserted using the Option Update vulnerability, it was possible to use this endpoint to retrieve malicious code from a remote URL and overwrite an existing file on the site with it or create a new file. This includes executable PHP files that contain malicious code.

## Chaining Exploits Together

We’ve seen cases in the past where attackers chain two separate exploits in order to gain access to a site and that was the case with this exploit.

Attackers are using the Unauthenticated Option Update vulnerability to update an option in the database that can then be used by the Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability to upload a malicious PHP file. The combination of these two vulnerabilities is allowing attackers to gain backdoor access into vulnerable sites to further compromise them

## Indicators of Compromise

Our security analysts have been able to forensically verify this intrusion vector on an individual site. In addition, we have found the payload added by this attack on over 1900 sites, all of which appear to have vulnerable REST API endpoints. We will update this section as we discover new information.

**Modified and Malicious Files**

* `/signup.php` – We are seeing this file in the webroot of compromised sites, and it appears to be a backdoor used to further infect sites. While we’re seeing a few variants, the vast majority of these have an MD5 hash of `d8ef979fc3aac9dabb0883cb5be4b345`
* A small number of infected sites also have an additional malicious client.php or `wp-includes/client.php` file included from a modification to `wp-load.php`. In some sites this appears to be used to inject spam. The following MD5 hashes are prevalent on these sites:
  + `4f737679c8e660c4883b2d0bddc6cb77`
  + `2004feca39133a7034893ce7ef6f6b25`

**Offending IP Addresses**

* 5.255.176.41

**Log Files**

Here are the extracted contents of a log file from a site that was compromised by this chain of vulnerabilities. It is easy to observe the attack step by step while reviewing these log files. Keep an eye out for similar log entries if your site has been compromised recently.

## Response Timeline

**March 23, 2021 1:03 PM UTC –** Charles Sweethill, Wordfence Security Analyst, notifies the Threat Intelligence team of evidence indicating the possibility of a critical vulnerability in Thrive Themes being actively exploited. An investigation begins.

**March 23, 2021 5:11 PM UTC –** We discover one of the vulnerable API endpoints.

**March 23, 2021 5:38 PM UTC –** We obtain a vulnerable copy of one of the Thrive Themes, and confirm that the `thrive_kraken_callback()` function is vulnerable to arbitrary file creation.

**March 23, 2021 6:07 PM UTC –** We discover the second vulnerable API endpoint needed in order to exploit the first API endpoint.

**March 23, 2021 6:36 PM UTC –** We verify that the `subscribe()` function is vulnerable to unauthenticated options change that can be used to exploit the vulnerability in the `thrive_kraken_callback()` function.

**March 23, 2021 7:01 PM UTC –** We create a working proof of concept and firewall rule development begins.

**March 23, 2021 10:16 PM UTC –** Testing on the first firewall rule for the unauthenticated options change is complete and the rule is released to Wordfence Premium users.

**March 23, 2021 10:26 PM UTC –** Testing on the second firewall rule for the unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability is complete and the rule is released to Wordfence Premium users.

**April 22, 2021 –** Wordfence free users receive the same protection.

## Conclusion

We have intentionally provided minimal details in this post in an attempt to keep exploitation to a minimum while also informing WordPress site owners using affected Thrive Theme products of this active campaign. We will release a follow-up post with further details once active exploitation ceases.

For the time being, we urge that site owners running any of the Thrive Themes “legacy” themes to update to version 2.0.0 immediately, and any site owners running any of the Thrive plugins to update to the latest version available for each of the respective plugins.

[Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/?promo_id=blog20210324&promo_name=get-premium&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=conclusion) customers have been protected from attacks against this vulnerability since March 23, 2021. Sites running the free version of Wordfence will receive the firewall rule update on April 22, 2021.

Our team is actively tracking attacks, and we will produce more details as soon as we believe it is responsible to do so. For updates, please consider subscribing to our newsletter, and please consider sharing this post to help create awareness of this security issue.

*Special thanks to Wordfence Security Analyst Charles Sweethill for quickly identifying these vulnerabilities during a site cleaning, pinpointing the REST API endpoints used to compromise vulnerable sites, and for his contributions on this post. Also, huge thanks to Wordfence Threat Analyst Ramuel Gall for his work reverse engineering both vulnerabilities and attack data, creating a working proof of concept, writing the firewall rules to protect Wordfence customers, and his contributions to this post. This research and the resulting protection for Wordfence customers is truly a team effort.*

  Hi Salvador,

  I really appreciate that, but I must say it is the *entire* Wordfence team that is on fire. :) I am sorry to hear your sites were affected by this, I recommend following [this guide](https://www.wordfence.com/docs/how-to-clean-a-hacked-wordpress-site-using-wordfence/) to clean up your site to make sure nothing goes missed.

  Thanks again!

  Hi. Thanks so much for all the security work you guys do. I've gone in and updated what I can. However, when I tried to update my themes Ignition and Rise (I'm using it on 2 sites still), it went from version 2.0.0 back to version 1.510. Now there is still a message to update for 2.0.1 but every time I try, it says it's successful but it doesn't clear from the updates page in WordPress. Should I be concerned about this?

  Hi Susie,

  That is very odd, and I am sorry to hear that is happening! I would recommend reaching out to their support team directly for their assistance on trying to get that updated for you. It looks like you can get in touch with them here: <https://thrivethemes.com/support/>

## Themes Vulnerabilities

# All Thrive Themes Legacy Themes < 2.0.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload and Option Deletion

### Description

Thrive “Legacy” themes register a REST API endpoint to compress images using the Kraken image optimization engine. By supplying a crafted request in combination with data inserted using the Option Update vulnerability, it was possible to use this endpoint to retrieve malicious code from a remote URL and overwrite an existing file on the site with it or create a new file.This includes executable PHP files that contain malicious code.

### Proof of Concept
