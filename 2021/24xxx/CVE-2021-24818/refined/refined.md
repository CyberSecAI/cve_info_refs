Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24818:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the WP Limits plugin when saving its settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The plugin fails to implement proper CSRF checks, allowing an attacker to forge requests that can modify the plugin's settings on behalf of a logged-in administrator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the plugin settings by tricking a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted request. This can lead to:
  - Instability of the blog by setting low values for memory or time limits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious website or email containing a crafted HTML form that automatically submits a POST request to the vulnerable plugin's settings page.
- The attacker doesn't need direct access to the WordPress admin panel but relies on a logged-in admin to unknowingly trigger the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create a malicious web page or email containing the crafted HTML form.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target WordPress site but needs to target a user that is logged in as admin.
- The attacker has to trick the administrator to visit the malicious site or open the email.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Proof of Concept code clearly demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited by setting various limits to low values.
- The vulnerable plugin is "wp-limits" version 1.0 and prior.
- The provided CVSS score is 5.4 (Medium), which reflects that the vulnerability requires user interaction.
