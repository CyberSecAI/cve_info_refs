The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24733.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control within the WP Post Page Clone plugin. Specifically, users with the "Contributor" role, which has limited permissions, are able to clone and access draft and password-protected posts belonging to other users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly enforce access control restrictions, allowing lower-privileged users to access content they should not have permission to view.
- **Unauthorized Post Access:**  Contributors can view content (drafts and password-protected posts) from other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view the content of draft and password-protected posts belonging to other users which can contain sensitive data, intellectual property or other confidential content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by navigating to the "All Posts" section, locating the post intended for cloning, and utilizing the "Click to Clone" feature. The cloned post can then be edited to view its content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least the "Contributor" role.
- The attacker needs to be logged into the WordPress instance where the vulnerable plugin is active.
