## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# AddToAny < 1.7.46 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise its Sharing Header setting when outputting it in frontend pages, allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the Sharing Header setting of the plugin: <svg onload=alert(/XSS/)>
Then go to any page in the frontend to trigger the XSS

### Affects Plugins
