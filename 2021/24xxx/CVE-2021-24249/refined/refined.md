- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Business Directory plugin lacks proper CSRF protection when exporting listings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin doesn't validate the origin of the export request, allowing an attacker to trigger the export functionality on behalf of a logged-in administrator.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to export sensitive data, such as email and home addresses (PII), which can then be downloaded by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious HTML form that targets the vulnerable endpoint `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `wpbdp-csv-export` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious webpage or clicking a malicious link. The attacker does not need any prior authentication on the target WordPress website.
