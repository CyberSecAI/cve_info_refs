The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24849.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `wcfm_ajax_controller` AJAX action within the WCFM - WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace plugin not properly sanitizing multiple parameters before using them in SQL statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection (SQLI) due to inadequate input sanitization. Specifically, the `transaction_id` and `orderby` parameters are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to sensitive data extraction, modification, or deletion, potentially causing significant damage or unauthorized access to the database. The provided example demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection where the attacker can cause delays using `SLEEP()` to confirm SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `wcfm_ajax_controller`. The vulnerable parameters are `transaction_id` and `orderby` within the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users. The attacker does not need any specific privileges or prior knowledge of the system, as the vulnerable AJAX endpoint is accessible to the public.
