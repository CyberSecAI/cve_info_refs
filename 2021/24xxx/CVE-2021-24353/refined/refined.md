Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24353:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `import_data` function within the Simple 301 Redirects plugin was registered with the `admin_init` action hook. This hook allows the function to be triggered via the `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` endpoint, which is accessible to both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
*   The `import_data` function lacked both capability and nonce checks, meaning that no authorization or security verification was performed before executing the function. This allowed anyone to call the function and supply arbitrary data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability stems from the absence of proper access control on the `import_data` function.
*   **Missing Capability Checks:** The function does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the redirect import.
*   **Missing Nonce Checks:** The function doesn't validate a nonce to verify the authenticity and integrity of the request.
*  **Insecure implementation of the import/export functionality**: the functionality was not properly secured by authorization checks and nonce verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could use the `import_data` function to import a list of redirects.
*   This allows for **total site redirection** by redirecting all site traffic to an external malicious site.
*   This can result in a loss of availability for the legitimate site and redirect users to malicious sites which can further infect the user's computers.
*   An attacker can perform a denial-of-service by redirecting traffic to an invalid location.
*   Exposure of sensitive information via the `export_data` function, although this was deemed less severe.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request** to the `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker manipulates the `page` and `import` GET parameters, along with the `upload_file` POST parameter, to specify the target function and the content of the import file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable site.

**Additional Notes**

* The Wordfence article provides a more in-depth explanation of the vulnerability and the vulnerable code.
* The `wpscan.com` content provides a proof of concept using a curl command.
