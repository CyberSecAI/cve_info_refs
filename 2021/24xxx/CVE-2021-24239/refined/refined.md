Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Pie Register plugin failed to properly sanitize the `invitaion_code` GET parameter before displaying it on the "Activation Code" page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This occurs because the plugin directly outputs the unsanitized `invitaion_code` parameter within the HTML content of the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `invitaion_code` parameter.
*   When a user visits the crafted URL, the attacker's script will execute in the user's browser.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the `invitaion_code` parameter in the URL.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a crafted URL containing the malicious payload. This could be achieved via phishing or other social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges or authentication.
*   The attacker only needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious `invitaion_code` parameter and convince a user to click it.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerable code was located in `pie-register/trunk/pie-register.php`.
*   The vulnerable line was where the invitation code was echoed: `<h2><?php \_e("Activation Code","pie-register");echo " : ".$inv\_code; ?></h2>`.
*   The fix involved sanitizing the output using `esc_html()` to prevent the execution of HTML or javascript code. The fixed code is `<h2><?php \_e("Activation Code","pie-register");echo " : ".esc\_html($inv\_code); ?></h2>`.
*   The vulnerable version was less than 3.7.0.1, and the vulnerability was fixed in version 3.7.0.1.
*   The `wpscan.com` content includes a proof of concept URL that demonstrates the vulnerability.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The provided CVSS score is 7.1 (High), with the vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L`.

In summary, the vulnerability is a classic reflected XSS caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user input in the `invitaion_code` GET parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
