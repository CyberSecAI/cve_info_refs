- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin `navz-photo-gallery` fails to sanitize and escape the `post` parameter in the `includes/acf_photo_gallery_metabox_edit.php` file before outputting it within an HTML attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with the payload in the `post` parameter, which is then reflected in the HTML output.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking the link.
