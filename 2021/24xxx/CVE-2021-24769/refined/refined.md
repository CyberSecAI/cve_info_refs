Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24769:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the `orderby` parameter within the Permalink Manager plugin before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically within the `orderby` parameter when querying the database. The plugin does not sanitize the input, making it vulnerable.
- **CWE-89:** This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-89, which refers to "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries.
- The CVSS score of 6.8 (Medium) indicates potential for significant compromise.
- Although the specific impact is not detailed here it is common for SQL injection to allow attackers to read/write database information, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification, or service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via the `orderby` parameter in the `tools.php?page=permalink-manager` URL within the WordPress admin panel.
- A proof-of-concept URL is provided:  `https://example.com/wp-admin/tools.php?page=permalink-manager&orderby=ID+AND+(SELECT+9480+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))EXid)`
