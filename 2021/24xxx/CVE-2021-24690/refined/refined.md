- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape inputs in the plugin's settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the plugin's settings page. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting a malicious payload into the "title" field under "Chained Quiz > Social Sharing" in the WP admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the WordPress admin panel to modify plugin settings.
