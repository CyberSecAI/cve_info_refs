- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated users to disable the plugin, removing the security protections it offers.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
