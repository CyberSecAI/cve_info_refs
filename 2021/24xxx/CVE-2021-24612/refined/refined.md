The provided content relates to CVE-2021-24612.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Sociable plugin fails to sanitize or escape some of its settings before displaying them in the admin dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:** A high-privilege user (Admin+) can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the admin dashboard. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities. The vulnerability can be exploited even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

**Attack Vectors:** The attacker must have admin-level privileges or higher and can inject the malicious payload via the plugin's settings page (/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=skyscraper\_options), specifically in the "Background Color" or "Labels Color" fields of the Skyscraper settings. Other settings may also be affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be logged in as a user with administrative privileges or higher.
