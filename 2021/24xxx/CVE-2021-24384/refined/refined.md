Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `joomsport_md_load` AJAX action within the JoomSport plugin. This action, accessible to both authenticated and unauthenticated users, deserializes user-supplied input from the `shattr` POST parameter using `unserialize()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The core vulnerability is a PHP Object Injection flaw due to the insecure use of `unserialize()` on user-provided data. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application's memory.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable AJAX action is accessible to unauthenticated users, increasing the attack surface and making it easier to exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While the JoomSport plugin itself may not have a direct "gadget chain" to trigger RCE, other installed plugins or the WordPress core might contain suitable classes. If a suitable gadget chain is present, exploitation could lead to RCE, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Other potential impacts:** Depending on the available classes, exploitation could potentially lead to data manipulation, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **`shattr` parameter:** The serialized payload is included in the `shattr` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must know to send the serialized data in the `shattr` POST parameter, as well as the name of the vulnerable AJAX action (`joomsport_md_load`).

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Plugin:** The vulnerability affects the JoomSport plugin, specifically versions prior to 5.1.8.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5 (Medium).
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.1.8 of the JoomSport plugin. Users should update to this version as soon as possible.
- **OWASP:** The vulnerability is classified as "Insecure Deserialization" in the OWASP Top 10.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data).
