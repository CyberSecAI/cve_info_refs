Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is related to CVE-2021-24405:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The WordPress plugin "Easy Cookie Policy" lacks proper authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks when saving its settings.
*   The plugin fails to sanitize or validate the cookie banner settings before outputting them on the front end and back end settings pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Broken Access Control (Missing Authorization):** Any authenticated user, including subscribers (users with the lowest privileges), can change the plugin's settings. This bypasses intended access restrictions.
*   **CSRF:** If user registration is disabled, an attacker can still modify the settings through CSRF attacks.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The cookie banner settings are not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of site visitors when they load pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution in browser:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to arbitrary code execution in the browsers of users who visit the affected website. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, and other malicious activities.
*   **Website compromise:** By injecting malicious code, an attacker could potentially gain administrative control over the WordPress site.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance or functionality of the website.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
*   **HTTP POST request:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **CSRF:** If user registrations are not allowed on the website, an attacker can use Cross Site Request Forgery to make the user perform the request

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site (even with minimal privileges, such as a subscriber) to directly exploit the authorization bypass.
*   **OR CSRF exploit:** If no user registration is enabled, the attacker has to forge a CSRF request.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the target website to send the malicious HTTP requests.
