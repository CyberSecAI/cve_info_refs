Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24243:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder Clipboard plugin. This action lacked both capability checks and sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. User-provided input in the "email" and "license_key" parameters of the AJAX action was not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a low-privileged user (subscriber+) can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the WordPress backend, enabling them to potentially perform malicious actions on behalf of these users.
- **Account Compromise:** Depending on the code injected, attackers could potentially take over admin accounts, modify content, inject backdoors, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Malicious Payload:** The payload is injected via the `email` and `license_key` parameters of the POST request.
- **AJAX Action:** The specific AJAX action that is exploited is `vc_clipboard_activate`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privilege Access:** The attacker requires minimal access - a user with subscriber-level privileges (or higher) on the WordPress site can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress site's `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.5.6 of the plugin by sanitizing the parameters.
- A related vulnerability related to unauthorized option updates by subscriber+ users was fixed in version 4.5.8.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.9, categorized as critical.
