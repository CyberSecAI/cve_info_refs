Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly validate and escape the `bulkcheck` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLI): The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, specifically due to the unsanitized `bulkcheck` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided CVSS score indicates a "Medium" severity with a score of 6.8. The exploit allows a high privileged user (Admin+) to perform malicious database operations. This could potentially lead to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service due to the direct interaction with the database via the injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the WordPress admin panel, specifically when managing the `quotes-collection` plugin page.
- The attack vector is the `bulkcheck` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or have admin privileges to access the vulnerable functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious SQL payload and insert it in the `bulkcheck` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject SQL code using the `bulkcheck` parameter.
- The affected plugin is `quotes-collection` and versions up to and including 2.5.2 are vulnerable.
- There is no known fix for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-89, which is Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').
- The vulnerability is mapped to OWASP Top 10 - A1: Injection
