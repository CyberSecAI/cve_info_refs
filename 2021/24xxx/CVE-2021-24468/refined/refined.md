- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Leaflet Map plugin does not properly escape shortcode attributes before using them in JavaScript code or HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Unescaped shortcode attributes allow execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who view the page containing the crafted shortcode. This can lead to various malicious activities, including data theft, session hijacking, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: By inserting malicious shortcode attributes into a page or post via a vulnerable shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to a WordPress site to be able to add or modify content containing the vulnerable shortcode with malicious attributes.
