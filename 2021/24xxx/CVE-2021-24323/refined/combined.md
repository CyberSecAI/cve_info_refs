## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Woocommerce < 5.2.0 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

When taxes are enabled, the "Additional tax classes" field was not properly sanitised or escaped before being output back in the admin dashboard, allowing high privilege users such as admin to use XSS payloads even when the unfiltered\_html is disabled

### Proof of Concept

Enable taxes (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=general), then put the payload below in the "Additional tax classes" field (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=tax)
<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
