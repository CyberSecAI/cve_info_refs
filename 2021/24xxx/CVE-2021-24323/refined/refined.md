- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "Additional tax classes" field within the WooCommerce plugin's settings page did not properly sanitize or escape user-provided input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they visit the affected admin page. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with high privileges would need to navigate to the tax settings page in the WooCommerce admin panel, and input a malicious script into the "Additional tax classes" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or other high privilege level access to the WordPress dashboard.
