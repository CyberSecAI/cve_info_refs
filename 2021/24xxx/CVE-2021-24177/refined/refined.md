{
  "CVE-2021-24177": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress plugin WP File Manager versions 7.0 and below does not properly sanitize the User-Agent HTTP header before reflecting it back in the response.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to actions such as stealing cookies, modifying the web page, capturing clipboard contents, keylogging, or other malicious attacks. Successful exploitation requires user interaction, specifically targeting administrator users who access the vulnerable page.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp_file_manager_properties` with malicious JavaScript code in the `User-Agent` header. This payload is then reflected back in the response, executing the script in the user's browser context.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator user into visiting a crafted URL with the malicious `User-Agent` header.  The targeted administrator must have access to the plugin configuration page `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp_file_manager_properties`."
