- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Data Id setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** High privilege users can perform XSS attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting a malicious payload into the Data ID setting of the plugin via the admin interface. Specifically, `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=tlsa_audit&page=tlsa_settings`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (Admin+) to access the plugin settings.
