{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `iframe-font-preview.php` file of the titan-framework does not properly escape the `font-weight` and `font-family` GET parameters before outputting them back in an href attribute.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL with specific values for the `font-weight` and `font-family` GET parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a victim. The victim must then click the link while logged into the WordPress admin panel or while interacting with the vulnerable plugin on the frontend."
