![Jetpack New Release](https://jetpack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5-v2_preview1.png?w=850)
# Jetpack 9.8: Engage your audience with WordPress Stories

Updated on July 7, 2023 - Sami Falah

At Jetpack, we are continuously working to develop a better product for you and your website. This month, we bring the popular Story Block to the web editor, a feature previously exclusive to mobile. This release also includes a fix for a security vulnerability for the Carousel feature.

**We consequently encourage you to update all sites that you administer as soon as possible.**

## Security update for all sites using the Carousel feature

We found a vulnerability in the Carousel feature and its option to display comments for each image. Thank you to nguyenhg\_vcs for disclosing this issue to us in a responsible manner.

We have no evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild. However, now that the update has been released, it is only a matter of time before someone tries to take advantage of this vulnerability.

We consequently invite you to update your version of Jetpack as soon as possible. To help you in this process, we worked with the WordPress.org Security Team to release patched versions of every version of Jetpack since 2.0. Most websites have been or will soon be automatically updated to a secured version.

Versions released today include 2.0.8, 2.1.6, 2.2.9, 2.3.9, 2.4.6, 2.5.4, 2.6.5, 2.7.4, 2.8.4, 2.9.5, 3.0.5, 3.1.4, 3.2.4, 3.3.5, 3.4.5, 3.5.5, 3.6.3, 3.7.4, 3.8.4, 3.9.8, 4.0.5, 4.1.2, 4.2.3, 4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.5.1, 4.6.1, 4.7.2, 4.8.3, 4.9.1, 5.0.1, 5.1.2, 5.2.3, 5.3.2, 5.4.2, 5.5.3, 5.6.3, 5.7.3, 5.8.2, 5.9.2, 6.0.2, 6.1.3, 6.2.3, 6.3.5, 6.4.4, 6.5.2, 6.6.3, 6.7.2, 6.8.3, 6.9.2, 7.0.3, 7.1.3, 7.2.3, 7.3.3, 7.4.3, 7.5.5, 7.6.2, 7.7.4, 7.8.2, 7.9.2, 8.0.1, 8.1.2, 8.2.4, 8.3.1, 8.4.3, 8.5.1, 8.6.2, 8.7.2, 8.8.3, 8.9.2, 9.0.3, 9.1.1, 9.2.2, 9.3.3, 9.4.2, 9.5.3, 9.6.2, 9.7.1.

If you are running any of these versions, your website is not vulnerable to this issue.

## Publish WordPress Stories on the web

With Jetpack 9.8, we make it easier for you to engage with your audience via WordPress Stories by bringing the Story Block to the web block editor.

Stories have become a powerful way to engage audiences on social media. With WordPress Stories, you can combine photos, videos, and text to create an engaging, tappable, full-screen slideshow that your visitors will love. Previously only available on mobile, you can now compose and share beautiful stories within the web block editor.

   If a site is running an older version, but not using the carousel feature, is it still vulnerable to this issue?

     You can rest assured: if the Carousel feature is disabled, your site is not vulnerable to this issue.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Jetpack < 9.8 - Carousel Module Non-Published Page/Post Attachment Comment Leak

### Description

The Jetpack Carousel module allows users to create a "carousel" type image gallery and allows users to comment on the images.

A security vulnerability was found within the Jetpack Carousel module by nguyenhg\_vcs that allowed the comments of non-published page/posts to be leaked.

Please refer to the Proof of Concept (PoC) of this vulnerability for further technical details.

### Proof of Concept

By changing the "id" parameter of the POST request to a valid media attachment id on a page/post that was not public, it was possible to leak the non-public comments.
http://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get\_attachment\_comments&nonce=4aadefa6ee&id=28&offset=0
