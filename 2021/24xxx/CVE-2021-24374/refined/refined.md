Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Jetpack Carousel module, specifically in how it handles comments for images. The issue stems from the lack of proper access control when fetching comments associated with media attachments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability is classified as an IDOR, which means that the system fails to properly authorize access to resources based on user identity or permissions.
- **Broken Access Control:** This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive data that should be restricted.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leak comments associated with non-published pages/posts by manipulating the "id" parameter in the `get_attachment_comments` AJAX request. This reveals potentially private comments that are not meant to be publicly accessible.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request Manipulation:** By crafting a specific POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a modified `id` parameter that corresponds to a media attachment on a non-public page/post, an attacker can retrieve the comments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges on the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Attachment IDs:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess valid media attachment IDs to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target website.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was disclosed by nguyenhg_vcs.
- Patched versions of Jetpack have been released since version 2.0 to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects sites using the Carousel feature.
- If the Carousel feature is disabled the site is not vulnerable.
