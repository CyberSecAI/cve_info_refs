- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize the input in the Description field of Trip Destination/Activities/Trip Type and Pricing Category pages before displaying it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the Description field, which will then be executed in the browsers of users viewing the affected pages. This could lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to have at least editor privileges to access the vulnerable input fields. The malicious payload is injected through the Description field when creating or editing a Trip Destination/Activity/Type or Pricing Category.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an account with at least editor privileges within the WordPress installation.
