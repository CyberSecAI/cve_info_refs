- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of the slider options, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads to be injected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users, including administrators, when they view the slider list or edit the slider. This could lead to privilege escalation (e.g., creation of rogue admin account).
- **Attack vectors:** By creating a slider with a malicious payload in the slider title (or other vulnerable slider options). The XSS payload is then triggered when an administrator views the list of sliders or edits the affected slider.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a user account with subscriber privileges or higher, as any authenticated user is allowed to create sliders by default.
