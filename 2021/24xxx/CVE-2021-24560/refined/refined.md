- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape the `edit_record` parameter before outputting it in the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `edit_record` parameter and tricking a user into clicking it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and persuade a user with access to the admin dashboard to click on it.
