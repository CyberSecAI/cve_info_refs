Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within the "Fonts Plugin". Specifically, several block settings were vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to properly sanitize the following block settings, allowing the injection of malicious code:
*   `blockType` (combined with content)
*   `align`
*   `color`
*   `variant`
*   `fontID`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a web page viewed by other users. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
*   Session hijacking.
*   Defacement of the website.
*   Redirection to malicious sites.
*   Stealing sensitive user data.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin's Gutenberg block settings within WordPress posts or pages. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the vulnerable parameters when creating or editing a post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress website.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create or edit posts/pages using the WordPress editor and be able to switch to the code editor.
*   The vulnerable plugin needs to be installed and active.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided Proof of Concept code shows how an attacker could inject Javascript into `color`, `align`, `fontID` and `variant` parameters using  `animation-name` with `onanimationend` event to trigger the alert.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.0.3 of the plugin
*   The vulnerable plugin is named "olympus-google-fonts"
