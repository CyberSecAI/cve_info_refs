- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks nonce checks, allowing for CSRF attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Specifically, the plugin does not implement nonce checks when handling requests to change the "Disable Simultaneous Play" setting.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to change the "Disable Simultaneous Play" setting, potentially disrupting the intended functionality of the audio player.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML form (provided in the proof of concept) and trick a logged-in administrator into submitting it, thereby triggering the vulnerable functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted form. This can be achieved by social engineering tactics, such as embedding the form in a malicious link, website, or email.
