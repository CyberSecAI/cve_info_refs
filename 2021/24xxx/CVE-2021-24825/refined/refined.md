- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate the data passed to its `load` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary File Access / Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary files from the filesystem can be displayed (e.g., logs, .htaccess).
    - PHP files can be executed, leading to LFI.
    - Sensitive data can be accessed.
- **Attack vectors**: The `load` shortcode is used with the `dir` and `file` parameters to specify a file path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Contributor+ user (versions < 4.0.1) or Admin+ user (versions < 4.0.2) is required to exploit the vulnerability. Admin users can still exploit this vulnerability in single-site blogs if `unfiltered_html` or `file_edit` capabilities are not disallowed.
