Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin's AJAX action `spl_upload_ser_img` for uploading images lacked capability checks.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Unauthenticated arbitrary image upload: The AJAX action was accessible to unauthenticated users allowing them to upload arbitrary image files.
- Incorrect authorization: Even after the unauthenticated access was removed, the action still lacked proper authorization checks (capability and CSRF), making it exploitable by any authenticated user.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary image uploads by unauthenticated or authenticated users, potentially leading to the upload of malicious content, defacement, or other security issues.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `spl_upload_ser_img` and a `file` parameter containing the image to upload.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- For unauthenticated exploitation: No prior access or authentication is required.
- For authenticated exploitation: Access to a WordPress user account with any role is sufficient.
