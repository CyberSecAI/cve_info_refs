Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization, escaping, or validation of the `editid` parameter before it is used in a SQL query. This allows for arbitrary SQL code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLi).  The `editid` parameter from the POST request is directly included in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary SQL execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, leading to potential data breaches, data modification, or denial of service.
* **Data exfiltration:** Attackers could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint.
* **`editid` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `editid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator on the WordPress site to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Technical Details:**
* **Vulnerable File:** `/wp-domain-redirect.php` at line 41.
* **Vulnerable Code:**
```php
$countryIds = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE `country_id` =". $country_id ." AND id <>".$_POST['editid']);
```
*   The `$_POST['editid']` is directly included in the SQL query without any sanitization.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject SQL code using the `editid` parameter, including a time-based blind SQL injection using `SLEEP()`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is in the `wp-domain-redirect` plugin, version 1.0 and potentially lower versions.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Syed Sheeraz Ali.
*   The plugin was closed after the vulnerability was disclosed.
*   The provided `sqlmap` output confirms the SQL injection vulnerability and demonstrates how to extract information.
