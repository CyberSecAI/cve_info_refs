- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize the `user_registration_profile_pic_url` value when submitted via the `user_registration_update_profile_details` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views the profile page of a user whose profile has been modified with the malicious payload. This can lead to various attacks, including stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` set to `user_registration_update_profile_details`, the `security` nonce, and a `form_data` payload containing the malicious JavaScript in the `user_registration_profile_pic_url` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with a low privilege level (e.g., a subscriber) and be able to craft a POST request. The attacker needs to obtain the security nonce from the edit profile page of the plugin.
