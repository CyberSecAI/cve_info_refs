The provided content is related to CVE-2021-24905.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks in the `acf7_db_edit_scr_file_delete` AJAX action and fails to validate the file to be deleted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization checks for the AJAX action `acf7_db_edit_scr_file_delete`.
- Missing CSRF protection for the AJAX action `acf7_db_edit_scr_file_delete`.
- Lack of validation of the file being deleted, allowing arbitrary file deletion via path traversal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated user (Subscriber role or higher) can delete arbitrary files on the web server. This could allow an attacker to:
  - Remove critical files like `wp-config.php`, triggering WordPress setup and potentially gaining admin access.
  - Execute arbitrary code or display arbitrary content by manipulating the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action `acf7_db_edit_scr_file_delete`.
- Providing a `fid`, `rid`, `field` parameter and a `val` parameter containing the path to the file to be deleted using path traversal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must be an authenticated user with at least Subscriber role.
- Needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site.
