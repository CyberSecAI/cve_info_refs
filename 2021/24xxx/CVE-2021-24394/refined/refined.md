Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `easy_testimonial_update.php` file of the "Easy Testimonial Manager" WordPress plugin.
*   The plugin uses the `$_GET['id']` parameter directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization, escaping, or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `id` GET parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries on the WordPress database.
*   This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration (reading sensitive information from the database).
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting data).
    *   Potentially gaining administrative access to the WordPress site.
    *   Complete compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the `id` GET parameter in the `admin.php` request when accessing the `easy_testimonial_update` page within the WordPress admin dashboard.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least administrative privileges to access the vulnerable page.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerable line of code is in `inc/easy_testimonial_update.php#74`:
    ```php
    $rows = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT *from ".$wpdb->prefix."easy_testimonial_manager where id=".$_GET['id']);
    ```
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject SQL using a crafted `id` parameter:
    ```
    GET /wp-admin/admin.php?page=easy_testimonial_update&id=page=easy_testimonial_update&id=1 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,user(),NULL,NULL-- - HTTP/1.1
    ```
    This injects a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to extract the database user.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')).
*   The CVSS score is 6.7 (Medium), which reflects the potential impact and ease of exploitation, given the required privileges.
*   The affected plugin version is <= 1.2.0.
*  The researcher who discovered this vulnerability is Syed Sheeraz Ali of Codevigilant.
