Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization and escaping of POST parameters sent to the `wpassetcleanup_fetch_active_plugins_icons` AJAX action within the Asset CleanUp plugin. This action is available to admin users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, meaning the malicious script is embedded within the crafted request, and is reflected back by the server and executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities like:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Data theft
    *   Other actions within the scope of the victim's privileges

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker crafts a form with a hidden input field containing the malicious JavaScript payload and submits it to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trick an administrator into clicking on the malicious link or submitting the crafted form.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need to have an account on the target website since the described vulnerability is reflected. However, they need to induce a logged-in admin user to trigger the payload.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.8.5 of the Asset CleanUp plugin.
*   The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability by using a simple HTML form with a script tag.
