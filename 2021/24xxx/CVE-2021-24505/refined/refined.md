  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin did not sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Title' field when adding a new form, leading to stored XSS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the context of the affected web page. This can be used to execute malicious actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website, when a user visits the affected page.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker can inject malicious code via the 'Title' field when adding a new form. This is then stored in the database and executed whenever the form is viewed by any user.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, with the capability to add a new form, within the WordPress application."
