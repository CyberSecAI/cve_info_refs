Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-24182:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `tutor_quiz_builder_get_answers_by_question` AJAX action within the Tutor LMS plugin did not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`question_id`) when querying the database. This allowed for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (UNION-based):** The primary vulnerability is a UNION-based SQL injection. Attackers can append a UNION clause to the existing SQL query to extract data from the database.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin failed to sanitize the `question_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The plugin used `get_row` and `get_results` without prepared statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, site options, and other data.
*   **Potential Data Modification:** In some cases, where a MySQL server is insecurely configured, attackers might be able to modify information in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a malicious AJAX request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `tutor_quiz_builder_get_answers_by_question` and a crafted `question_id` parameter containing the SQL injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user. According to the Wordfence analysis, even student accounts could exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Proof of Concept:** The content includes a `sqlmap` command and a sample HTTP request to demonstrate the exploit.
*   **Affected Versions:** Tutor LMS versions prior to 1.8.3 are vulnerable.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5 (Medium).
*   **Researcher:** The vulnerability was discovered by Chloe Chamberland from Wordfence.

The content also mentions that the described SQLi could be exploited using blind and time based techniques in addition to the union based one, however, the main vector here is UNION based SQLi.
