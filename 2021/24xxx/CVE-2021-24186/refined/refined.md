```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `get_answer_by_id` function retrieves quiz answers from the database using user-supplied data without proper sanitization or prepared statements, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - UNION based SQL Injection in the `get_answer_by_id` function.
- Impact of exploitation:
    -  An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other data.
- Attack vectors:
    - By submitting specially crafted SQL statements as quiz answers, which are later retrieved by the vulnerable function.
    - The vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user including students.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the vulnerable WordPress site using the Tutor LMS plugin.
