Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization, validation, and escaping of the `order` and `orderby` parameters before using them in SQL queries within the "Paid Member Subscriptions" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authenticated SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`order`, `orderby` parameters) before incorporating them into SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials, subscription information, and payment details.
*   **Data Breaches:** Exposure of personal data.
*   **Loss of data integrity:** Malicious modification of data.
*   **Privilege escalation:** An attacker could potentially use the injected SQL code to escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET requests to the WordPress admin interface. Specifically, vulnerable pages are `pms-members-page` and `pms-payments-page` where the `orderby` and `order` URL parameters can be manipulated to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Admin Interface:** The attack is targeted at the WordPress admin interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with access to the WordPress admin panel to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Admin access:** While the wpscan description mentions "Authenticated SQL Injections", the CVSS score indicates the attacker requires high privileges. This suggests the vulnerability is exploitable by admin users.

**Additional Details from Content:**
*   **Specific parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are `orderby` and `order`.
*   **Affected pages:** The vulnerability is found in the "Members" and "Payments" pages in the WordPress admin area.
*   **Trustwave Advisory:** Trustwave identified and reported the vulnerability.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided proof-of-concept URL demonstrates how to inject a sleep command within the `order` parameter, indicating SQL injection.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4.2 of the plugin, where the code is updated to properly sanitize the `order` parameter and restrict `orderby` to a predefined set of options.
* **CVSS:** The CVSS score of 6.5 (Medium) suggests the vulnerability has a significant impact.

In summary, this vulnerability is a classic example of SQL injection due to the failure to sanitize user inputs, highlighting the importance of parameterized queries and proper input validation in web applications. The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users with admin access to potentially compromise the entire database.
