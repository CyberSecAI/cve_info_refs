Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization, escaping, or validation of the `editid` GET parameter in the Cashtomer WordPress plugin before it's inserted into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The unsanitized input from the `editid` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** Attackers can potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, attackers could potentially gain control of the entire database server.
- **Information Disclosure:** The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates the attacker's ability to extract the database username, which is sensitive information.
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the server configuration, further exploitation may be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the WordPress admin panel.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `editid` parameter within the request is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the WordPress site with at least Subscriber level privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable File:** `admin/view/socialadd.php` within the Cashtomer plugin.
- **Vulnerable Code:** The line `$results = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM $table WHERE id = ".sanitize_text_field($_GET['editid'])."");` in the `socialadd.php` file is vulnerable because it does not properly sanitize the 'editid' parameter, even though `sanitize_text_field` is used, it's insufficient for preventing SQL injection in this context.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates a successful SQL injection using the following request:
    `GET /wp-admin/admin.php?page=add-social-point&id=facebookshare&editid=-9677 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,user(),NULL,NULL--+- HTTP/1.1`
    This PoC uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to extract the database user.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by Syed Sheeraz Ali of Codevigilant.
- The plugin was closed on April 19, 2021, which might indicate that a patch or fix was not released.
- The CVSS score of 6.7 (Medium) indicates the severity of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A1: Injection and CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')).
