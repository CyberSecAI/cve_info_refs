- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `get_query()` function in the `ni-woocommerce-custom-order-status` plugin does not sanitize the `sort` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `niwoocos_ajax` action, `sub_action` set to `order_status_report`, `call` set to `get_report`, and a malicious `sort` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, even with subscriber-level privileges.
