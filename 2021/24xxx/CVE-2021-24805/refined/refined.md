- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly check for CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) in some of its functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can make logged-in users perform unwanted actions, such as updating a comment or a question status.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with embedded forms or JavaScript that, when visited by a logged-in user, performs actions on their behalf without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious link.
