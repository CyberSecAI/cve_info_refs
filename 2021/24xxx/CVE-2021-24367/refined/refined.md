- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Config File Editor WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize user input in the `profileForm[name]` parameter when creating or editing a profile.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected pages. This could lead to privilege escalation if a lower-privileged user with access to the plugin's functionality injects the malicious code, potentially allowing them to gain administrator privileges or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a crafted POST request to the `wcfe-services-profiles-services-profiles-ajaxview` action, specifically injecting malicious JavaScript into the `profileForm[name]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, with at least the ability to access the affected plugin's functionality. By default, only administrator users can do this, but if lower privileged users also have access, they can exploit this vulnerability.
