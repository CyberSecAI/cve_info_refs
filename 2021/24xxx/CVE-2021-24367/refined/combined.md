## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Config File Editor <= 1.7.1 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The WP Config File Editor WordPress plugin was affected by an Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

By default, only administrator users could access the affected functionality, limiting the exploitability of the vulnerability. However, some WordPress admins may allow lesser privileged users to access the plugin's functionality, in which case, privilege escalation could be performed.

### Proof of Concept

Go to Tools->Profile->Create and enter a JavaScript payload in the Name parameter.
Specifically, the profileForm[name] parameter of the wcfe-services-profiles-services-profiles-ajaxview POST action.
