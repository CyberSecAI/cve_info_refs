Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `orderby` GET parameter within the WordPress plugin "Rich Reviews" before its use in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, specifically within the admin panel's pending reviews page. This is due to the unsanitized `orderby` parameter being directly incorporated into a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially manipulate the database by injecting malicious SQL code through the vulnerable `orderby` parameter.
- **Data Exposure:**  A successful exploit can expose sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** In some instances, SQLi can be leveraged to gain higher access levels or control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the WordPress admin panel page that handles pending reviews.
- **`orderby` GET parameter:** Specifically, the malicious SQL code is injected via the `orderby` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative privileges within the WordPress site to access the vulnerable page in the admin panel.
- **Network Access:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `orderby` GET parameter is the point of injection.
- **Code Location:**  The vulnerability exists in the `rich-reviews-admin-tables.php` file of the plugin.
- **Exploitation Examples:** The provided proof of concept examples show how an attacker can inject SQL code using `id AND EXTRACTVALUE(...)` for error-based SQLi or `id AND (SELECT 1339 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Ozmh)` for time-based blind SQLi

**Patch Information:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.9.6 of the "Rich Reviews" plugin.
- The fix implemented input validation on the `orderby` parameter, restricting it to only specific allowed values (`reviewer_name`, `review_rating`, `review_category`) and preventing arbitrary SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content also includes changeset details showing how the code was modified to address the vulnerability in version 1.9.6. This includes changes to sanitization and validation of the `orderby` parameter.
- The change log in `readme.txt` of the plugin also mentions the fix.

In summary, CVE-2021-24753 details an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the "Rich Reviews" WordPress plugin that could allow a malicious administrator to access or manipulate the database by exploiting the lack of input validation in the `orderby` parameter.
