Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type validation in the `wc_help_scout_upload_attachments` function within the `WC_Help_Scout_Ajax` class. This function directly uses the filename provided by the user from the uploaded `$_FILES` array, specifically `$_FILES["file"]["name"]`, as the target file name and saves it to the server without sanitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:** The `wc_help_scout_upload_attachments` function is accessible via the `wp_ajax_nopriv_` action, meaning it does not require user authentication. This allows any unauthenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the server.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** The code directly uses the uploaded file's name, making it possible for an attacker to control the file extension, leading to arbitrary file upload.
*   **Insecure Upload Location:** Files are uploaded to the `/wp-content/uploads/hstmp` directory, which is accessible to anyone on the web

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file, which when accessed directly through the browser, could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could upload files that could deface the website.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could upload files to gain access to sensitive data on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP POST request to `https://<site>/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `wc_help_scout_upload_attachments` and the malicious file in the `file` field of the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any user account or be logged into the target WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target website.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was initially present in versions 2.6-2.8 of the WooCommerce Help Scout plugin.
* Version 2.9.1 fixed the arbitrary PHP upload. However, an image with PHP code inside could still be uploaded and used in combination with a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
* The plugin vendor was contacted by the researchers on March 20, 2021, and a fix was released on March 25, 2021 in v2.9.1.
