- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied data before using it in a SQL query within the `/wp-json/pie/v1/login` REST API endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-json/pie/v1/login` endpoint with malicious SQL code in the `user_login` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, as it is available on the unauthenticated REST API endpoint.
