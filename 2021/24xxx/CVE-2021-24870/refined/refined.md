Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2021-24870:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `wpfc_save_cdn_integration` AJAX action in the WP Fastest Cache plugin lacks a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) check.
- The plugin also fails to sanitize and escape certain options available through this AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The absence of CSRF protection allows an attacker to force a logged-in administrator to unknowingly execute the malicious request.
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The failure to sanitize and escape input allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code which will then be stored in the plugin's settings and executed in the browsers of other users who access those settings pages or features.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in administrator's browser.
- This could enable the attacker to perform administrative actions on the website, including changing settings, adding new users, or injecting further malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `wpfc_save_cdn_integration` AJAX action.
- An attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into triggering it.
- This is commonly achieved through social engineering, such as sending a crafted link or embedding the request in a website or email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs no prior authentication.
- They need the ability to trick a logged-in administrator into making a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request containing the XSS payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to versions of the WP Fastest Cache plugin before 0.9.5.
- The fix is to update the plugin to version 0.9.5 or later, which includes the necessary security fixes.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Marc Montpas.
- The vulnerability is classified as CSRF leading to Stored XSS and has a CVSS score of 8.8, indicating high severity.
