![My First CVE-2021-24176](data:image/gif;base64...)![My First CVE-2021-24176](https://ganofins.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jh_logger_xss.png.webp)

Hello everyone,

A while back, when I was hunting on a private program on HackerOne. Let’s call it **redacted.com**. I saw it was using WordPress CMS at **redacted.com/blog/**

I performed [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) scan with my custom WordPress plugin wordlist and found some interesting plugins. One of which was [JH 404](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jh-404-logger/) [Logger](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jh-404-logger/) plugin. Being a PHP enthusiast, I quickly downloaded WordPress and extracted it to my Apache httpd server directory, and started the server. Then I installed the JH 404 Logger plugin on it.

Then I checked what it really does and what are its functionalities. It is a simple plugin to record the visits at 404 URLs with their paths and counts and displays that on the WordPress dashboard but the catch is, it doesn’t sanitize the path of 404 URL which I found by reviewing the source code of the plugin.
So, I immediately created a 404 URL with the payload –

```
http://localhost/blog/non_existing_path'"><img src=qw.jpg onerror=alert(0)>'
```

Quickly created a report and sent it to that private program. But guess what, they marked it as Informative. Cause it wasn’t in their scope. But it was never mentioned in their scope that redacted.com/blog is not in scope. They only mentioned blog.redacted.com is not in-scope in their policy.
I tried explaining even though redacted.com/blog is not in scope, but still, this vulnerability impacts the main domain **redacted.com** which is in-scope. As because of this vulnerability in this plugin an attacker can perform stored XSS and they weren’t even using ***httponly*** flag on their auth cookie. It can allow an attacker to steal the victim’s cookie or execute any arbitrary Javascript code. But they kept denying this and never accepted it and guess what they are still using this plugin at **redacted.com/blog**

Moving ahead then I thought to report it to the developer of this plugin. But he never responded back to me even after several tries. So then, I reported it to the WordPress team but they said due to a high number of reports every day I won’t receive any further communication regarding this. Then I reported this vulnerability to [wpscan](https://wpscan.com/) and in no time they verified and assigned a CVE id [CVE-2021-24176](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24176) to it.

That’s how I got my first CVE.

**CVE-2021-24176 POC**

Thanks for reading 🙂
Lemme know in the comments if you’re interesting to know how I got my 2nd CVE id.

Hello,

In the month of June 2021, inspired by the awesome Twitter infosec community’s tweets of sticking to a single target and keep hunting on it until you understand it better than the developer who created it. I decided to start the hunt on a new program and stick to it. I decided to only focus on OAuth related bugs for the first week.

Following my usual methodology, I started the nuclei scan with the community [nuclei-templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/) for spreaker.com and started browsing all its features, registration, forgot password functions with burp suite turned.

After a while, the nuclei scan came with no hit

But I didn’t quit and I registered an account on the site and kept exploring its features. Then there I found an option to create OAuth apps, which allows integrating spreaker OAuth login into 3rd party sites.
So, I created an app there and tried injecting XSS, CSTI, SSTI payloads in the app name, description, callback URL, website URL but no luck.

Then, I started reading different writeups on OAuth listed at [Pentester.land](https://pentester.land/list-of-bug-bounty-writeups.html)
Those writeups taught me to test for authorization code multiple usage vulnerabilities, authorization code never expires issue, race condition on using the authorization code, read the RFC#6749, etc. That finally leads me in finding my first vulnerability at spreaker

### 1. OAuth app related

* I found that the authorization code generated by the app can be exchanged for an access token even after deleting the OAuth app from spreaker
* One can use the refresh token to generate a fresh access token even after deleting the OAuth app
* Access tokens created by OAuth app isn’t expired or revoked even after a developer deletes his/her OAuth app
* New access token can be used to make API calls even the app for that access token doesn’t exist
* I found that the old access token pair is still not expired meaning even after generating an access token with the refresh token the old access token can still be used but the rfc clearly states to revoke such access tokens (<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749>)

Immediately, I created a report, recorded a POC, and sent the report. After a week of waiting they reply “token expiration times are carefully chosen to balance security and user experience”

I tried explaining the detailed impact of such issues based on the RFC which strictly forbids such behavior but I never got any response from their side

**Similar reports:**
<https://hackerone.com/reports/57603>
<https://hackerone.com/reports/55140>

### 2. Access tokens for 3rd party logins aren’t expired even after deleting the account at spreaker.com

I found that the access tokens for the 3rd party OAuth providers aren’t expired on disconnecting the 3rd party app or even after deleting your account at spreaker

An attacker can use leaked access tokens to fetch the user resources even after the user has disconnected the 3rd party app or even deleted his/her account

Again created another report and sent it to them. After a week I got the same response like on my first report “token expiration times are carefully chosen to balance security and user experience”.

### 3. OAuth CSRF due to no state param at login with FB

I found that the *state* parameter is not used along with Login with Facebook which leads in OAuth CSRF.

Because of this an attacker can login the victim to his account, making the victim that this is his own account and the victim may store sensitive data PII at there, which can be accessed by the attacker.

I agree they could mark this one as informative/NA because some programs don’t accept CSRF on Login/Logout but I still reported it and they closed this as NA.

**Similar reports:**
<https://hackerone.com/reports/2228>

### 4. Pre-account takeover of victim/Blocking victim from accessing his/her account

After a couple of days later I found that signing up an account at spreaker using OAuth login an attacker can access/control a victim’s account by just changing his/her account’s email address to the victim’s email address

I also found out that once an attacker changes his/her account’s email to a victim’s email. The victim won’t be able to sign up or reset the password of his/her account. Only the attacker can send account confirmation emails to the victim’s email address.

Immediately, I wrote a report and sent it to them. After a week of waiting they reply “In order to exploit this vulnerability, you need to perform a man-in-the-middle attack” Seriously?

### 5. com.spreaker.android leaking OAuth secret key for the spreaker’s own OAuth app

I found that the spreaker’s android app com.spreaker.android is leaking client\_secret token during OAuth login.

Created a report and sent it to them and this time they say “In order to exploit this vulnerability you need to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.”

### 6. com.spreaker.android.studio leaking OAuth secret key for the spreaker’s own OAuth app

I found that the spreaker’s another android app com.spreaker.android.studio is also leaking client\_secret token during OAuth login.

Created a report and sent it to them and their response “This doesn’t describe a vulnerability and it doesn’t qualify for a reward since what you described is the intended behavior”

**FML**
I quit hunting on that program that same week. All of my reports were closed as NA and I tried explaining to them about the impact of each vulnerability several times but I never received any response from their side.

![I wrote a Python module Proxy Extractor](data:image/gif;base64...)![I wrote a Python module Proxy Extractor](https://ganofins.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/proxy-extractor.png.webp)

Hello everyone,
In this post, I will tell you how I wrote a [**Python module + CLI**](https://github.com/Ganofins/proxy-extractor) script to fetch proxies from free proxy listing sites.

I am a *part-time freelancer* and I get tons of projects related to data scraping such as scraping Instagram posts, scraping Udemy course details, scraping leads from LinkedIn, etc.
Now obviously, fetching contents from such sites in bulk in a short interval of time from the same IP will result in blocking your IP address.

Thus, in order to get contents from such sites without getting blocked, I use multiple solutions such as –

* *Using Proxies*
* *Using random User-Agent with each request*
* *Adding sleep interval between each request*
* *Using referrer, authority, etc headers in the request*

In this post, I will just talk about Proxies.
I use free proxies or paid proxies based upon the client’s demand and requirement.

**Paid proxies** can be easily added in a list or array or file and can be used within the script.

*But for using* **free proxies** *–*
Firstly, I would need to find free proxy listing sites, then I would have to create a script to scrape proxies from there.
Then, I would have to create a function to check whether that proxy is working or not. Then, I will create a list or array to add only the working proxies into it.

Now, doing the above steps each time for each new script or project is very tiring and boring.
Thus, a few days ago I got an idea to write a Python module for that purpose which can also be used as Command Line Utility to fetch the free proxies.

### [**Proxy Extractor**](https://github.com/ganofins/proxy-extractor/)

![](data:image/gif;base64...)![](https://ganofins.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/proxy-extractor-1024x432.png.webp)

Proxy Extractor

#### **Now, let’s dive into its code and see how I wrote that module + CLI utility –**

**1**. **proxy\_extractor/\_\_init\_\_.py**

Created this file to make Python treat this directory as a package.

**2. proxy\_extractor/useragents.py**

I created this file to store the list of User-Agents so that with each request a random user-agent can be used.
I wrote a function ***rand\_user\_agent*** to pick random user-agent from that list using the [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) module.

**3. proxy\_extractor/requester.py**

This file contains a function ***make\_request*** to send an asynchronous request to the URL passed in that method.
To make an asynchronous request, I used [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/) module.
I also used function ***rand\_user\_agent*** from useragents.py to pick a random user-agent and pass with the request made by the ***make\_request*** function.

**4. proxy\_extractor/scraper.py**

This file contains a function ***\_extract\_proxies\_free\_proxy\_list\_net*** to parse the HTML content requested from [free-proxy-list](https://free-proxy-list.net/) with the help of [bs4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) module.

**5. proxy\_extractor/checker.py**

This file contains a async function ***proxy\_check*** to check whether the passed proxy is working or not by aiohttp module and a random user-agent from the useragents.py with a timeout limit (default: 50 seconds).

***\*\*You can check out [this post](https://iq.opengenus.org/asyncio-async-and-await-in-python/) in order to understand the basics about async, await, asyncio module.***

**6. proxy\_extractor/extractor.py**

This file contains several [coroutines](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutines) (async functions) –

***AsyncIter class(items) –***
This class takes a list as an input and returns an async list which can be used with async for loops.

***extract\_proxies(https, proxy\_count) –***
This async function fetches the HTML content from [free-proxy-list](https://free-proxy-list.net/) using the *make\_request* function of requester.py file and then that HTML content is parsed by the *\_extract\_proxies\_free\_proxy\_list\_net* function of scraper.py and it returns a parsed list consisting of IP addresses, their countries, their port, https support, or not, etc.

***get\_extracted\_proxies(proxy\_list) –***
This function takes an async list and yields each element.

***proxy\_remove(proxy, proxy\_count, timeout) –***
This function checks the passed proxy is working or not and only adds a working proxy to a *working\_proxy\_list* list.

***create\_jobs(proxy\_list, https, proxy\_count, timeout) –***
This function adds each proxy element yielded from the *get\_extracted\_proxies* function to a tasks list.

***extract\_proxy(https=False, proxy\_count=100, timeout=50) –***
This function firstly extracts the proxies using the *extract\_proxies* function and then creates a *new\_event\_loop* with the use of [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) module.
*\*An event loop of asyncio runs asynchronous tasks and callbacks.*
Then, I used the *set\_event\_loop* method of asyncio to set the newly created loop as the current loop.
Then, that extracted proxy list is passed to the *AsyncIter* class to get an async list of proxies. After that, I used *run\_until\_complete* method of asyncio to run the *create\_jobs* function until its completion.
At last, it returns a list of working proxies.

**7. color.py**

I used this file to assign the color code values based on the operating system a user is using.

**8. cli.py**

Using this file, one can use this Python module as a Command-Line utility. I have used [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) module for parsing the command arguments. It calls the *extract\_proxy* function of *proxy\_extractor/extractor.py* file.

Those were the code files used to build this Python module + CLI utility. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/Ganofins/proxy-extractor) and can also read about its installation and usage.

**Feel free to contribute to this project.**
I hope you got some insights into my module.
