Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2021-24176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the JH 404 Logger WordPress plugin, where it fails to sanitize the path and referrer of 404 URLs before displaying them in the WordPress dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin's lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the path and/or referrer fields of 404 errors. This code is then stored in the plugin's logs and executed when an administrator views the log in the WordPress dashboard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of an administrator's browser session.
- **Cookie Theft:** By executing malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal the administrator's authentication cookies.
- **Account Takeover:** The attacker could potentially take over an administrator's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user triggers a 404 error on the website, by accessing a non-existent URL. The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing XSS payload to trigger the 404 error. The crafted URL will be recorded by the vulnerable plugin.
- The admin visits the WordPress dashboard where the logs of the plugin are displayed, and the malicious javascript is executed in the admin's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no authentication to trigger the 404 error and inject the malicious payload.
- The attacker does not require access to the dashboard.
- The attacker only needs to craft a malicious URL.
- The vulnerable plugin must be installed and active.
