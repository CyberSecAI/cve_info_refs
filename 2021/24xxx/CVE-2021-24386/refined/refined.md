- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin failed to sanitize uploaded SVG files, allowing malicious code injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file and then induce another user to access the file directly, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By uploading a malicious SVG file through the plugin's upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with author or higher privileges.
