# LifterLMS < 4.21.2 - Access Other Student Grades/Answers via IDOR

### Description

The plugin was affected by an IDOR issue, allowing students to see other student answers and grades

### Proof of Concept

- Add 2 users with Student role for the scenario .
- Create A course With a quiz ( I picked True or Flase question for my quiz)
- Set Enrol on Free ( for the ease of scenario )
- Enrol into the Course with Student B and submit your answer to the Course .
The plugin will give a token like : https://soft-dream.myliftersite.com/quiz/%d8%ac%d9%85%d8%b9-quiz/?attempt\_key=wYK To Check your answer was true or false.
Now Login as a Student A and Enroll in the Course. You can just use the URL https://soft-dream.myliftersite.com/quiz/%d8%ac%d9%85%d8%b9-quiz/?attempt\_key=wYK and reach the Student B answer.
