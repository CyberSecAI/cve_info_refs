Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization, validation, or escaping of the `srch` POST parameter within the `includes/settings.php` file of the Stock In WordPress plugin. The parameter's value is directly echoed back in the HTML output without any processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs because user-supplied input (`srch` parameter) is directly included in the HTML output without encoding or sanitizing the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to:
* Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session when they visit the affected page.
* This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is through the `srch` POST parameter when the `stock_in` admin page is accessed.
* An attacker can craft a malicious URL or form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable page with a malicious payload in the `srch` parameter.
* When a user, including one with minimal contributor rights, visits the affected page with the malicious crafted input, the injected JavaScript executes within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=stock_in`)
* Minimal access level required: The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with Contributor role privileges.
* The attacker does not need to have high level of privileges, meaning this vulnerability is easily exploitable.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet in `includes/settings.php` is:
```php
$search = $_POST['srch'];
echo 'Showing Results for "'. $search .'"';
```
This demonstrates how the user-supplied `srch` parameter is directly outputted into the HTML, leading to the XSS vulnerability.

**PoC (Proof of Concept):**
The provided PoC demonstrates how to trigger the XSS vulnerability using a crafted POST request with a script payload:
```
POST /wp-admin/admin.php?page=stock_in HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.28.128.50
Content-Length: 66
Cache-Control: max-age=0

Connection: close

srch=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&search=Search+Product
```
The payload `%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` when decoded becomes `<script>alert(1)</script>`, which is a simple XSS payload that triggers a browser alert dialog when executed.
