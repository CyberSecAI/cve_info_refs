Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24256

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of server-side enforcement of HTML tag options within the "Elementor - Header, Footer & Blocks Template" plugin. Specifically, the "Page Title" and "Site Title" widgets allow users to select an HTML tag for formatting. However, this selection is not properly sanitized, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary HTML tags like `<script>`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is that injected script tags are stored in the database and executed when a page is viewed or previewed.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin fails to validate the "heading\_tag" parameter, allowing users to input any tag, including `script`.
- **Lack of output sanitization:** The plugin outputs the provided HTML tag without proper sanitization, allowing the execution of injected scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
- **Site Takeover:** If an administrator views a page with injected JavaScript, an attacker can potentially take over the website.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A lower-privileged user (e.g., contributor) can escalate their privileges by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Injection:** An attacker with contributor access or higher can directly inject a script tag or javascript code into the "heading\_tag" field of the affected widgets.
- **Remotely Sourced Script:** An attacker can set the heading tag to script and set a size parameter to a remotely hosted script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress Account:** An attacker needs a WordPress account with at least "contributor" privileges. This is sufficient to access the Elementor editor and modify content with the affected widgets.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the plugin vulnerability and the ability to inject script tags via the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin prior to 1.5.8, and it is patched in version 1.5.8.
- The "Page Title" and "Site Title" widgets are both affected.
- The vulnerability is similar to those found in the main Elementor plugin.
- The CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium) as indicated in the wpscan content.
- The Wordfence article notes a CVSS score of 6.4 (Medium) using a different vector, but both agree that is a medium severity vulnerability.
