- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `get_ays_popupboxes()` and `get_popup_categories()` functions in the plugin did not sanitize or validate the `orderby` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Blind SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to extract sensitive information or manipulate the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET or POST request to the plugin's admin dashboard, specifically targeting the `orderby` parameter with malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least admin privileges to access the vulnerable functionality within the admin dashboard.
