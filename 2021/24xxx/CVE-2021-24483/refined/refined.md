{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `get_poll_categories()`, `get_polls()` and `get_reports()` functions in the plugin did not sanitize the `orderby` parameter before using it in SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `orderby` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification or complete database takeover.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `orderby` parameter in HTTP GET or POST requests sent to the vulnerable plugin's admin pages.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin dashboard."
