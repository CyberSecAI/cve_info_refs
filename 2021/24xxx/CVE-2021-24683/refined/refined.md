- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Weather Effect plugin lacks CSRF checks when saving settings and does not properly validate or escape these settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The absence of CSRF checks allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): User-supplied data is not properly sanitized or escaped, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser when the settings are viewed in both the frontend and backend. This could lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - CSRF attack: An attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, modifies the plugin settings.
    - XSS attack: The crafted malicious payload, embedded in the settings, is executed when a user views the affected page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator to submit a crafted form.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform the CSRF and XSS attack
