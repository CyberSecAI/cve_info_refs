Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper escaping of the "Image URL" setting for a custom universal button within the AddToAny plugin. Specifically, the plugin was not sanitizing the `button_src` variable before using it within the `<img>` tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Because the provided `button_src` was directly used in HTML, it allowed the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the "Image URL" field. This code would be executed in the browsers of users visiting pages where the AddToAny share buttons are displayed.
*   The impact ranges from defacement, redirection, stealing user session data, or more advanced attacks depending on the attacker's goals.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the WordPress admin panel, specifically the settings for the AddToAny plugin.
*   An attacker with the ability to modify the plugin settings (Admin+) could inject the malicious payload in the "Image URL" field of a custom universal button.
*   Once the crafted image URL is saved, the XSS payload is stored in the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs administrator-level access (or equivalent) to modify the AddToAny plugin settings. The description mentions "high privilege users" and "Admin+".

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is located in `add-to-any.php`, where the `button_src` variable is used to construct the `<img>` tag.
*   The fix, introduced in version 1.7.48, uses `esc_url()` to properly escape the `button_src` before including it in the HTML, which prevents the execution of injected Javascript.
```php
  // Vulnerable code (before fix)
  $button = '<img src="' . $button_src . '"' . $button_width . $button_height . $button_style . ' alt="Share">';

  // Fixed code (after fix)
  $button = '<img src="' . esc_url( $button_src ) . '"' . $button_width . $button_height . $button_style . ' alt="Share">';
```
**More Detail than CVE:**

Yes, the provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE entry, including:
*   The specific vulnerable code location and the fix applied.
*   The method of exploitation (adding the XSS payload in the Image URL field).
*   The affected plugin version and the fixed version.
*   A proof of concept payload.
*   CVSS score

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a stored XSS in the AddToAny WordPress plugin caused by a lack of input sanitization. Attackers with administrative access could inject malicious JavaScript via the "Image URL" setting, which would then be executed on frontend pages for all users. The fix implemented was to escape the URL before including it in the `<img>` tag.
