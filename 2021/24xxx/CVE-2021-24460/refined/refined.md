Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `get_fb_likeboxes()` function in the "Popup Like box - Page Plugin" plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the `orderby` parameter before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, it lacks a whitelist or proper validation of user-supplied input in the `orderby` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. Because the `orderby` parameter is directly incorporated into SQL statements without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database by manipulating SQL queries using boolean-based blind injection.
- **Data Manipulation:** Though not explicitly stated in the provided content, SQL injection can also potentially lead to data modification or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the WordPress admin panel. Specifically, the attacker modifies the `orderby` parameter within the query string. The vulnerable code resides in the admin dashboard, indicating an authenticated attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the WordPress admin dashboard in order to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker should know that the `orderby` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Ability to craft SQL injection payloads:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting the SQL injection payloads, as demonstrated by the SQLMAP example in the proof of concept.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept using `sqlmap`, demonstrating the practical exploitability of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in version 3.5.3 of the plugin.
*   The CVSS score of 7.6 indicates a high severity.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-89 which means improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.
