- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bug in the handling of process handles in `OVRServiceLauncher.exe`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper management of process handles allows for the exposure of a privileged process handle to an unprivileged process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation. An attacker could leverage the exposed privileged handle to gain elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs locally, within the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a local presence on the system and the ability to execute an unprivileged process.
