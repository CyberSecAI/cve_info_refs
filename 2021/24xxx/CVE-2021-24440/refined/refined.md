- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sign-up Sheets plugin failed to sanitize or escape user-supplied input when creating a new sheet. Specifically, the "Title", "Details", and "Task" fields were vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields. This malicious code will then be executed when other administrators view the "All Sheets" page in the admin dashboard.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a WordPress administrator. The attacker injects the malicious payload via the vulnerable "Title", "Details", and "Task" fields of a new sheet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to create new sheets within the plugin.
