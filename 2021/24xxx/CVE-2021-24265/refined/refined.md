Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24265:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in the "Rife Elementor Extensions & Templates" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the "Writing Effect Headline" widget allows users to select an HTML tag for formatting text. This tag parameter is not correctly enforced on the server side.
*   The plugin allows a user to modify the “tag” parameter, injecting a “script” tag instead of the expected heading tags (h1, h2, etc.), or remotely sourced scripts.
*   The injected script is then rendered on the page without escaping, leading to execution of the malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code is saved within the plugin's settings and executed when a page containing the affected widget is viewed or previewed.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or validate the 'tag' parameter, allowing arbitrary HTML tags to be injected, including `<script>` tags.
*   **Insufficient Server-Side Validation:** The plugin does not properly enforce the allowed HTML tags on the server-side, making it susceptible to manipulation through requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Site Takeover:** If an administrator views a page containing the malicious code, the attacker can potentially take over the site by escalating privileges through JavaScript execution.
*   **Data Theft and Modification:** The attacker could also use the XSS vulnerability to steal sensitive data, modify site content, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Widget Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the "Writing Effect Headline" widget.
*   **Malicious `save_builder` Request:** The attacker sends a `save_builder` request containing a modified "tag" parameter with JavaScript.
*   **Viewing/Previewing Saved Page:**  The injected script is executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed by other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Contributor Role or Higher:** An attacker needs at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to use the Elementor editor.
*   **Ability to Modify Elementor Content:** The attacker needs the ability to add and edit content using Elementor, which includes the affected widget.
*   **Target Interaction:** The injected script runs when another user, particularly an administrator, views or previews the content.
