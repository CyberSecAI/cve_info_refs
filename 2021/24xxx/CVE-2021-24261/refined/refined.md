  "CVE-2021-24261": {
    "Description": "The “HT Mega – Absolute Addons for Elementor Page Builder” WordPress Plugin before 1.5.7 has several widgets that are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by lower-privileged users such as contributors. The vulnerability lies in the fact that while the element control lists a fixed set of possible HTML tags, it is possible to send a ‘save_builder’ request containing JavaScript in the tag parameters, which is not filtered and is output without escaping. This JavaScript will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.",
    "Root cause": "The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for HTML tags in multiple widgets before outputting them in the page builder. Specifically, the plugin allows JavaScript code to be injected into the HTML tag parameters of various widgets like `htmega_call_to_action`, `htmega_section_title`, `htmega_accordion`, and others, despite the UI providing a list of allowed tags.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Cross-site scripting vulnerability",
      "Lack of output encoding"
    ],
     "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a page or post, which will execute when the page is viewed or previewed by other users, potentially leading to site takeover if an administrator views the compromised content.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By sending a crafted ‘save_builder’ request containing JavaScript in the HTML tag parameters of multiple widgets."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access to the WordPress site in order to use the Elementor page builder and save malicious code.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is similar to those found in the main Elementor plugin and other Elementor add-ons, and the issue is due to developers using insecure code examples from Elementor's documentation."
