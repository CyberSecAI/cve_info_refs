- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the Description fields of Cost Calculator > Price Settings and Text Preview field of Project. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view the affected pages. This could lead to session hijacking, account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with Contributor or higher privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Description" field of a Cost Calculator's Price Settings and the "Text Preview" field of a Project. The XSS payload will trigger when an admin or any user views the page containing the cost calculator shortcode, or edit project page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor role access to the WordPress website to create or edit the content and insert the malicious code.
