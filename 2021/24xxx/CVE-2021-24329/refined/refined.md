- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize the `wp_cache_location` parameter in its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser when they access the affected page. This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user with the ability to modify the plugin's settings through the WordPress admin panel. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `wp_cache_location` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with administrator or editor level permissions, or any role that can access and modify plugin settings. The attacker needs to have the ability to send POST requests to the WordPress admin panel.
