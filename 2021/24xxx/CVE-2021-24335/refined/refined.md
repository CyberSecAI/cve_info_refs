Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-24335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from the theme's failure to properly sanitize the `serviceestimatekey` search parameter before outputting it back into the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This means that malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the vulnerable parameter and executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript into the page, potentially leading to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing user cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   **Data theft:**  Collecting sensitive information displayed on the page.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or initiating downloads of malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript within the `serviceestimatekey` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning an attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit it.
