## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ShareThis Dashboard for Google Analytics < 2.5.2 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or escape the 'ga\_action' parameter in the stats view before outputting it back in an attribute when the plugin is connected to a Google Analytics account, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue which will be executed in the context of a logged in administrator

### Proof of Concept

Plugin needs to be connected to Google Analytics account.
