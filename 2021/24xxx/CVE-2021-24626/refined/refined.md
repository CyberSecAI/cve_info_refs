Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Chameleon CSS plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the `css_id` parameter within the `remove_css` AJAX action is directly inserted into a `DELETE` query without escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89). The lack of sanitization on the `css_id` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** Any authenticated user, even a subscriber, can trigger the vulnerable AJAX call. There are no capability checks in place.
*  **Missing CSRF Protection:** The plugin lacks CSRF protection making it easier to exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the WordPress database. This could lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:**  Retrieving sensitive information from the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** Modifying or deleting data, including user information, posts, or other critical content.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining administrative access by manipulating user roles in the database.
    *   **Denial of Service:** By injecting time-based SQL injections that cause the server to hang.
*   The CVSS score of 9.1 (Critical) indicates a high severity vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network using HTTP requests.
*   **AJAX:** The vulnerability lies within an AJAX endpoint of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, but can be a subscriber-level user.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the website.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the endpoint and parameters being used by the vulnerable AJAX call (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=remove_css` and `css_id` parameter).

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `ccss-admin-ajax.php` file, specifically at line 95.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject SQL code using the `css_id` parameter in a POST request. The provided SQLi example is: `1 AND (SELECT 7806 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))CVtK)`.
*   SQLMap command to verify the vulnerability is also provided.

**Additional Notes:**
* The plugin has no known fix.
*  The vulnerability was initially disclosed to WPScan on June 15, 2021, and publicly disclosed on October 7, 2021, after CVE assignment in August 2021.
* The affected version of the plugin is 1.2, and potentially earlier versions.
