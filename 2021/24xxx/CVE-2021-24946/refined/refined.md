Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-24946:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `Modern Events Calendar Lite` WordPress plugin. The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `time` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This parameter is processed within the `mec_load_single_page` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. By manipulating the `time` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable AJAX action (`mec_load_single_page`) is accessible to unauthenticated users, meaning an attacker doesn't need a valid user account to exploit this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers may be able to modify database records.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, in some cases SQL injection can lead to code execution on the server through advanced techniques.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided proof of concept uses `sleep(10)` which indicates that a denial of service could be achieved by injecting multiple payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `mec_load_single_page` and a malicious value provided in the `time` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the WordPress site.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable AJAX action name and the vulnerable `time` parameter.
