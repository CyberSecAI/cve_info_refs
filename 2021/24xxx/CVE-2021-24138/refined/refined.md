- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the AdRotate plugin's handling of the "id" parameter within the `adrotate-statistics` page, specifically when viewing a group's statistics. The plugin does not properly sanitize this parameter, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is an **Authenticated SQL Injection (SQLi)**.  The "id" parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
    -   **Extract information from the database**: By injecting SQL queries, attackers can retrieve sensitive information such as database schema, user credentials, or application data.
    -   **Manipulate data**: SQL injection can be used to modify or delete data within the database.
    -   **Potentially gain server access**: Depending on the database configuration, SQL injection may be leveraged to execute system commands or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via the HTTP GET request to the WordPress admin panel `wp-admin/admin.php`. The vulnerable parameter is `id` within the `adrotate-statistics` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have **administrator-level privileges** within the WordPress site to access the vulnerable functionality. The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries in the "id" parameter.
