Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24897:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization or escaping of the sub-title field within the "Add Subtitle" WordPress plugin. This occurs when the sub-title is output on a page, specifically when using the classic editor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into the web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful XSS attack can lead to various impacts, including:
*   **Malicious redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   **Data theft:** Stealing sensitive data like session cookies or login credentials.
*   **Website defacement:** Modifying the appearance or content of the website.
*   **Administrative actions:** Potentially performing administrative actions on behalf of the compromised user if they have the necessary permissions.
*   **Malware distribution:** Infecting users with malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves the following steps:
1.  The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" level permissions on the WordPress site.
2.  The attacker creates or edits a post.
3.  Using the classic editor, the attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the sub-title field of the post.
4.  When a user views or previews the post containing the malicious sub-title, the injected script executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to have access to the classic editor to access the sub-title field.
