Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control within the `Image Source Control` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `save_meta` function in `/includes/gutenberg/gutenberg.php` did not adequately check user permissions before updating post meta data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin allowed users with the "Contributor" role and higher to modify post meta data for any post, regardless of their editing privileges for that specific post. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege, where users should only be able to perform actions necessary for their role.
*   **Arbitrary Post Meta Change:** The vulnerability allows arbitrary post meta values to be changed, which could potentially allow attackers to modify critical data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could alter post meta data, potentially leading to undesirable changes in site content or functionality.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not direct privilege escalation, an attacker could use this vulnerability to manipulate data to indirectly gain access or manipulate other features they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on what meta data is changed, attackers could introduce vulnerabilities, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP requests to the WordPress AJAX interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker must have a WordPress user account with at least the "Contributor" role or higher.
*   **Post Editor Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the post editor interface.
*   **Knowledge of AJAX Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `isc_save_meta` AJAX endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `save_meta` function within the `/includes/gutenberg/gutenberg.php` file.
*   The function receives POST data including `id` (post ID), `key` (meta key), and `value` (new meta value).
*   The original code only checked `current_user_can('edit_posts')` which only checks the general user role instead of checking if the user has access to edit a specific post.
*   The fix in version 2.3.1 includes an additional check:  `current_user_can( 'edit_post', $_post['id'] )` before allowing the post meta to be updated. This ensures the user has proper permission to edit the given post.
*   The `isc_fields` array defines the allowed meta keys that could be changed via the function. This prevents arbitrary meta changes outside the scope of the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided changelog mentions: "prevent contributors from updating unrelated post meta, props to wpscan". This indicates that WPScan identified and reported the vulnerability.
*   The CVE is classified as "ACCESS CONTROLS" with an OWASP Top 10 mapping to "A5: Broken Access Control" and CWE mapping to "CWE-284".
*   The CVSS score is 5.4 (medium).
