{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin was vulnerable to Authenticated Stored XSS due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the separator field.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the separator field. This code would be stored in the database and executed when the same functionality is triggered, potentially allowing an attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies or redirecting users to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, specifically the 'Separator' input field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to access and modify the plugin's settings."
