Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-24997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WP Guppy plugin, in versions prior to 1.3, had insufficient authorization checks on some of its REST API endpoints. This lack of authorization allows any user (including unauthenticated users) to access these endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:**  The primary weakness is the absence of proper authorization mechanisms for several REST API endpoints.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** This allows unauthorized access to sensitive data like usernames and chat histories between users.
- **Arbitrary Message Sending:** The vulnerability also allows an attacker to send messages as any arbitrary user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive user information, including usernames and chat conversations, potentially leading to privacy breaches.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can send messages as other users, which could result in misinformation, impersonation, or other malicious activities within the chat system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the plugin's REST API endpoints. These endpoints are accessible via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication. They simply need to know the website's URL and be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. This can be done remotely from any location.

**Technical details:**

The provided proof of concept (PoC) script shows three ways to exploit the vulnerability:
  -  Retrieving all users: `/wp-json/guppy/v2/load-guppy-users`
  -  Sending a message as a different user: `/wp-json/guppy/v2/send-guppy-message`
  -  Retrieving chat history: `/wp-json/guppy/v2/load-guppy-user-chat`

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "NO AUTHORISATION" with a OWASP Top 10 category of "A5: Broken Access Control".
- The associated CWE is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
- The CVSS score is 7.5 (High).
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3 of the plugin.
