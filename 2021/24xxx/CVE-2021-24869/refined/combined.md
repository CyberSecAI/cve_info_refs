# Multiple vulnerabilities in WP Fastest Cache plugin

Updated on October 30, 2021 - Marc Montpas

During an internal audit of the WP Fastest Cache plugin, we uncovered an Authenticated [SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) vulnerability and a Stored XSS ([Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)) via [Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) (CSRF) issue.

If exploited, the SQL Injection bug could grant attackers access to privileged information from the affected site’s database (e.g., usernames and hashed passwords). It can only be exploited if the [classic-editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) plugin is also installed and activated on the site.

Successfully exploiting the CSRF & Stored XSS vulnerability could enable bad actors to perform any action the logged-in administrator they targeted is allowed to do on the targeted site.

We reported the vulnerabilities to this plugin’s author via email, and they recently released version 0.9.5 to address them. We strongly recommend that you update to the latest version of the plugin and have an established security solution on your site, such as [Jetpack Security](https://jetpack.com/features/security/).

## Details

**Plugin Name:** WP Fastest Cache
**Plugin URI:** <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/>
**Author:** <https://www.wpfastestcache.com/>

## The Vulnerabilities

### Authenticated SQL Injection

**Affected versions:** < 0.9.5
**CVE-ID:** CVE-2021-24869
**CVSSv3.1:** [7.7](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)
**CWSS:** [73.6](https://www.cwss-score.info/#TI:H,0.9/AP:D,0.7/AL:NA,1/IC:NA,1.0/FC:T,1/RP:RU,0.7/RL:NA,1/AV:I,1/AS:NA,1/IN:A,1/SC:A,1/BI:H,0.9/DI:NA,1/EX:M,0.6/EC:N,1/P:NA,1/)

```

                public static function set_urls_with_terms(){
                        global $wpdb;
                        $terms = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM `".$wpdb->prefix."term_relationships` WHERE `object_id`=".static::$id, ARRAY_A);

                        foreach ($terms as $term_key => $term_val){
                                static::set_term_urls($term_val["term_taxonomy_id"]);
                        }
                }

```

The `set_urls_with_terms` method directly concatenates **static::$id** to an SQL query, which is an issue since any logged-in users can store arbitrary values in that property, via the [SinglePreloadWPFC::set\_id()](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-fastest-cache/trunk/inc/single-preload.php?rev=2599473#L115) method. This method is executed when the `admin_notices` WordPress action is run.

```

                public static function set_id(){
                        if(isset($_GET["post"]) && $_GET["post"]){
                                static::$id = esc_sql($_GET["post"]);

                                if(get_post_status(static::$id) != "publish"){
                                        static::$id = 0;
                                }
                        }
                }

```

Although `set_id` checks that the provided ID points to a valid, published post using the [get\_post\_status()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_status/) function, this isn’t enough to validate that it *only* contains that ID.

The get\_post\_status() functioneventually uses [get\_post()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post/) internally, which casts the ID it receives to integer before querying the database for the related post.

Simply put, if the ID provided is `1234 OR 1=1`, get\_post\_status**()** will retrieve the status of the post whose ID is `1234`, but `1234 OR 1=1` is going to be concatenated to the vulnerable SQL query in SinglePreloadWPFC::set\_urls\_with\_terms().
