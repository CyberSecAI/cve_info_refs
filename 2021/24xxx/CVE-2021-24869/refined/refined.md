Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `set_urls_with_terms` method in the WP Fastest Cache plugin directly concatenates user-controlled input (`static::$id`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.
- The `set_id` method, which sets the `static::$id` property, uses `esc_sql()` on the input from `$_GET["post"]` but this does not prevent SQL injection. The `get_post_status()` function casts the ID to an integer, but the original string is passed to the vulnerable function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input before it's used in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Exposure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data from the WordPress database, including usernames, hashed passwords, and other privileged information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered via the `admin_notices` WordPress action, which calls the vulnerable function.
- The vulnerable parameter is `$_GET["post"]`, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user (at least subscriber role) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability requires the Classic Editor plugin to be installed and activated.
- The `get_post_status` function performs a check on the post ID, but this is insufficient to prevent SQL injection because the ID is cast to an int before the DB query, but the original uncasted string is concatenated to a query in the vulnerable code. An attacker could provide an ID like `1234 OR 1=1` to bypass this.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
