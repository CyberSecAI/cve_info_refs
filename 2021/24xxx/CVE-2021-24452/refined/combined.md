## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# W3 Total Cache < 2.1.5 - Reflected XSS in Extensions Page (JS Context)

### Description

The plugin was affected by a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the "extension" parameter in the Extensions dashboard, when the 'Anonymously track usage to improve product quality' setting is enabled, as the parameter is output in a JavaScript context without proper escaping. This could allow an attacker, who can convince an authenticated admin into clicking a link, to run malicious JavaScript within the user's web browser, which could lead to full site compromise.

### Proof of Concept

With the 'Anonymously track usage to improve product quality' settings (in the plugin General Settings) turned on, open the URL below
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=w3tc\_extensions&extension=%27-alert%28document.domain%29-%27
