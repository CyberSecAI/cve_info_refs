## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Business Hours Pro <= 5.5.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload to RCE

### Description

The plugin allows a remote attacker to upload arbitrary files using its manual update functionality, leading to an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability.

Note (WPScanTeam):

- The issue has been escalated to Envato on March 30th, 2021 and the plugin has been removed from the marketplace.

- The issue seems to be exploited since a few months by malicious actors, as some reviews/comments suggest (https://codecanyon.net/item/business-hours-pro-wordpress-plugin/reviews/9414879)

### Proof of Concept

The PoC will be displayed once the issue has been remediated.
