- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with contributor roles and above to access arbitrary post metadata.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect authorization leading to broken access control (CWE-863).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with contributor access can access metadata of other posts, including those belonging to administrators. This could potentially lead to information disclosure of sensitive data stored in metadata fields, such as API keys or internal configuration details.
- **Attack vectors**:  A contributor can use the `custom_field` shortcode, providing the `field` and `post_id` parameters to retrieve metadata from a specified post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to have a WordPress account with at least contributor role privileges to be able to create/edit post and use shortcodes.
