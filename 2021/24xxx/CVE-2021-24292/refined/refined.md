Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24292:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of server-side enforcement of HTML tag options within the "Card" widget and other similar widgets of the Happy Addons for Elementor plugin. These widgets allow users to select an HTML tag for titles or text formatting from a dropdown menu. However, the plugin doesn't prevent users from submitting arbitrary HTML tags (like `<script>`) through a 'save_builder' request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Malicious JavaScript can be injected by manipulating the "title_tag" parameter of vulnerable widgets (like 'Card', 'fun-factor', 'gradient-heading', 'icon-box', 'infobox', 'member', 'post-list', 'review', 'step-flow'). This script is then stored and executed when a page with the compromised widget is viewed, edited, or previewed.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied input for the "title_tag" and corresponding text parameters allowing arbitrary HTML tags and Javascript code to be injected.
*   **Insecure Implementation:**  The plugin's implementation of widgets that rely on user-defined HTML tags was not properly secured against malicious input, a common issue in Elementor add-on plugins.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of users who view the compromised pages.
*   **Site takeover:**  If an administrator views a compromised page, the attacker's injected script can be used to perform administrative actions or take over the entire site.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Lower-privileged users like contributors can inject malicious scripts and execute it on the browser of higher privileged users such as administrators leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Data theft/modification:**  The injected JavaScript could potentially be used to steal sensitive data, modify content, or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input Manipulation:** An attacker manipulates the 'save\_builder' request by changing the intended HTML tag (e.g., "H5") to a script tag (`<script>`) and adding the malicious javascript code within the "title" parameter.
*   **Widget-specific vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is found in multiple widgets that use similar logic, including "Card," "fun-factor," "gradient-heading," "icon-box," "infobox," "member," "post-list," "review," and "step-flow."

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker needs a user account with at least "contributor" access to the WordPress site to access the Elementor editor. This allows them to modify pages/posts and add/modify widgets.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameters ('title\_tag', and content parameters of specific widgets) and how to manipulate them.

**Additional notes**

*   The vulnerability is similar to those found in the main Elementor plugin, suggesting a widespread issue with how Elementor and its addons handle user-supplied HTML tags.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "medium" severity with a CVSS score of 6.4 (Wordfence) and 6.8 (WPScan).
