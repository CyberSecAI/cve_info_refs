## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Splash Header < 1.20.8 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

The plugin doesn't sanitise and escape some of its settings while outputting them in the admin dashboard, leading to an authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "Note title" and "Note message" settings of the plugin: "><script>alert(/XSS-Title/)</script> and </textarea><script>alert(/XSS-Msg/)</script>
Then visit the Admin Dashboard homepage or the plugin's settings (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=Splash\_Header\_Display&tab=homepage) to trigger the XSS
