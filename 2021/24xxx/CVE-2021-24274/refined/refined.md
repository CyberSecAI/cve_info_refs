Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24274:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Ultimate Maps by Supsystic" did not properly sanitize the `tab` parameter of its options page before outputting it in an HTML attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability lies in the fact that user-supplied input (the `tab` parameter) is reflected back in the page's HTML without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts, including:
  - Stealing session cookies
  - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
  - Defacing the website
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL targeting the WordPress admin page for the "Ultimate Maps by Supsystic" plugin.
- The `tab` parameter is modified with malicious Javascript code, that gets reflected back on the page leading to execution in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript in the `tab` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking on the crafted malicious URL while logged into the vulnerable wordpress install as an admin, to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable plugin version is prior to 1.2.5, which contains the fix.
- The vulnerability is classified as a reflected XSS, which is listed under OWASP top 10 A7 category.
- The assigned CWE ID is CWE-79.
