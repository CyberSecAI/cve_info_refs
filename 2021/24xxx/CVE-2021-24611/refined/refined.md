{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize or escape its settings before outputting them back in the page after they are saved.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of sanitization/escaping",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to missing CSRF checks"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected pages. An attacker can also use CSRF to make a logged in high-privilege user save arbitrary settings.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "By injecting malicious JavaScript code into plugin settings via a crafted form.",
    "By using a CSRF attack to make a logged in high privilege user save arbitrary setting."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious form and trick a logged-in high-privilege user to submit it, or be able to execute javascript on the page to initiate the request."
