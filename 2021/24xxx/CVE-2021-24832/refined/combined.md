## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP SEO Redirect 301 < 2.3.2 - Redirect Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF in place when deleting redirects, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin delete them via a CSRF attack

### Proof of Concept

https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-seo-redirect-301/seo\_redirect\_list.php&delete\_id=12&delete\_url=https://example.com/yolo
delete\_id is the post id, which is public and the delete\_url is the URL that redirects to the destination. So an attacker has all the info to exploit it

### Affects Plugins
