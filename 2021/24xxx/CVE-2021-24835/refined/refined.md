- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `withdrawal_vendor` parameter is not escaped before being used in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI), specifically within the `wcfm-withdrawal-reverse` controller.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification, or other malicious activities on the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a crafted `withdrawal_vendor` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a user with at least "Subscriber" privileges. The plugin also needs to be used in combination with another WCFM - WooCommerce Multivendor plugin.
