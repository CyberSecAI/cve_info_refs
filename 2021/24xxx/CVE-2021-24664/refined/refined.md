Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "WPSchoolPress" fails to properly escape user-supplied data before outputting it in HTML attributes, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. While the plugin sanitizes input using `sanitize_text_field()`, it does not escape it for HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in multiple input fields. The plugin sanitizes some fields but does not escape the values before rendering them within HTML attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into various parts of the WordPress admin panel.
- When a user views the affected pages, the injected JavaScript can execute, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Redirect the victim to malicious websites.
    - Deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the WordPress site
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript payloads into multiple input fields within the plugin's admin interface:
    - Teacher attendance "Reason" field
    - Student attendance "Reason" field
    - Subject Mark "Field"
    - Subject "Subject Name" field
    - Exam "Exam Name" field
- These malicious payloads are stored in the database
- When other administrators access the affected pages or edit the related information, the stored XSS payload is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the WordPress site. This means the attacker must have the ability to log into the WordPress dashboard with a user account that has the required permissions.

**Specific vulnerable locations:**
- `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sch-teacherattendance` (Reason field when adding teacher attendance)
- `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sch-attendance` (Reason field when adding student attendance)
- `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sch-settings&sc=subField` (Field when adding subject mark fields)
- `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sch-subject` (Subject Name field when adding a new subject)
- `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sch-exams` (Exam Name field when adding a new exam)

**More Details than CVE:**
- The provided content includes specific vulnerable input fields, and proof-of-concept XSS payloads for each field which is not typically included in the official CVE description.
- The content also includes specific WordPress admin URLs where the XSS payloads need to be inserted to trigger the vulnerability.
- It provides a detailed analysis of how the vulnerability occurs due to a lack of proper output escaping.
