### Summary:
The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Tutor LMS WordPress plugin, specifically in versions prior to 1.9.11.

### Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input before displaying it within HTML attributes on the Student Registration page.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin outputs user-provided input directly into HTML attributes without sanitization or escaping, allowing execution of malicious JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.

### Impact of exploitation:
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the Student Registration page.
- **Session Hijacking/Cookie Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies or session data.
- **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** An attacker could redirect users to phishing pages.
- **Defacement/Data Manipulation:** An attacker could alter the content of the page or potentially perform actions on behalf of the user.

### Attack vectors:
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The malicious script is injected via the `user_login` URL parameter in the Student Registration page. For example: `https://example.com/student-registration/?user_login="><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker would likely need to trick a user into clicking a crafted link.

### Required attacker capabilities/position:
- **Ability to craft malicious URL:** The attacker must be capable of crafting URLs with malicious JavaScript payload within URL parameters.
- **Social engineering/Phishing:** The attacker must have a way to deliver the malicious URL to the victim.
- **No authentication required:** The attack can be triggered without any authentication.

### Additional Notes
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.9.11.
- The provided changeset link shows the code changes made to fix the vulnerability, mainly by sanitizing the user input.
