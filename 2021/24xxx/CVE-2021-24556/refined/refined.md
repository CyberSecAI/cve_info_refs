Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization, validation, and escaping of the `subscribe_email` and `subscribe_name` POST parameters in the `kento_email_subscriber_ajax` AJAX action of the Email Subscriber plugin. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious input is saved in the database and later executed when an admin views the subscriber list.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input before storing it in the database.
*   **Lack of Output Encoding:** When displaying the stored data, the plugin fails to properly encode it, leading to the execution of the injected script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser when they access the subscriber list. This can lead to:
    *   **Account Takeover:** An attacker could steal the admin's session cookies, granting them complete control over the WordPress site.
    *   **Data Theft:** Sensitive data could be extracted from the WordPress admin panel.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could inject malicious scripts that infect the site's visitors.
    *   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via an AJAX request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker sends a POST request with the `action` parameter set to `kento_email_subscriber_ajax` and includes malicious JavaScript in the `subscribe_email` and/or `subscribe_name` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the malicious script. Any user can submit the vulnerable request.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know that `admin-ajax.php` is used and how to format the POST request with the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The malicious code is executed when the admin views the subscriber list. No specific interaction by the admin other than accessing the vulnerable page is required.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability affects version 1.1 and likely lower versions of the "Email Subscriber" plugin.
* The vulnerable code is located in `kento-email-subscribers-list.php`, specifically around line 61.
