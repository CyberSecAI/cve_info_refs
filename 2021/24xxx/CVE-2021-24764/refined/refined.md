- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape multiple parameters before outputting them in the admin dashboard. Specifically, the `id` and `filters[session_id]` parameters in the `single_statistics` page, and the `type` and `message` parameters in the `importexport` page are vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious URLs containing the vulnerable parameters and tricking an administrator into visiting the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick an administrator of the vulnerable WordPress site into accessing the malicious link while logged into the admin dashboard.
