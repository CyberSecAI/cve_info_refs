Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the WP Statistics plugin's insufficient handling of user-supplied input in a SQL query. Specifically, the plugin used `esc_sql()` on the `ID` parameter without proper quoting and did not use a prepared statement, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   Additionally, the vulnerable page was accessible to unauthenticated users, despite being intended for administrators only.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection, triggered by crafting malicious values for the `ID` and `type` parameters in the URL.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The use of `esc_sql()` without proper quoting and not using prepared statements was insufficient to prevent the SQL injection.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerable page (`wps_pages_page`) was accessible to unauthenticated users, expanding the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Extraction:** Attackers could use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including user emails, password hashes, encryption keys, and salts.
*   **Potential for Targeted Attacks:** The vulnerability could be used in targeted attacks to extract personally identifiable information from commerce sites.
*   **Slow Extraction:** The attack is time-based, making bulk extraction impractical, but targeted information can be extracted in hours with automated tools.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint, with the `page` parameter set to `wps_pages_page`, and malicious values supplied for the `ID` and `type` parameters.
    * Example URL: `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wps_pages_page&ID=0+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))SQLi)&type=home`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP GET requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of WP Statistics prior to 13.0.8.
*   The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.
*   Wordfence users are protected by their firewall's built-in SQL injection protection, which blocks most SQL injection attempts.
*   The vulnerability highlights the need to use prepared statements for SQL queries, instead of relying on input escaping or sanitization.

This information aligns with the provided CVE description in that it describes an SQL injection vulnerability in a WordPress plugin.
