- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize the `tab` parameter of its options page before outputting it in an HTML attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject arbitrary web scripts into a user's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code in the `tab` parameter, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability when a user accesses the vulnerable page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it. The user must be logged in to the WordPress admin panel for the attack to be successful.
