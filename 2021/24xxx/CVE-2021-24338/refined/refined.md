### CVE-2021-24338

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation of the `Singular Label` field parameter in the Pods WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is vulnerable to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can inject malicious code into the `Singular Label` field, which will then be executed when the affected page is rendered. This could allow the attacker to perform actions like redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, or performing administrative actions if a privileged user views the injected script.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the WordPress plugin. An attacker needs to be authenticated to access the Pods plugin settings page and to modify the `Singular Label` field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with the ability to edit Pods settings, meaning they must be an authenticated user with sufficient privileges.
