Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Target First WordPress plugin not sanitizing user-supplied input when setting the license key. The plugin takes the value of the `weeWzKey` POST parameter and saves it as the `weeID` option without any validation. Subsequently, this unsanitized `weeID` value is included in a JavaScript URL within the page footer, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unauthenticated Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored in the WordPress database.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize the `weeWzKey` parameter before saving it and displaying it in the page footer.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The license key update does not require any form of authentication or authorization, allowing unauthenticated users to modify the value of the `weeID` option.
*   **Direct Output Without Sanitization**: The plugin includes the `weeID` option directly in the page source code without sanitizing or encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of any user visiting the affected WordPress site.
*   **Account Hijacking:** Exploitation can allow an attacker to steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Malicious Redirects:**  An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could alter the content and appearance of the website.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker could launch phishing attacks by injecting malicious forms or prompts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to any URL on the vulnerable site, including a `weeWzKey` parameter with malicious JavaScript payload.
*   **JavaScript Injection via License Key:** The malicious payload is stored as the `weeID` option and is later rendered in the page footer within the JavaScript URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress website.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any prior knowledge of the website or any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
