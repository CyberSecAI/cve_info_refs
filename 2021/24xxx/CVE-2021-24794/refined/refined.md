- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to escape the Address settings when creating an entry.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the address fields of a directory entry. This script would then execute in the browsers of other users when they view the entry on the manage page.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding a malicious payload to the address line fields when creating an entry.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have admin or other high-privilege user access to create entries and inject malicious scripts. The `unfiltered_html` capability needs to be disabled for the XSS to be triggered, which is often the case for non-administrator high-privilege users.
