## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Connections Business Directory < 10.4.3 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape the Address settings when creating an Entry, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Add an Entry (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=connections\_add) and put the following payload in the Address Line fields: inval1d"><img src onerror=alert('xss')>
The XSS will be triggered when accessing Manage page (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=connections\_manage)
