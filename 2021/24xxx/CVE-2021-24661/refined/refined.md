- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "PostX Gutenberg Blocks Saved Templates Addon" plugin does not properly check user permissions when displaying content from saved templates. Specifically, it allows users with Contributor roles or higher to access the content of password-protected or private posts by embedding them in a saved template.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** The plugin discloses the content of private or password-protected posts to unauthorized users (Contributor roles or higher).
    - **Improper Access Control:** The plugin fails to enforce proper access controls when displaying post content within saved templates, allowing users to bypass intended visibility restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with Contributor roles or higher can read the content of private or password-protected posts created by other users. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information intended to be kept confidential.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user with Contributor roles or higher creating a saved template using the `[gutenberg_post_blocks id="POST_ID"]` shortcode, where `POST_ID` is the ID of a private or password-protected post. Previewing this template exposes the private content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have at least Contributor level access to the WordPress site.
    - The attacker needs to know the ID of the private or password-protected post they wish to access.
