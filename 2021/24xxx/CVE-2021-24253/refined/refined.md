- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate uploaded files during the "Add Listing" process. It only checks the `Content-Type` header of the request, which can be easily spoofed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Inadequate file validation, leading to arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
  - Lack of proper checks on the file content or extension
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Arbitrary PHP file upload, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
  - Attackers can gain full control of the vulnerable website.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Sending a crafted POST request to the `/add_a_listing/` endpoint with a malicious PHP file disguised as an image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker must be an authenticated user of the WordPress site. Any authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability.
