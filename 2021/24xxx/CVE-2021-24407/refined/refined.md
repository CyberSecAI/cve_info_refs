Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Jannah theme failed to properly sanitize the `query` POST parameter within its `tie_ajax_search` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the victim's browser when they visit a page with the vulnerable AJAX call or are tricked into making such a request. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting the victim to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious POST request to `/demo/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `tie_ajax_search` and the `query[]` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, they can initiate this request from anywhere that can access the vulnerable website. The user needs to be tricked into visiting a URL that makes this request or visiting a page that has the vulnerable Javascript.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter and the name of the vulnerable action, however, this can be learned from the source code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Jannah theme versions prior to 5.4.5
- The vulnerability is classified under OWASP A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CWE-79, and has a CVSS score of 7.1 (high).
- The vulnerability was discovered by Truoc Phan from Techlab Corporation.
