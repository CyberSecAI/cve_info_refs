## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Html5 Audio Player < 2.1.3 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or validate the parameters from its shortcode, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to set Cross-Site Scripting payload in them which will be triggered in the page/s with the embed malicious shortcode

### Proof of Concept

Log in as contributor and add the following shortcode in a page (there is no need to have an existing Audio Player): [player id="=0; alert(/XSS/);x"]
Then view the post to trigger the XSS
