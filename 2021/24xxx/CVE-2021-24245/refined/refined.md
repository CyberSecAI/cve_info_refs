{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin failed to properly escape user-controlled input when blocking requests, specifically when a spam word is detected. The input was sanitized by removing HTML tags but not sufficiently escaped before being output into an HTML attribute.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper output escaping"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the context of the user's browser session when they trigger the vulnerable code, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack can be carried out by sending a request with a spam word containing a malicious XSS payload, for example via the login form in the Username or Password fields.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable website. The attack does not require prior authentication. The user needs to trigger the vulnerability by accessing a page where the crafted input is reflected."
