Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24631

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization, validation, or escaping of the `did` GET parameter before it's used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs because user-supplied input (`did` parameter) is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query to perform malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete database information, leading to data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can use `SLEEP()` function to confirm the vulnerability and potentially extract database information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the WordPress admin panel with the `did` parameter included.
- **Vulnerable URL:** `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=popup&info=del&did=[MALICIOUS_SQL_CODE]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have at least "Editor" level access to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in the `popuplist.php` file, specifically at line 16:
```php
$delid = $_GET["did"];
$wpdb->query("delete from " . $table_name . " where id=" . $delid);
```
This code retrieves the `did` parameter from the URL and directly inserts it into the SQL `DELETE` query without any prior checks.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
The provided PoC shows how to use a SQL injection payload to insert a `SLEEP` function in the SQL query using the `did` parameter which can confirm the vulnerability and be further exploited.
```
GET /wp-admin/admin.php?page=popup&info=del&did=1 AND (SELECT 4420 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))yVXX)
```
**Affected Plugin Version:**
-  Unlimited PopUps <= 4.5.3 (and likely lower versions)

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was identified by Shreya Pohekar of Codevigilant Project.
- The vulnerability is classified as OWASP A1: Injection and CWE-89.
- CVSS score is 8.2 (High).
- The plugin was closed after the vulnerability was disclosed, meaning no fix was ever released.
