Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24160:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability checks within the `rmp_upload_theme` function in the Responsive Menu plugin. This function allows users to upload and extract zip files to the `/rmp-menu/themes/` directory. Because no checks were in place, any authenticated user, including low-level users such as subscribers, could trigger this functionality via the admin-post.php endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Authenticated Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for any authenticated user to upload arbitrary files via a zip archive.
*   **Missing Capability Check:** The function lacks a check to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to upload themes, allowing even low-level users to trigger the file upload and extraction.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a zip archive containing malicious PHP files, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
*   **Site Takeover:** Successful RCE can lead to a complete site takeover, allowing attackers to inject backdoors, spam, malicious redirects, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` endpoint.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the target WordPress site, even with low-level privileges like a subscriber.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **User Account:** The attacker needs to have an account on the target WordPress site (subscriber role is sufficient).
*   **Network access:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the target site.
*   **Malicious Zip Archive:** The attacker needs to create a zip archive containing malicious PHP files that can be executed after extraction.

**Additional Details:**
*   The `admin_post` action that triggers the file upload only checks if the user is sending a request to the administrative page `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` while authenticated and not the user capabilities.
*   The vulnerability was present in versions 4.0.0 through 4.0.3 of the plugin and was fixed in version 4.0.4.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is provided in the first document to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is related to other vulnerabilities in the plugin (CVE-2021-24161 and CVE-2021-24162) which are about Cross-Site Request Forgery.
