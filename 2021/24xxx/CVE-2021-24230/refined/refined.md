Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2021-24230:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Patreon WordPress plugin had a missing CSRF protection on the `toggle_option` function. This function allows users to modify their user metadata.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The lack of nonce validation in the `toggle_option` function allows attackers to forge requests on behalf of logged-in users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary User Meta Overwrite/Creation:** Attackers can overwrite or create arbitrary user metadata.
- **Account Lockout:** By overwriting the `wp_capabilities` meta key, which stores user roles and privileges, attackers can lock users out of their accounts, preventing them from accessing paid content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious link containing a request that, when clicked by a logged-in user, triggers the vulnerable `toggle_option` function.
- The victim must be logged in and have an active session on the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and distribute a malicious URL to the victim.
- The attacker needs no prior knowledge of the victim's user meta data.
- The attacker does not need to have an account on the targeted WordPress instance.
