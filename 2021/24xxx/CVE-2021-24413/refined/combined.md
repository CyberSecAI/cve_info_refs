## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Twitter Feed < 1.2 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or validate the parameters from its shortcode, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to set Cross-Site Scripting payload in them which will be triggered in the page/s with the embed malicious shortcode

### Proof of Concept

Log in as contributor and add the following shortcode in a post [timeline username='" onmousemove="alert(/XSS/)" data-xss="']
Then view the post and move the mouse over the generated link to trigger the XSS
