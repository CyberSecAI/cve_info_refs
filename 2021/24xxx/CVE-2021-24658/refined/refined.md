Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in its settings. Specifically, it doesn't sanitize data before saving it into the database and rendering it in admin screens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows high-privilege users (administrators) to inject malicious JavaScript code into plugin settings, which will be stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the plugin's settings page in the WordPress dashboard, as well as on the login screen and potentially other admin pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially:
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Steal administrator session cookies.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the administrator.
    - Modify website content.
    - Compromise the entire WordPress installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Settings:** An attacker with administrator privileges can inject XSS payloads into various plugin settings, such as the "Powered by Text" input field.
- **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and executed when an admin views the affected settings page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator access:** The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard to modify the plugin settings.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable input fields:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable setting fields within the plugin.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of the "Erident Custom Login and Dashboard" plugin prior to 3.5.9.
- The fix involves sanitizing user input using `filter_input_array` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by James Calver of Bulletproof Cyber.
