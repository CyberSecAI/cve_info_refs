Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `token_error` parameter in the plugin's settings page is directly echoed in the HTML output without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `token_error` parameter, which is then executed in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - Cookie theft and session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - Other malicious actions by leveraging the admin user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request to the plugin settings page.
- The crafted URL includes the malicious payload in the `token_error` parameter.
- **Example URL:** `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=settings-wisw&token_error=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim (a WordPress administrator) into clicking the crafted URL. This could be done through phishing or other social engineering techniques.
- The victim must be an authenticated user with access to the plugin settings page (typically an administrator).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.8.5 of the plugin by implementing sanitization of the input.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.6 (Critical).
- The vulnerability requires user interaction.
- The vulnerability affects WordPress administrators who have access to the plugin settings page.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79.
