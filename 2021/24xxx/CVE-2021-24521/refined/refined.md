Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to sanitize, validate, or escape the `id` GET parameter before using it in an SQL query within the `side-menu-lite/admin/partials/include-data.php` file. Specifically, when the `act` parameter equals `duplicate`, the `id` parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, manipulating the database query. This is a classic example of an SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete database information. In the provided proof of concept, the attacker injects a `sleep(5)` command which results in a server delay as an easily observable effect to demonstrate the ability to inject SQL code.
- The potential impact depends on the database privileges of the user running the SQL queries, which, if it is a privileged user, could lead to complete compromise of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the WordPress admin panel (`/wp-admin/admin.php`) with specific parameters.
- The `page`, `tab`, `act`, and `id` parameters are manipulated to trigger the vulnerable code path.
- Specifically, setting `act` to `duplicate` and injecting SQL code into the `id` parameter exploits the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Administrator or user with permission to manage the plugin:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or have the specific permission to manage the Side Menu Lite plugin to access the vulnerable part of the code.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress installation to send the malicious requests.

**Additional details:**
- The specific vulnerable code is located in `/side-menu-lite/admin/partials/include-data.php`.
- The plugin version affected is `Side Menu Lite <= 2.2.1`.
- The fix was implemented in version `2.2.1`.
