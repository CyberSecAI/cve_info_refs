- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The HD Quiz plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied answers before embedding them within HTML attributes when generating quizzes. Specifically, user-provided input for question answers in "Multiple Choice: Text" questions are not being escaped, leading to injection of arbitrary code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the quiz answers. When a user views a page containing the embedded quiz, this code will execute in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating or editing a quiz and inserting the malicious payload within the answers to a "Multiple Choice: Text" question.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the WordPress dashboard to create or modify quizzes.
