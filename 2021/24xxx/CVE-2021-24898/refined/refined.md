- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize or escape user-supplied input in Table Name, Column Name, and Column Label fields before rendering it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser when they view the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to create or edit a table with malicious JavaScript in one of the vulnerable fields via the WordPress admin interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator or high privilege access to WordPress.
