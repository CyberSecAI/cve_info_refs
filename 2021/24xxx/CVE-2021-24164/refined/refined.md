{
  "CVE-2021-24164": {
    "root_cause": "The `wp_ajax_nf_oauth` AJAX action, used to retrieve the connection URL for establishing an OAuth connection with the Ninja Forms Add-On Management portal, lacks a capability check. ",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Missing capability check on the `wp_ajax_nf_oauth` AJAX action allows low-level users to trigger the action and obtain sensitive information."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could obtain the connection URL and client_id, potentially leading to establishing an OAuth connection for the vulnerable WordPress site with their own account and installing any purchased Add-On plugins. However, this would require social engineering to trick the site administrator into updating the client_id in the database.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker with low-level access (e.g., subscriber) can make an AJAX request to `wp_ajax_nf_oauth` to retrieve the connection URL and client_id."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker requires a low-level account (e.g., subscriber) on the affected WordPress site."
