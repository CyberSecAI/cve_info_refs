## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Insert Pages < 3.7.0 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin adds a shortcode that prints out other pages' content and custom fields. It can be used by users with a role as low as Contributor to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks by storing the payload/s in another post's custom fields.

### Proof of Concept

- Create a page A
- Add a custom field containing JS in Page A
- Create page B
- add shortcode to page B: [insert page="page\_A\_slug" display="all"]
