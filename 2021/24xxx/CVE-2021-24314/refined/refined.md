- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The theme failed to sanitize, validate, or escape the `keywords` GET parameter on its listing page before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or perform other malicious actions. The CVSS score of 10.0 indicates a critical severity, with high impacts to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/tour-list/` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `keywords` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely, as the attack vector is over the network.
