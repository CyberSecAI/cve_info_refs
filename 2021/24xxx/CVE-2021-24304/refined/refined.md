- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Newsmag theme fails to sanitize the `td_block_id` parameter within its `td_ajax_block` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, potentially leading to actions on behalf of the victim, such as session hijacking, stealing credentials, or modifying page content.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable parameter `td_block_id`, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability is only exploitable for unauthenticated users due to a nonce check.
