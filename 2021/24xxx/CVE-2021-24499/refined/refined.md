Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-24499:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The WordPress theme "Workreap" by Amentotech had vulnerable AJAX endpoints that did not perform nonce checks or validate user requests. Specifically, the `workreap_award_temp_file_uploader` and `workreap_temp_file_uploader` actions were vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload:** The vulnerable AJAX actions allowed any unauthenticated user to upload files to the `uploads/workreap-temp` directory.
*   **Lack of file sanitization/validation:** Uploaded files were not sanitized or validated, allowing for the upload of executable files (like PHP scripts).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could upload and execute malicious code (like PHP scripts), leading to full site takeover.
*   **Complete Site Takeover:** The RCE vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the affected website.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to either `workreap_award_temp_file_uploader` or `workreap_temp_file_uploader` and includes a malicious file.
*   **Direct File Access:** Once the file is uploaded, the attacker can access and execute it via a direct HTTP request to its location within the `uploads/workreap-temp` directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any user privileges on the website.
*   **Network access:** The attacker only needs to have network access to the vulnerable website.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is assigned a CVSSv3.1 score of 10.0, indicating a critical severity.
*   The vulnerability is related to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-641 (Improper Restriction of Namespaces).
*   The fix for the vulnerability is included in version 2.2.2 of the Workreap theme.
*  The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Harald Eilertsen of the Jetpack team.
