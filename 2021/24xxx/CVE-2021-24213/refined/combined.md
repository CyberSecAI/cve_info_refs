# [CVE-2021-24213: GiveWP <= 2.9.7 Reflected Cross Site Scripting](https://bentl.ee/posts/cve-givewp/)

During source code review, I noticed a XSS vulnerability in the 2.9.7 version of the GiveWP WordPress plugin. It appears to have been vulnerable since 2.4.0. It has been fixed in 2.10.0.

# [SELinux: Creating a Policy From Scratch](https://bentl.ee/posts/selinux-p0-creating-a-policy-from-scratch/)

Too many SELinux tutorials are too basic or too complicated. This tutorial aims to meet a middle ground. If you don’t know how to tweak booleans in SELinux, or about permissive/enforced mode, you might want to follow another tutorial and come back here later. This tutorial is for when you have some basic SELinux knowledge and want to create your own policy!

# [Migrating to OpenBSD From Linux: Installation, Packages, Services](https://bentl.ee/posts/migrating-to-openbsd-from-linux-p2/)

Since OpenBSD is different from the other \*nixes, we’re going to take a quick peek at installing OpenBSD, performing package installations, and service management.

# [Migrating to OpenBSD: Understanding OpenBSD](https://bentl.ee/posts/migrating-to-openbsd-from-linux/)

The most touted claim about OpenBSD is it’s security – and it’s definitely a great point. I think that can scare some beginners though. I don’t want people to think of this only as a hardened, pain in the ass to use UNIX. It’s not.

# [OpenBSD UPS Setup](https://bentl.ee/posts/openbsd-ups-setup/)

I recently purchased a CyberPower CST135XLU for my OpenBSD router and home computer. The main reason being that I do not want corrupted flash sectors whenever the power goes out due to a storm or snow. Not to mention, multiyear uptime is always a badge of honor!

# [CVE-2021-24213: GiveWP <= 2.9.7 Reflected Cross Site Scripting](https://bentl.ee/posts/cve-givewp/)

During source code review, I noticed a XSS vulnerability in the 2.9.7 version of the GiveWP WordPress plugin. It appears to have been vulnerable since 2.4.0. It has been fixed in 2.10.0.

# Proof of Concept

```
http://localhost/wp-admin/edit.php?s=%22%3E<script>alert(0)</script>&start-date&end-date&form_id=0&action=-1&paged=1&give_action=delete_bulk_donor&orderby=id&order=DESC&action2=-1&post_type=give_forms&page=give-donors&view=donors

```
# Impact

As of this writing, GiveWP is installed on [100,000+ WP instances](https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/). This vulnerability has been present [since at least 2.4.0 (Jan 16th 2019)](https://github.com/impress-org/givewp/commit/097c4d0ab964493776950381ed64498040395f6b). It may have been present earlier in another form. This vulnerability requires user interaction from an admin in order to be exploited.

# Resolution

Install GiveWP 2.10.0 to remediate this issue. After I notified GiveWP, they released a fix the same day, around 8 hours later.

# Analysis

In `class-donor-table.php`, we can see the source of the vulnerable parameter does not have any form of sanitation applied:
![GiveWP source](/cve/givewp-source.png)

We can identify in the sink that the above source is called directly. No sanitation is applied before the sink:
![GiveWP sink](/cve/givewp-sink.png)

We can identify that the sink is later included in `donors.php`. This page is visible to administrators at `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=give_forms&page=give-donors`:
![GiveWP donors.php](/cve/givewp-donors.png)

To confirm the vulnerability, a request was crafted in Burp Suite: (payload highlighted)
![Burp request](/cve/givewp-burp-request.png)

We can then see the payload reflected in the response:
![Burp response](/cve/givewp-burp-response.png)

# Testing Setup

* GiveWP 2.9.7
* WordPress 5.7
* XAMPP 7.4.16
* Firefox 86.0.1
* Default configurations on all products

# Disclosure Log

```
