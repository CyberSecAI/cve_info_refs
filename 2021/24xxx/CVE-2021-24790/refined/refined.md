{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks in its `delete_cf7_data` and `export_cf7_data` AJAX actions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Missing authorization checks",
    "Missing CSRF checks",
    "PHP Object Injection via `maybe_unserialize()`"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary metadata deletion and potential PHP Object Injection, leading to arbitrary code execution if a suitable gadget chain is present in another plugin.",
  "Attack vectors": "Unauthenticated AJAX calls to the `delete_cf7_data` and `export_cf7_data` actions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated user, with a role as low as a subscriber, is required to exploit the vulnerability."
