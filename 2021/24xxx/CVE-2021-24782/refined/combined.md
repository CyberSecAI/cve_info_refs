## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Flex Local Fonts <= 1.0.0 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site-Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape the Class Name field when adding a font, which could allow hight privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Add a new font (Tools --> Local Fonts --> Add Font, need to have at least one font for the 'Add Font' to show up), put the following payload in the Class Name field (will trigger a self-XSS): <script>alert(/XSS/)</script> and save the change. The XSS will be triggered on the plugin's settings page (/wp-admin/tools.php?page=fsflex-local-fonts)

### Affects Plugins
