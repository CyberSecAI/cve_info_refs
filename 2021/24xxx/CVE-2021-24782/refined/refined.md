- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input in the "Class Name" field when adding a new font.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of sanitization allows malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the database and executed in the user's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts that could lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection of users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (Admin+) to access the plugin settings page and add new fonts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have at least administrative access to the WordPress site. The attacker inputs the malicious script in the 'Class Name' field when adding a new font within the plugin settings. The payload will be executed when an administrator accesses the plugin's settings page.
