```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The AJAX action `cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback` in multiple WP-Buy plugins lacks proper access controls, allowing low-privileged users to install and activate arbitrary plugins.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Broken Access Control",
    "Improper Authorization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can install and activate any plugin from the WordPress repository, including vulnerable ones, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other critical vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=do_button_job_later` parameter, and specifying the `slug` (for install) or `plugin_file` (for activate) parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a low-privileged user account on the WordPress site. No further capabilities are mentioned beyond having this user account."
