Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2005-2090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper handling of multiple `Content-Length` headers in HTTP requests. Some web servers and other HTTP processing components might interpret and handle these multiple headers differently.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The core vulnerability is HTTP request smuggling, which arises from discrepancies in how different HTTP devices (like firewalls, caches, proxies, and web servers) parse and interpret malformed HTTP requests, particularly those with multiple `Content-Length` headers.
- **Multiple Content-Length Headers:** The vulnerability stems from the failure of some HTTP devices to reject requests that contain more than one `Content-Length` header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Web Cache Poisoning:** An attacker can manipulate the cache server into associating a URL with the content of a different URL. This can result in serving the wrong content to users.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By manipulating the response, an attacker can inject arbitrary content into the HTTP response. This could lead to XSS attacks where malicious scripts are executed on the client's browser.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Bypass:**  Attackers could bypass security measures by smuggling malicious requests (e.g., worms, buffer overflows) past a WAF, directly targeting the web server.
- **Session Hijacking:** Manipulating the request/response sequence may permit session hijacking, enabling the attacker to impersonate a user with valid credentials.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTTP Requests:** The primary attack vector involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests containing multiple `Content-Length` headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a system that includes intermediary components that handle these headers differently. This typically involves targeting a system that uses a combination of load balancers, proxies, or caches with different parsing behaviors, along with the vulnerable web server (e.g., Tomcat).
- No specific user privileges on the target server are required. The vulnerability can be exploited through normal network traffic, allowing a remote attacker to trigger it.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs because different components in the HTTP request flow may make different decisions about which content-length header to use.
- Some servers incorrectly handle a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain multiple `Content-Length` headers.
- Tomcat has been updated to return a 400 error for requests containing multiple content-length headers.
- The fix involves checking for multiple `Content-Length` headers and rejecting such requests with a "400 Bad Request" response.
-  The issue can be mitigated when a reverse proxy is configured to properly handle the multiple `Content-Length` headers, thus preventing the crafted request from reaching the backend server.
