Package        : netpbm-free
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-2978

A buffer overflow has been identified in the pnmtopng component of the
netpbm package, a set of graphics conversion tools.  This
vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as a
local user by providing a specially crafted PNM file.

The old stable distribution (woody) it not vulnerable to this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0-8sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0-10.

We recommend that you upgrade your netpbm-free packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Netpbm: Buffer overflow in pnmtopng — GLSA **200510-18**

The pnmtopng utility, part of the Netpbm tools, contains a vulnerability
which can potentially result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/netpbm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **10.29** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **10.29**revision >= **10.26.32**revision >= **10.26.33**revision >= **10.26.42**revision >= **10.26.43**revision >= **10.26.44**revision >= **10.26.48**revision >= **10.26.49**revision >= **10.26.52**revision >= **10.26.53**revision >= **10.26.59**revision >= **10.26.61** |

### Background

Netpbm is a package of 220 graphics programs and a programming library,
including pnmtopng, a tool to convert PNM image files to the PNG
format.

### Description

RedHat reported that pnmtopng is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

### Impact

An attacker could craft a malicious PNM file and entice a user to run
pnmtopng on it, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running pnmtopng.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Netpbm users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose media-libs/netpbm
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I'm not sure which version of netpbm you're running as the version shipped in RHEL4 doesn't seem to match up when I look at the line numbers gdb is reporting.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=168278#c6)  Josh Bressers    2005-09-15 13:37:52 UTC  ``` Additionally, if this issue is caused by an OOB read and has no potential for exploitation, it will not be considered a security issue.  We do not consider crashes of userland programs such as this security issues (the user is running it interactively so if it crashes a few times, they'll figure out it's just a broken image file).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=168278#c7)  Jindrich Novy    2005-09-15 16:50:02 UTC  ``` Josh,  I discussed this with Bastien and it seems the error is present at least in RHEL4 and rawhide netpbm (10.29-1). The gdb dump above in [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=168278#c4) is done from pnmtopng present in netpbm-10.29-1, where something seems seriously broken, as the crash is caused by call of makePngLine(), but it segfaults even before the code within the makePngLine() is executed (likely somewhere in the calling convention stuff or similar).

Furthermore it doesn't initialize bestIndex, so that in case paletteSize==0 (paletteSize is uninitialized) it returns uninitialized output to bestIndexP, what could be likely another source of segfault:      unsigned int paletteIndex;     unsigned int bestIndex;     unsigned int bestMatch;      bestMatch = UINT_MAX;      for (paletteIndex = 0; paletteIndex < paletteSize; ++paletteIndex) {         unsigned int const dist =             PPM_DISTANCE(palette_pnm[paletteIndex], targetColor);          if (dist < bestMatch) {             bestMatch = dist;             bestIndex = paletteIndex;         }     }     if (bestIndexP != NULL)         *bestIndexP = bestIndex;     if (bestMatchP != NULL)         *bestMatchP = bestMatch;    ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=168278#c9)  Jindrich Novy    2005-09-19 07:55:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 118961](attachment.cgi?id=118961&action=diff "Patch to fix the segfault.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=118961&action=edit "Patch to fix the segfault.") Patch to fix the segfault.  Josh, Mark,  maybe this is also dangerous from the security point of view. If you consider that the palette array that is indexed by the uninitialized variable is not allocated by malloc, but is a local array of convertpnm(), therefore it's allocated on stack. If an attacker could make the uninitialized paletteSize=0 (what is likely the case of i386 - this is the reason why it doesn't segfault there) and make bestIndex to be initialized by something he wants, he can swap any pixel sized memory on the stack, because this code is executed right after the closestColorInPalette() call that returns the uninitialized bestIndex in transparentIndex variable:  	/* Swap this with the first entry in the palette */ 	pixel tmp;  	tmp = palette_pnm[transparentIndex]; 	palette_pnm[transparentIndex] = palette_pnm[0]; 	palette_pnm[0] = tmp;  One can make a lot by modifying the stack contents...   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=168278#c10)  Josh Bressers    2005-09-28 20:37:53 UTC  ``` Yes, we're going to want to fix this as a security update.  Does this affect everything we ship?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=168278#c11)  Jindrich Novy    2005-09-29 09:16:46 UTC  ``` There's a different implementation of pnmtopng in netpbm-9.24 RHEL3 and RHEL2.1 that doesn't seem to be broken (I tested this case on the both RHELs and everything is fine) so the only affected is RHEL4 from RHELs and all currently supported Fedora Cores.  I applied patch to RHEL4 and errata is comming soon.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=168278#c15)  Josh Bressers    2005-10-18 15:28:09 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=168278#c16)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2005-10-18 15:41:58 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.
