Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2831:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability, identified as "COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability," is present in Microsoft Internet Explorer. It arises from the way Internet Explorer instantiates Component Object Model (COM) objects that are not intended to be used within the browser's environment. By exploiting this flaw, a remote attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the targeted system.

**Root Cause:**

The core issue lies in Internet Explorer's attempt to instantiate COM objects, some of which are not designed to function properly within the browser environment. This can lead to memory corruption during the instantiation process, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unsafe COM Object Instantiation:** Internet Explorer attempts to instantiate COM objects that are not designed for use within the browser, and lack proper checks to prevent these unsafe objects from being instantiated.
- **Memory Corruption:** Improper instantiation of certain COM objects can corrupt memory, which allows for arbitrary code execution by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.
- **Full System Control:** With successful code execution, an attacker can take full control of the compromised system, enabling them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage specifically crafted to exploit the vulnerability, and then attempts to convince users to visit it.
-   **Email-based attack**: An attacker embeds the exploit in an HTML email message.
-   **Compromised Advertisements:** Attackers may leverage malicious banner ads to serve the exploit through reputable websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely via web pages or email without needing to be on the same network as the victim.
-   **Social Engineering:** Attackers must use social engineering techniques to persuade users to interact with the malicious web page or email to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
The Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-054 lists the Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) and corresponding COM objects that are affected by this vulnerability. This update sets the "kill bit" for the listed CLSIDs to prevent them from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
The identified vulnerable CLSIDs include:
