How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## pam\_ldap authentication bypass vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#778916

Original Release Date: 2005-08-24 | Last Revised: 2005-11-02

---

### Overview

An error in the pam\_ldap password policy control may allow a remote attacker to gain access to a system.

### Description

| pam\_ldap provides LDAP authentication services for UNIX-based systems. A vulnerability in pam\_ldap may allow a remote attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism. If a pam\_ldap client attempts to authenticate against an LDAP server that omits the optional error value from the PasswordPolicyResponseValue, the authentication attempt will always succeed.  Note that this vulnerability affects all versions of pam\_ldap since version pam\_ldap-169. However, if the underlying LDAP client library does not support LDAP version 3 controls, then this vulnerability is not present. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker may be able to bypass the pam\_ldap authentication mechanism and gain access to a system, possibly with elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade pam\_ldap**  This vulnerability was corrected in [pam\_ldap-180](http://www.padl.com/OSS/pam_ldap.html). |
