- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `wce.download.php` script does not properly validate the "download" parameter, allowing it to be manipulated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can download arbitrary files from the vulnerable server, potentially including sensitive configuration files or other critical data.
- **Attack vectors:**  By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a modified `download` parameter that uses path traversal sequences such as `../`, an attacker can access files outside of the intended download directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, implying a remote attacker capability.
