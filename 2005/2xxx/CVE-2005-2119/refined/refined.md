    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2005-2119",
      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Summary": "The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.",
      "Root_Cause": "An unchecked buffer in the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) allows for a buffer overflow.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution, local elevation of privilege, complete control of the affected system.",
      "Attack_Vectors": [
        "Specially crafted network message sent to the affected system via port 3372/tcp and a dynamic high TCP port"
      ],
      "Attacker_Capabilities": "Remote unauthenticated access on Windows 2000 systems. On Windows XP SP1 and Server 2003, local authenticated access is needed, though remote unauthenticated access becomes possible if the MSDTC Network DTC Access is enabled and the service is started by any local user.",
    "Affected_Systems":[
        "Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4",
        "Microsoft Windows XP SP1",
        "Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition",
        "Microsoft Windows Server 2003",
        "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP1",
        "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems",
        "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems",
        "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition"

    ],
    "Non_Affected_Systems":[
        "Microsoft Windows XP SP2",
        "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP1"
      ],
    "Additional_Details": "This vulnerability is addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-051, which includes updates to prevent the buffer overflow. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely on Windows 2000, but requires local access on Windows XP SP1 and Windows Server 2003 unless the service is started or Network DTC Access is enabled. Firewall best practices, disabling MSDTC, or disabling Network DTC Access can help to prevent exploitation."
