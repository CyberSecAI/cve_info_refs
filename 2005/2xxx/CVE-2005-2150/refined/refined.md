Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-2150

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the combination of two factors:

1.  **Hardcoded Named Pipes for NULL Sessions:** Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 allow connections using certain hardcoded named pipes without requiring authentication (NULL sessions).
2.  **MSRPC Endpoint Accessibility:** The Microsoft RPC (MSRPC) default behavior allows all available RPC interfaces within a process to be accessed via any open endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **svcctl vulnerability:** Exploitation of the `svcctl` MSRPC interface, which is used to communicate with the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM).
*   **eventlog vulnerability:** Exploitation of the `eventlog` MSRPC interface, which is used to communicate with the Windows Event Log service.
*   **Weak DACLs on Services:**  Some services might have weak Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs) that allow the `EVERYONE` group to start or stop them. In Windows NT 4.0 and 2000, `EVERYONE` includes the `ANONYMOUS LOGON SID`, permitting anonymous actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Anonymous Service Enumeration:** Attackers can anonymously enumerate Windows services running on affected systems.
*   **Remote Service Manipulation:**  If a service has a weak DACL, attackers can anonymously start or stop it.
*   **Anonymous Event Log Reading:** Attackers can anonymously read Application and System event logs. Note that the Security event log cannot be accessed this way due to privilege requirements.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network-based attacks using MSRPC over named pipes.
*   Exploitation of NULL session connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the target system.
*   No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*  Knowledge of MSRPC and named pipe usage.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory notes that while Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 aren't directly affected by the specific *vulnerabilities* described, the alternate named pipes technique can be applied to them.
*   Fixes for the vulnerabilities in Windows 2000 are provided in the Update Rollup Package 1 (URP1) for Windows 2000 SP4. The SCM DACL was modified to deny access to the ANONYMOUS LOGON SID. The Eventlog vulnerability was fixed by using an RPC callback function to reject unauthenticated binds.
*   A workaround for the eventlog vulnerability is mentioned, involving setting the RestrictGuestAccess registry value.
*   Nessus plugins exist to detect vulnerable hosts for both the svcctl and eventlog vulnerabilities.
