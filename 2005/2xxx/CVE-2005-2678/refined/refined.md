Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft IIS (versions 5.0, 5.1, and 6.0) handles the `SERVER_NAME` server variable in HTTP requests. The server variable is intended to return the server's host name, DNS alias, or IP address. However, it can be manipulated through a specially crafted HTTP request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SERVER_NAME Spoofing:** The core weakness is that an attacker can remotely spoof the `SERVER_NAME` variable, causing it to return an arbitrary value instead of the actual server's hostname or IP.
*   **Reliance on SERVER_NAME for Authentication/Authorization:** Applications and services that rely on the `SERVER_NAME` variable for authentication or authorization decisions can be bypassed. Specifically, it is noted that some applications use the `SERVER_NAME` value of “localhost” as proof the user is accessing the application from the server itself. 
*   **Information Disclosure:** If the `SERVER_NAME` variable is "localhost", the IIS 500-100.asp error page will display sensitive ASP code when an error occurs. By spoofing the `SERVER_NAME` variable to "localhost", an attacker can force the server to disclose this information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially reveal sensitive ASP code through the IIS error page.
*   **Bypass Authentication:** Spoofing the `SERVER_NAME` variable can bypass authentication checks in web applications or services that rely on this variable's validity.
*   **Potential Exploits in Third-Party Applications:** The vulnerability can lead to a range of exploits in third-party web applications and web services due to incorrect assumptions about the variable's value.
*   **Cookie Stealing, Data Redirection, URL Manipulation:** The incorrect `SERVER_NAME` value can lead to other exploits as the variable is often used to determine the IP address of the web server itself.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Modified HTTP Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request from a remote client. The specifics of this modified request are not detailed, but it is what allows an attacker to spoof the `SERVER_NAME` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the vulnerable IIS server.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests that can manipulate the `SERVER_NAME` variable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Microsoft IIS versions 5.0, 5.1, and 6.0 on various Windows platforms, including Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP Professional SP2, and Windows 2003 SP1.
*   The advisory mentions that Microsoft was notified of the vulnerability on January 28, 2005.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via languages like ASP using `request.servervariables("SERVER_NAME")` and .NET using `HttpContext.Current.Request.ServerVariables("SERVER_NAME")`
