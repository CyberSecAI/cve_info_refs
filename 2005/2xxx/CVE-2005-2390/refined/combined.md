How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package:             proftpd
Vulnerability:       denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:           Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= proftpd-1.3.0rc1-20050610 >= proftpd-1.3.0rc2-20050725
OpenPKG 2.4          <= proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.0    >= proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.1
OpenPKG 2.3          <= proftpd-1.2.10-2.3.1      >= proftpd-1.2.10-2.3.2

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  It was reported that ProFTPd [[1]](#1) version before 1.3.0rc2 suffer from
  two format string vulnerabilities. In the first, a user with the
  ability to create a directory could trigger the format string error
  if there is a ProFTPd shutdown message configured to use the "%C",
  "%R", or "%U" variables. In the second, the error is triggered if the
  ProFTPd extension mod_sql is used to retrieve messages from a database
  and if format strings have been inserted into the database by a user
  with permission to do so. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2005-2390 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q proftpd". If you have the "proftpd" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][[8]](#8) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[9]](#9), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.4, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.4/UPD
  ftp> get proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.1.*.rpm
