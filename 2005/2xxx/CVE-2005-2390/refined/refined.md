Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2390:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from two format string flaws in ProFTPd.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is a format string bug. This occurs when user-controlled data is used as a format string in a logging or message function.
  - The first vulnerability can be triggered by a user creating a directory if specific format string variables (%C, %R, or %U) are used in the ProFTPd shutdown message configuration.
  - The second vulnerability is triggered when the `mod_sql` extension is used to retrieve messages from a database and format strings are inserted into the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The exploitation of these vulnerabilities leads to a denial-of-service condition. This means an attacker can crash the ProFTPd service making it unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Directory Creation:** For the first vulnerability, an attacker needs the ability to create directories on the server to trigger a format string error.
- **Database Manipulation:** For the second vulnerability, an attacker needs permission to insert format strings into the database that the `mod_sql` extension uses to fetch messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For the first vulnerability: Requires a user with the ability to create a directory.
- For the second vulnerability: Requires a user with permissions to modify the SQL database that ProFTPd is using, specifically where server messages are stored.

**Additional notes:**
- The advisory references the CVE ID CAN-2005-2390 (which is now CVE-2005-2390)
- The advisory specifically mentions that OpenPKG is affected.
- The advisory also provides a detailed solution with specific steps for upgrading the vulnerable packages.
