  "CVE-2005-2126": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Windows FTP client does not properly validate file names that are received from FTP servers.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A tampering vulnerability exists in the Windows FTP client due to improper validation of file names received from FTP servers. This could allow an attacker to modify the intended destination location for a file transfer.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could save files to specific locations on an affected system, potentially leading to further attacks. For example, an executable could be placed in the 'Startup' folder for execution upon the user's next login. Arbitrary code execution may be possible by exploiting this vulnerability.",
       "Attack vectors": "An attacker could host a file with a specially crafted name on an FTP server. The attacker must then persuade a user to download this file from the malicious FTP server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious file with a crafted filename on an FTP server and persuade the victim to download the file using the vulnerable Windows FTP client. No special privileges are needed on the target machine, as the vulnerability is exploited through client-side actions."
    },
    {
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "Input validation error in the Microsoft Windows FTP Client.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Microsoft Windows FTP Client does not properly validate the names of received files. This allows a remote attacker to write files to arbitrary locations.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker may be able to write files to arbitrary locations on a vulnerable system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if the attacker places a malicious executable in a location like the Startup folder.",
      "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker persuades a user to download a file with a specially crafted name using the Windows FTP Client.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a file with a crafted filename on an FTP server and persuade a user to download this file."
