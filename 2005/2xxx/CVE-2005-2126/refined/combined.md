How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 1.2.1 to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA 1.2.1 will determine whether this update is required for Windows XP Service Pack 1 and for Windows Server 2003. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
MBSA 1.2.1 does not support detection for this vulnerability on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4. For more information about the programs that MBSA 1.2.1 currently does not detect, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460. However, Microsoft has developed a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) that will help customers determine if the security updates that are provided in this security bulletin are required. For more information, see the "Can I use a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?" question in the FAQ section of this bulletin.

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For download links and more information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). SMS customers should review the "Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?" question in the FAQ section of this bulletin for more information about SMS and EST.

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 2.0 to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA 2.0 will determine whether this update is required. MBSA 2.0 can detect security updates for products that Microsoft Update supports. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.
However, the SMS Extended Security Update Inventory Tool is a version of the EST that SMS customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators. To download this version of the EST, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154). This tool may also be available for SMS customers from the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

The Security Update Inventory Tool can be used by SMS for detecting security updates that are offered by [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130), that are supported by [Software Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133), and other security updates that are supported by MBSA 1.2.1.

## Vulnerability Details

#### FTP Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2126:

A tampering vulnerability exists in the Windows FTP client. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify the intended destination location for a file transfer, when a client has manually chosen to transfer a file by using FTP. This vulnerability could allow the attacker to write the file to any file system that is located on an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for FTP Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2126:

* If an attacker successfully persuades users to visit an FTP server hosting files with specially-crafted file names, the attacker would have no way of forcing files to be transferred. User interaction is required before the file can be transferred to the affected system.
* If the malicious FTP transfer tries to overwrite an existing file on the affected system, the user receives an âOverwrite Fileâ warning message. The file is saved only if the user selects to allow it to save when they receive the warning message.

#### Workarounds for FTP Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2126:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Do not download files from un-trusted FTP servers**

  You can mitigate the risk of attack by downloading files only from FTP servers that you trust.

#### FAQ for FTP Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2126:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a tampering vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify the intended destination location for a file transfer when a client has manually chosen to transfer a file by using FTP.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows FTP client does not properly validate file names that are received from FTP servers.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could save files to specific locations on an affected system. These files could allow other attacks. For example, an attacker could save an executable file in the âStartupâ folder. Then, the transferred file would run the next time the user logs on.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Anyone who could persuade a user to visit and transfer files from an FTP server that hosts files that have specially-crafted file names.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by hosting a file on an FTP server that has a specially-crafted file name. The file name must be constructed in such a way that it bypasses the file name validation that the FTP client provides and that it maps to a valid location on the users computer. An attacker must then persuade a user to download this file.

**Can the vulnerability be exploited automatically by visiting an FTP server?**

No. User interaction is required for the file to be transferred and saved by using FTP.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability requires that a user connect to an FTP server and transfer files from the FTP server. Therefore, any systems where FTP transfers occur frequently, such as workstations, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit FTP servers, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way the Windows FTP client validates file names that it receives from FTP servers.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2005-2126

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers. However, examples of proof of concept code had been published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code that has been published publicly that tries to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability for which proof of concept code has been published.

When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition:

| File Name | Version | Date | Time | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Msieftp.dll | 6.0.2800.1724 | 05-Aug-2005 | 17:23 | 230,400 |
| Arpidfix.exe | 5.1.2600.1735 | 24-Aug-2005 | 04:53 | 27,648 |

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

Arpidfix.exe is used by the security update installer to address an issue documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 904630](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/904630). This file is not installed onto the affected system.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition:

## Microsoft Windows FTP client does not properly validate received file names

#### Vulnerability Note VU#415828

Original Release Date: 2005-10-13 | Last Revised: 2005-10-14

---

### Overview

An input validation error in the Microsoft Windows FTP Client may allow a remote attacker to write files to arbitrary locations and may allow the execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| The Microsoft Windows FTP Client does not properly validate the names of received files. If a remote attacker can persuade a user to download a file with a specially crafted name using the Windows FTP Client, that attacker may be able to write that file to an arbitrary location on the users system. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the crafted file name must map to an existing location on the user's system.  Note that this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. For instance, an attacker may be able to leverage this vulnerability to download an arbitrary file to the Startup folder. If the downloaded file is executable, then that file will be executed the next time a user logs in.For more information, including a list of affected software, please see [MS05-044](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-044.mspx). Please note that exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to write files to arbitrary locations on a vulnerable system. If the target location is the Startup folder, then it is possible to cause arbitrary code to be automatically executed the next time the user logs in. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**  Microsoft has addressed this issue in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-044](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-044.mspx) |
| --- |

| **Do not download files from untrusted source****s**  By only downloading files from trusted sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
