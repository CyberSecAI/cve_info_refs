# SpamAssassin 3, Vipul's Razor: Denial of Service vulnerability — GLSA **200506-17**

SpamAssassin and Vipul's Razor are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack
when handling certain malformed messages.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-filter/spamassassin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.4**< **3.0.1** |

| Package | **mail-filter/razor** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.74** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.74** |

### Background

SpamAssassin is an extensible email filter which is used to identify
junk email. Vipul's Razor is a client for a distributed, collaborative
spam detection and filtering network.

### Description

SpamAssassin and Vipul's Razor contain a Denial of Service
vulnerability when handling special misformatted long message headers.

### Impact

By sending a specially crafted message an attacker could cause a Denial
of Service attack against the SpamAssassin/Vipul's Razor server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SpamAssassin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-filter/spamassassin-3.0.4"
```

All Vipul's Razor users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-filter/razor-2.74"
```

One of these issues addresses a bug in the discovery   logic, where a razor-agent that cannot reach the discover server may go into   an infinite loop until discover is available, slowly leaking memory and   eventually crashing the system.  ---    I guess the other is the Content-Type bug similar to SA.

Package        : razor
Vulnerability  : email header parsing error
Problem type   : remote DOS
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CAN-2005-2024

A vulnerability was discovered in the way that Razor parses certain
email headers that could potentially be used to crash the Razor program,
causing a denial of service (DOS).

For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.670-1sarge2.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this issue.

We recommend that you upgrade your razor package.
