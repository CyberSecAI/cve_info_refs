      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-2297",
      "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Sybase EAServer versions 4.2.5 to 5.2. By authenticating to /WebConsole/ and setting the JavaScript parameter in TreeAction.do to a large value, a return address can be overwritten. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the jagsrv.exe process.",
      "root_cause": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking on the JavaScript parameter in TreeAction.do.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Execution of arbitrary code under the security context of the jagsrv.exe process.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access via the web interface."

      "required_capabilities": [
        "Authentication to /WebConsole/"

        "additional_notes": "The default password for the 'jagadmin' user is blank, which can trivialize the authentication requirement."
