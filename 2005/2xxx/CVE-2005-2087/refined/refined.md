Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of COM objects within Internet Explorer when they are instantiated via the `<object>` tag in HTML. Specifically, the JView Profiler COM object (`javaprxy.dll`), not designed to be an ActiveX control, causes memory corruption when instantiated in this manner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Memory Corruption:** Instantiating the `javaprxy.dll` COM object through an HTML `<object>` tag leads to memory corruption.
- **Unintended COM Object Instantiation:** Internet Explorer attempts to instantiate any COM object referenced on a web page, even if they are not designed for browser use. This can lead to unexpected behaviors.
- **Lack of Proper Handling:** The `javaprxy.dll` COM object doesn't respond gracefully to being treated like a non-ActiveX control which results in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the user's privileges.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can cause Internet Explorer to crash.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take full control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Pages:** An attacker can embed the malicious code into a webpage. When a user visits the page, the exploit will be triggered.
- **HTML Email:** The exploit can be delivered via HTML email.
- **Malicious ads:** The vulnerability can be triggered by malicious web content displayed through banner advertisements or other delivery methods

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to host a specially crafted HTML document (webpage or email).
- The attacker has to persuade the user to view the malicious document through a link or some other method.
- No specific user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability (although administrative access on the victim's machine increases the potential impact).

**Additional Notes:**
- Microsoft initially did not confirm the vulnerability and could not reproduce it, but later acknowledged it.
- The vulnerability was addressed by setting the "kill bit" for the affected COM object, preventing it from being instantiated by Internet Explorer.
- Several workarounds were suggested, including disabling ActiveX controls, restricting access to `javaprxy.dll`, and removing the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine.
- The vulnerability affects a range of Windows versions and Internet Explorer versions.
- A proof-of-concept exploit code was publicly available
