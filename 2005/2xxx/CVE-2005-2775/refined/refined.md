Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `extract($REQUEST)` in `php_api.php` at line 77. This function takes an associative array and imports its keys as variables into the current scope. Since the `$REQUEST` array contains both GET and POST parameters, an attacker can manipulate the `$t_path_core` variable by supplying it through the URL (GET request).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Uncontrolled variable import:** The use of `extract($REQUEST)` without proper sanitization or filtering allows an attacker to inject and overwrite arbitrary variables.
- **Path manipulation:** The `$t_path_core` variable, controlled by the attacker, is used to include files via `require_once()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):**  By setting `$t_path_core` to a URL pointing to a malicious script, an attacker can cause the victim's browser to execute arbitrary code when the `require_once` function is called.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the `t_path_core` parameter set to a malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs a location (URL) to host a malicious script that can be injected via the `t_path_core` variable.

**Technical Details**
The specific line of code identified as vulnerable is `extract($REQUEST);` which leads to the ability to modify `$t_path_core` through a GET request. This modified `$t_path_core` is then used in a `require_once()` statement, leading to the inclusion of an arbitrary file from a URL specified by the attacker.

```
require_once( $t_path_core . 'constants_inc.php' );
```
