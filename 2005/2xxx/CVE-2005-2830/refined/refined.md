{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer handles HTTPS proxy server requests that require Basic authentication. Specifically, when a client is configured to use such a proxy, Internet Explorer might send the requested Web address in clear text.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could intercept the clear-text Web addresses being sent to the proxy server, potentially gaining insight into user's browsing activity. This does not lead to direct code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the user and able to analyze network traffic between the client system and the authenticating proxy server.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to eavesdrop on network traffic between the user's machine and the HTTPS proxy server that uses basic authentication."
