- **Root cause of vulnerability**: WebEOC contains multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in different web pages due to a lack of input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can inject and execute arbitrary script (JavaScript, VBScript, HTML) on the vulnerable WebEOC site. They can also potentially retrieve sensitive data, including authentication and medical information.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can inject malicious script into a vulnerable web page on the WebEOC application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject script into the vulnerable WebEOC site, which is possible through web requests.
