- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This results in SQL injection vulnerabilities across multiple applications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weaknesses are SQL injection vulnerabilities present in various parameters across multiple DUWARE products (DUportal PRO, DUamazon Pro, DUpaypal Pro, DUforum, and DUclassmate). The parameters are primarily IDs used in URL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data within the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and the underlying system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vectors are HTTP GET requests with malicious SQL code injected into vulnerable parameters in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges or positions are required besides network access.
