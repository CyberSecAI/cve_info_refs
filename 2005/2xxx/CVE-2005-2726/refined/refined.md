Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2726:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in insecure practices within the Home FTP Server 1.0.7 application. Specifically:
    *   Storing sensitive information (user details and server settings) in clear text files within the application's directory, which is often the user's home directory.
    *   Lack of proper input sanitization or access control checks, enabling directory traversal.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The application stores user information (`ftpmembers.lst`) and FTP server settings (`ftpsettings.lst`) in clear text within the program's directory.
    *   **Directory Traversal:** The application allows users to access files and directories outside of their intended scope on the server, potentially accessing the entire file system.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious user, once authenticated to the FTP server, can access sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and server configuration details.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:**  The directory traversal vulnerability allows a malicious user to view or download any files on the server, regardless of their intended access level, if "Allow download files" is enabled.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attack vector is a user gaining access to the server, then accessing `ftpmembers.lst` and `ftpsettings.lst` files.
    *    **Directory Traversal:**  Attack vector is a user using FTP commands to access directories outside of their home directory.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   For Information Disclosure: The attacker needs to have a valid account on the FTP server.
    *   For Directory Traversal: The attacker needs to have a valid account on the FTP server.

**Additional Information**
*   The provided content includes a link to a proof-of-concept exploit (`HomeFtpServer107b45_MV_poc.py`).
*   The vendor did not provide a fix or a reply about these vulnerabilities.
