- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists when WinAce parses temporary files containing long file entries during compression operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient bounds checking when reading file paths from temporary files, allowing an attacker to write beyond allocated buffer. Specifically, the program does not validate the length of the file entry in the .tmp file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite the return address (EIP), redirecting the flow of execution and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running WinAce.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to craft a malicious .tmp file with an overly long file path and then execute the WinAce application with a specific command-line argument, pointing to that malicious .tmp file using the @ option for a list of files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create a .tmp file and execute the WinAce application with specific command line parameters on the target machine. The attacker needs to have local access to execute commands.
