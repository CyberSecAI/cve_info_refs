Vulnerabilities Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A - Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
A1.- Parameter 'dir' of the script "/view_all_set.php"
is vulnerable to XSS attacks
A2.- XSS in /bug_actiongroup_page.php when deleting a
bug from the /view_all_bug_page.php
B.- Database scanner via variable poisoning in
/core/database_api.php script

Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A - Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A1.- Parameter 'dir' of the script "/view_all_set.php"
is vulnerable to XSS attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameter 'dir' of the /view_all_set.php script is
not correctly sanitize
and is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

The following is a sample url to check the problem:

http://[target]/view_all_set.php?sort=severity&dir="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&type=2

This bug is addressed as #0005959 in the MantisBT bug
database.

A1.- XSS in /bug_actiongroup_page.php when deleting a
bug from the /view_all_bug_page.php
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability was found in the
script /bug_actiongroup_page.php when deleting a bug
from the /view_all_bug_page.php.

To reproduce behaviour follow these steps:

	1.- Report a bug with the following summary:
Test<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
	2.- Enter as administrator and find the bug in
/view_all_bug_page.php script
	3.- Select the checkbox correspondient to this bug
and DELETE in the drop down bellow.
	4.- Press OK.
	5.- In the /bug_actiongroup_page.php you will see the
bug to delete and also a wonderfull
	    javascript alert.

This bug may be considered as non exploitable but it
is exploitable. If you registers only one bug is
possible that the administrator do not selects for
deletion it from the /view_all_bug_page.php but, what
about if you registers 15 messages? The administrator
surely will delete all the bugs by selecting all
the bugs from the /view_all_bug_page.php.

This bug is addressed as #0006002 in the MantisBT bug
database.

B.- Database scanner via variable poisoning in
/core/database_api.php script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the 'register_globals' directive is enabled the
script located at /core/database_api.php
is vulnerable to variable poisoning attacks.

By exploiting the vulnerability an attacker can
connect to databases that are in the web server LAN.

To reproduce the behavior simply navigate to any of
these urls:

http://[target]/core/database_api.php?g_db_type=mysql://invaliduser@localhost:3336
[^]

http://[target]/core/database_api.php?g_db_type=mysql://root@localhost:3336
[^]

http://[target]/core/database_api.php?g_db_type=informix://localhost:8080
[^]

Due to this vulnerability an attacker can write a
database scanner or a network scanner by simply
changing the hostname and port and parsing the
responses.

Examples:
	1.-
http://[target]/core/database_api.php?g_db_type=mysql://root@localhost
[^]
	(Fast response)

	2.-
http://[target]/core/database_api.php?g_db_type=mysql://root@192.168.1.1
[^]
	(No response in about 30 seconds)

	3.-
http://[target]/core/database_api.php?g_db_type=mysql://root@10.x.y.z
[^]
	(Response in about 3 seconds)

A remote user can supply a specially crafted URL to
scan arbitrary ports on arbitrary
hosts using a URL with the following form:

http://[target]/core/database_api.php?g_db_type=<database
type>://<hostname>:<port>

Based on the Response Time and the Response returned
by MantisBT, the remote user can
determine whether the specified port on the specified
host is open or closed. As a consecuence,
a remote user can invoke MantisBT to scan arbitrary
ports on arbitrary hosts.

This bug is addressed as #0005956 in the MantisBT bug
database.

Notes about issue #0005956
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.- This vulnerability doesn't allow an attacker to
run SQL commands against the database.

2.- Not all sites running Mantis Bugtracker are
vulnerables. This only works if the 'register_globals'

directive is On. If you're unsure if your site is
vulnerable you can try the provided exploit,
called 'exploit.py'.

Workarounds:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no known workaround for the #0005959 and
#0006002 issues.

For #0005956 issue you only need to DISABLE the f* PHP
directive 'register_globals'.

Patches:
~~~~~~~~

The followings are patches that solves the #0005956,
#0005959 and #0006002 issues.

The fix:
~~~~~~~~

Issues #0005956 and #0005959 are correcteds in version
1.0.0RC1.
Alternatively, you can use the attacheds non-official
patches.

How to apply the patches:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To apply the patches follow these steps:

	1.- Download (or copy/paste) the patch (or patches)
that you need (i.e.: 0005956.patch).
	2.- Copy the patch to your local '<mantis_dir>/core/'
directory. (i.e.: in my
	    Debian Sarge distribution this is located under
/usr/local/mantis/gui/core).
	3.- Execute the following command:

		$ patch -p0 < 0005956.patch

After applying the patch:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have been applied the patch and you're not sure
if your system is vulnerable
or not, you can run the attached exploit called
(originally...) 'exploit.py' and
follow the instructions.

NOTE: This exploit only probes the issue #0005956.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research).

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : mantis
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2556 CAN-2005-2557

Two security related problems have been discovered in Mantis, a
web-based bug tracking system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-2556

    A remote attacker could insert arbitrary SQL code into SQL
    statements.

CAN-2005-2557

    A remote attacker was able to insert arbitrary HTML code bug
    reports, hence, cross site scripting.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.2-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.2-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your mantis package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Mantis: XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities — GLSA **200509-16**

Mantis is affected by an SQL injection and several cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/mantisbt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.19.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.19.2** |

### Background

Mantis is a web-based bugtracking system written in PHP.

### Description

Mantis fails to properly sanitize untrusted input before using it.
This leads to an SQL injection and several cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities.

### Impact

An attacker could possibly use the SQL injection vulnerability to
access or modify information from the Mantis database. Furthermore the
cross-site scripting issues give an attacker the ability to inject and
execute malicious script code or to steal cookie-based authentication
credentials, potentially compromising the victim's browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mantis users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/mantisbt-0.19.2"
```
