Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Apple Mac OS X's WebKit and Safari handle URLs within PDF files. Specifically, the PDF rendering code in Safari directly calls URLs instead of routing them through the Safari browser's usual security controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Bypass of Security Controls:**  The direct URL calling from within the PDF renderer bypasses security checks implemented by the Safari browser.
*   **Unfiltered URL Handling:** The PDF rendering code doesn't adequately filter or validate URLs, leading to a potential for malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. This could lead to complete system compromise and data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **PDF File Link:** Attackers can embed malicious URLs within PDF files.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must click on the malicious PDF file link.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is remote and does not require physical access to the vulnerable machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** Attackers must be able to host or distribute the malicious PDF file.
*   **User Lure:**  Attackers must trick the victim into clicking on a malicious PDF file link within Safari.
