Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in WordPress 1.5.1.2 and earlier, as described in the provided text:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Description**: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist within the WordPress admin section. These can be exploited through crafted URLs, such as those used for deleting comments.
    *   **Attack Vector**:  Maliciously crafted URLs with javascript code injected into the `comment` parameter of the `post.php` script.
    *   **Impact**: If an attacker obtains an administrator's cookie, they can forge a cookie, access the admin section, and inject malicious PHP code into existing plugins, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Weakness**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the admin panel.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to trick an admin into clicking a malicious link, or obtain an admin's cookie.

2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Description**: The XMLRPC server in WordPress is vulnerable to SQL injection because it receives data from the `$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA` variable, which is not sanitized by the `magic_quotes_gpc()` function or similar code designed to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Root Cause**: Lack of sanitization of data received via `$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA` in the XMLRPC server.
    *   **Attack Vector**: By sending a crafted XML payload to `xmlrpc.php`, an attacker can inject SQL queries. An example is provided that attempts to extract the admin's password hash.
    *   **Impact**:
        *   An attacker can extract sensitive data, such as the admin password hash, without needing to decrypt the hash.
        *   Once the attacker has the admin hash, they can forge a cookie and gain admin access to execute arbitrary PHP code.
    *   **Weakness**: The application uses unsanitized data in SQL queries within the XMLRPC interface.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP POST requests with XML payloads to the WordPress server.

3.  **Forgotten Password Security Issue:**
    *   **Description**: When register_globals is enabled, the `$message` variable in `wp-login.php` is not initialized before being used, allowing an attacker to prepend arbitrary content to the password reset email.
    *   **Root Cause:** Uninitialized variable in the password reset email process when register_globals is on.
    *   **Attack Vector:** If `register_globals` is enabled, attacker can inject content into the password reset email by manipulating the uninitialized `$message` variable
    *   **Impact**: An attacker can modify the password reset email sent to the user.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper variable initialization.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities**: Must be able to manipulate HTTP requests and `register_globals` must be enabled on the server

4. **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Description**: Multiple files disclose the full physical path of the affected server in error messages.
    *   **Attack Vector**: Accessing specific files such as `menu-header.php`, `wp-atom.php`, `wp-rss.php`, and `wp-rss2.php`.
    *   **Impact**: Exposes the full file system path to potential attackers, which can aid in further attacks.
    *   **Weakness:** Information leakage due to improper error handling or verbose output
    *   **Attacker Capabilities**: Ability to make HTTP requests to a WordPress server.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided Perl script `wpcmdexec.pl` demonstrates the SQL injection vulnerability within the XMLRPC interface to extract the admin hash.
*   The script then uses the extracted hash to create a forged cookie and gain admin access, finally creating and exploiting a shell via plugin modification.
* The script uses a technique of injecting php code into an existing plugin that executes a command given in the URL.

**Mitigation:**

*   The advisory states the issue is resolved in WordPress version 1.5.1.3. Users are strongly advised to upgrade.

**Summary:**

The content describes a variety of security flaws in WordPress 1.5.1.2 and earlier. These vulnerabilities, particularly the SQL injection within the XMLRPC interface, allow an attacker to gain administrative access and execute arbitrary commands on the server. The multiple vulnerabilities and attack vectors increase the risk of exploitation.
