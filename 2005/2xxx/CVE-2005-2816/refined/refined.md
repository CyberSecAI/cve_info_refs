Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input (specifically comments) when being logged and later displayed to the administrator. When a user posts a comment containing malicious code (like `<script>` tags or a `<meta>` refresh tag), this code is logged verbatim. When the administrator views the logs, the unsanitized HTML is rendered in the admin's browser, leading to the execution of the malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, as the injected malicious code is executed within the context of the administrator's browser session.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: User-provided input for blog comments is not properly sanitized or encoded before being stored in the log files and then displayed.
- Improper Log Handling: The application directly renders log file content as HTML without any encoding or sanitization when viewed via the admin panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the administrator's browser: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the admin's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, account compromise, or other malicious activities.
- Denial of Service (DoS): In this example, the attacker can use a meta refresh tag to redirect the administrator away from the log viewer, effectively preventing the admin from accessing logs.
- Information disclosure: The attacker might be able to access sensitive information through the XSS attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through blog comments: An attacker injects malicious code into the Name and/or Comment fields of a blog post.
- The malicious code is executed when the administrator views the logs through the admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to post comments on the blog.
- The attacker needs no special privileges; the malicious code will execute in the browser of any administrator who views the log via the admin panel.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content offers a specific code fix by sanitizing the log output, replacing dangerous HTML tags (`<b>`, `<font>`, `<`, `>`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`) with placeholders before replacing them with the intended characters when outputting the log file content.
- The exploit does not require any additional user interaction beyond an administrator viewing the logs.
