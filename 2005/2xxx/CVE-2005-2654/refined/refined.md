Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in `phpldapadmin`'s `login.php` script. The application fails to properly enforce the `disable_anon_bind` configuration setting. While the setting hides the anonymous login checkbox from the user interface, it does not prevent users from crafting a manual HTTP request that includes the `anonymous_bind` parameter, effectively bypassing the intended restriction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the `anonymous_bind` parameter when submitted via an HTTP request. It relies solely on the absence of the checkbox on the login form, rather than enforcing the configuration setting on the backend.
*   **Insecure Default Behavior:** Even if `disable_anon_bind` is set to `true` in the configuration, anonymous login is not truly blocked. The application relies on hiding the form option to prevent it, instead of actually blocking the action server-side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can bypass the intended restriction of disabling anonymous login and gain unauthorized access to the LDAP server, potentially reading or modifying sensitive data depending on configured permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves crafting an HTTP request to the login page that includes the `anonymous_bind` parameter with a checked value, even if the user interface doesn't display the option due to configuration settings.
*   **Form Manipulation:** An attacker can create a custom HTML form similar to the one provided as an example in the bug report to bypass the intended restriction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server running phpldapadmin.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and form submission to craft the malicious request.

**Summary of Content:**

*   The Debian bug report #322423 details the vulnerability, including an example of how to exploit it by manually crafting a login form.
*   The Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 200509-04) confirms the issue, provides a similar description and impact, and references the CVE (CAN-2005-2654).
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 790-1) also confirms the vulnerability and provides information on the patched versions.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `phpldapadmin` version 0.9.6c-5, which properly blocks anonymous logins.
