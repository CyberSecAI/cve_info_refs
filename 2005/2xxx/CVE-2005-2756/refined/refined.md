Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-2756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in Apple QuickTime PictureViewer.
*   The root cause is a lack of proper input validation when handling compressed PICT data. The PictureViewer does not properly validate the size of compressed PICT data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** When PictureViewer decompresses the PICT data, it copies this data to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the decompressed data, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This means an attacker could potentially take control of the user's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted PICT Files:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted PICT file containing malicious compressed data.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by getting the user to open a malicious PICT file.  This can be achieved through various means including malicious websites or email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted PICT file:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PICT file.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the crafted PICT file. This could be achieved through a malicious website, email, instant message, etc.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of QuickTime across both Mac OS X and Windows.
*   Versions 7.0.2 of Quicktime for Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.4 are not vulnerable as the issue was reported prior to their release and they were patched.
*   The vulnerability is considered "Critical" due to the potential for remote code execution.

This information aligns with the description of CVE-2005-2756 as a buffer overflow vulnerability in Apple QuickTime's PictureViewer component that can lead to remote code execution.
