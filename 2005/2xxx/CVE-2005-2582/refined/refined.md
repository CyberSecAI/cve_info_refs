- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure directory permissions (777) on the `/var/log/kav/5.5/kav4unix` log directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The insecure permissions allow any unprivileged local user to modify the contents of the log directory, including replacing the log file with a symbolic link. Additionally, the `kavmonitor` process does not check if the log file is a symlink before writing to it.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By replacing the log file with a symlink to a sensitive file like `/etc/passwd`, an attacker can cause the `kavmonitor` process, which runs as root, to append log data to the target file, effectively creating a new user with root privileges and an empty password.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user with access to the system can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute commands on the vulnerable system.
