How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : py2play
Vulnerability  : design error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2875
Debian Bug     : 326976

Arc Riley discovered that py2play, a peer-to-peer network game engine,
is able to execute arbitrary code received from the p2p game network
it is connected to without any security checks.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain py2play packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.7-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.8-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your py2play package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: py2play security vulnerability
Date: Tue, 6 Sep 2005 15:47:15 -0700
```
Package: py2play
Version: 0.1.7-1

py2play uses Python pickle for sharing Soya objects (or other classes)
over a P2P network.  Pickle objects, when unpickled, contain both data
and code.  A malicious user on a game's P2P net can send custom classes
to fellow players in order to gain access to their systems or execute
malicious commands.

There is no fix to this, this flaw is at py2play's core.  The maintainer
of this package has been aware of this security flaw for some time and
has not only ignored it, but replaced it with a new module called "tofu"
which has the same vulnerability.

At a minimum, users of this Python module need to be aware of this.

Hi!

This is CAN-2005-2875. If you fix this, please mention this number in
the changelog.

However, since this seems to be intrinsically hard to fix (apart from
completely changing the data format), it may be advisable to remove
this package from testing.

Gentoo's security advisory consisted of the removal from the ebuilds.

Thanks,

Martin

Gentoo is not a reference...

I asked the author who made a quick fix disabling network mode. Both
py2play and soya are soon to be uploaded. py2play is still necessary
because it manages the game's main loop and a real dependency removal
would have taken much more time. Cleanups later...

py2play is 1.0.7 on all distribs, so it's ok, 1.0.8 only fixes this
security problem and can be pushed to sarge. I'm asking for a patch for
slune 1.0.7 for sarge.

Stay tuned and please do not yet remove packages.

You are incorrect.  This bug is part of py2play's API, it is unlikely it
will be fixed without a complete rewrite, which is unlikely since it's
developer has abandoned it acknowledging it's faulty design (using TCP)
and security problems.

I do not understand why i'm incorrect out of your explanation...

Py2play must die, but it is NOT currently possible. Slune needs py2play
main loop to work at all, and this fix preserve the loop while
deactivating the network mode, thus removing the security flaw. So, thi
bug _IS_ fixed.

Rewrite happening or not is not my problem, this is upstream's choice ;
Slune, the only program in Debian using py2play, can work nicely without
network mode, and thus everything is fine. Tofu is another problem and
is not packaged yet.

I'll try to get the author to readd a proper network mode when a revised
tofu or another implementation is correctly done, or if i cannot, push
him to take the py2play depends away and remove the package
completly. Fact is we cannot remove a package from a released version
(Sarge) and such a fix handle the problem with a very short amount of
diff lines, making security team happier.

I should add a warning in the py2play description to avoid ppl using
this pkg.

If you still think i'm wrong, what would you do to handle the problem
then ?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Py2Play: Remote execution of arbitrary Python code — GLSA **200509-09**

A design error in Py2Play allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-python/py2play** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.1.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.1.8** |

### Background

Py2Play is a peer-to-peer network game engine written in Python.
Pickling is a Python feature allowing to serialize Python objects into
string representations (called pickles) that can be sent over the
network.

### Description

Arc Riley discovered that Py2Play uses Python pickles to send objects
over a peer-to-peer game network, and that clients accept without
restriction the objects and code sent by peers.

### Impact

A remote attacker participating in a Py2Play-powered game can send
malicious Python pickles, resulting in the execution of arbitrary
Python code on the targeted game client.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All py2play users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-python/py2play-0.1.8"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Arc Riley    2005-08-23 14:43:24 UTC  ``` py2play uses python Pickle to send objects over a p2p game network.  Clients    accept and use objects sent by peers, potentially executing code received from    the network without any security checks to stop it.        Simply put, it's trivial to modify a game client to send an exploit to other    players and gain access to their system as their user.  A local root exploit    could be launched from that point to gain complete access to their system.        py2play was built around the Python Pickle module.  No patch will correct    this without rewritting it from scratch.  It needs to be removed from the  portage tree and any ebuilds which depend on it patched to no longer depend on  it or replace py2play module with a dummy single-user module. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-09-06 18:34:29 UTC  ``` CC'ing kloeri as maintainer ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-09-06 18:41:09 UTC  ``` kloeri as already working on the ebuild ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-09-07 07:42:18 UTC  ``` "No patch will correct this without rewritting it from scratch."  Hmm. So kloeri is rewriting it from scratch ? Or removing the thing ?  Reporter: is this vulnerability public ? If it is restricted, did you communicate with other distributions ? Should/can I forward it to vendor-sec ? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Arc Riley    2005-09-07 09:32:18 UTC  ``` <i>> So kloeri is rewriting it from scratch ? Or removing the thing ?</i>    I hope not, since that is completely unnessesary at this point.  Slune, and  other packages which require py2play, can either be compiled to no longer need  py2play or the package installed by the "py2play" ebuild being nothing more  than a dummy which acts as if it cannot connect.    Honestly, I believe this really should be left to the author of py2play to fix,  and that the correct response from distributions should be to remove it and any  package which depends on it until the problem is solved in the official source.    <i>> Reporter: is this vulnerability public ? If it is restricted, did you  communicate with other distributions ? Should/can I forward it to  vendor-sec ?</i>    We've had this posted on the Soya wiki for some time  [ <http://soya.literati.org/> ] as this is a place likely to be seen by game  maintainers who may use py2play, as the maintainer of py2play (Jiba) wrote an  alternative.      Unfortunetly, either by severe communication failure or testimony to his lack  of interest in users' security, he repeated this mistake in the replacement  (called Tofu) and has since refused to do anything more about it since he views  the risk is "minor" and he believes the easy OO API of py2play/tofu outweighs  the security risks.    Seeing as the author refused to solve this problem, two weeks ago I began  alerting the security teams of different distributions.  Some I haven't found  the correct addresses for, and I'd appreciate it if you forwarded it to them.    I posted it limited to the security team as I didn't want script kiddies to  pounce on this, turning every player of Slune (etc) into a victim.  As I've  demonstrated locally, it's trivial to write a worm which exploits this hole,  and only a bit less trivial to trick victims into launching the game.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-09-11 03:11:07 UTC  ``` Reporter: so I guess we can open the bug and fix/remove the thing ? DerCorny/kloeri: let me know what you're up to... ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-09-12 08:34:16 UTC  ``` Ok, i guess i was a bit too trigger happy with the "kloeri working on ebuild" thing. Seems like we really have to hardmask or remove this package, kloeri might wants to drop a line about what should happen, too? ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Arc Riley    2005-09-12 08:49:39 UTC  ``` I believe that py2play simply needs to be removed/hardmasked/etc.  There isn't  a simple fix, it'd require rewritting py2play as a wrapper around something  more secure and having some knowledge about the underlaying app.    Slune, however, needs to be modified to remove it's multiplayer capability.  If  you'll note, it's multiplayer functionality actually executes received network  data, blowing the py2play security hole 5 magnitudes higher.  At least with  py2play, a potential exploiter has to be a little clever with module loading to  exploit it's hole.    Removing py2play as a dependency from Slune and applying a patch to remove all  instances of it and multiplayer support should allow Slune to still be playable  and keep it's players secure.  Any other package which uses py2play should have  the same thing done for it, I believe.  ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-09-12 08:55:23 UTC  ``` vapier: masking/removing py2play will break some games, you might want to comment :) ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-09-12 10:40:32 UTC  ``` Talked to MrBones and package.masked py2play + slune. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-09-12 11:37:59 UTC  ``` Opening up the bug.

The readme (<http://home.gna.org/oomadness/en/slune/readme.html>) seems to say that they don't use py2play anymore. That's also what I understand from the changelog (<http://home.gna.org/oomadness/en/slune/change.html>) from version 1.0.6 at least.  (sorry if this isn't the right place ... this is the bug that is pointed to in package.mask for slune) ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Arc Riley    2006-05-02 16:16:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 86030](attachment.cgi?id=86030 "py2play-0.1.9.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=86030&action=edit "py2play-0.1.9.ebuild")] py2play-0.1.9.ebuild ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Arc Riley    2006-05-02 16:21:13 UTC  ``` The ebuild I just attached fixes this bug; the author of py2play released a final version with all networking capabilities removed so that Slune can still be played.  He said this was easier than removing py2play from Slune.  My recommendation is to remove the mask and the older ebuilds and run with this until Slune is upgraded to using some other networking library.  The author has stated he will no longer be working on py2play.  I figured this would be the best place to drop this. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-04 09:45:04 UTC  ``` kloeri: your opinion on this ? ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-08 07:30:12 UTC  ``` I'll see if I can bump py2play in the next few days or so. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-11 08:14:20 UTC  ``` Hi,  is the newest version available now ? ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-11 11:19:52 UTC  ``` Bumped in cvs. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-11 12:14:02 UTC  ``` Arches please test and mark stable. ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Samuli Suominen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-13 07:20:22 UTC  ``` py2play (In reply to [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=103524#c21)) > Arches please test and mark stable. >   No hurry to stable it on x86, but I guess it won't harm either. Builds fine here, but no way to test it because:  py2play is only needed by games-action/slune which depends on dev-python/pyopenal and it doesn't build (wrt [bug 102138](show_bug.cgi?id=102138 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-python/pyopenal-0.1.[2-4] compilation failure"))  ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Samuli Suominen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-13 07:54:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=103524#c21)) > Arches please test and mark stable. >   Wanted to mention [bug 124200](show_bug.cgi?id=124200 "RESOLVED FIXED - games-action/slune doesn't run - undefined symbols with soya") also blocks testing with slune, after I solved [bug 102138](show_bug.cgi?id=102138 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-python/pyopenal-0.1.[2-4] compilation failure") (with an version bump). ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-13 14:05:10 UTC  ``` x86 is done... once ppc marks this stable, please also remove the mask on slune/py2play in the tree... ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-13 14:27:36 UTC  ``` Err...
