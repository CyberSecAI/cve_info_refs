Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2005-2177:

**CVE-2005-2177**
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: A programming error in the Net-SNMP library.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The vulnerability exists within the handling of stream-based protocols (e.g., TCP) in the Net-SNMP agent.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, leading to the agent crashing. This is achieved by a malicious SNMP server interacting with a vulnerable agent using a TCP connection. Note that the default configuration uses UDP which is NOT vulnerable.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is remote. A malicious SNMP server sends crafted packets over TCP to a vulnerable Net-SNMP agent, which can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to operate as a malicious SNMP server and be able to connect to a Net-SNMP agent configured to use TCP, which is not the default.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Net-SNMP agents that have opened stream-based protocols such as TCP.
*   Net-SNMP agents using UDP are not vulnerable by default.
*   Patches were released to address the issue in Net-SNMP versions:
    *   5.1.2-6.2 in stable distributions (Debian sarge, Ubuntu 5.04 and 4.10).
    *   5.2.1.2-1 in unstable distributions (Debian sid)
*   The advisory also indicates that while the issue exists in the Net-SNMP library, it is not specific to Debian. This implies the vulnerability impacts other systems using the affected Net-SNMP versions.
*   The Red Hat content also makes reference to this issue, confirming it is in a vulnerable version of Net-SNMP.
