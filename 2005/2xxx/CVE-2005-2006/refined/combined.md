How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Security Advisory: JBOSS 3.2.2-3.2.7 / 4.0.2 installation path
disclosure / config disclosure / version fingerprinting
Date:  14/06/05
URL: <http://www.illegalaccess.org/java/jboss_path.php>

Problem:
The default installation of JBoss reveals the path of the installation
directory and
allows fingerprinting of the server software version by an
unauthenticated HTTP request.
This is due to an information leak bug in the org.jboss.web.WebServer
class.
Unfortunately the JBoss developers did not follow the pattern of
software reuse
and invented their own webserver for RMI code download. The implementation
when confronted with an expected HTTP request such as 'GET %.' reveals
system platform information useful for an attacker. Due to the
classloader architecture
the RMI class download service on port 8083 also allows an attacker to
fingerprint
the version of the JBoss server and with version 4.0.2 to download all
config files such
as the security settings from the /conf directory.

Example 1 (Installation path disclosure): [3.2.x and 4.0.2]
Request:
 >>telnet [jbosshost] 8083
 >>GET %. HTTP/1.0

Reply:
HTTP/1.0 400 C:\Programme\jboss-4.0.2\server\default\conf (Zugriff

Example 2 (Config file download): [4.0.2]

version.tag=
version.name=Zion
version.cvstag=JBoss_4_0_2

# Build identifiers
build.number=200505022023

[and so on]

Severity:
Risk of information leakage.

Workaround:
The JBoss group was contacted on 6/12/05 and reacted with the suggestion
to completely disable the
download of server classes. But this brutal fix severely damages the
functionality and usefulness
of the application server :-( . It seems that they do not consider this
to be a bug that needs
a fix. I leave this uncommented... but anyway the following XML snippets
demonstrates their fix...

<mbean code="org.jboss.web.WebService"
    name="jboss:service=WebService">
    <attribute name="Port">8083</attribute>
    <!-- Should resources and non-EJB classes be downloadable -->
<!-- old      <attribute name="DownloadServerClasses">true</attribute>  -->
<!-- new -->  <attribute name="DownloadServerClasses">false</attribute>
    <attribute name="Host">${jboss.bind.address}</attribute>
    <attribute name="BindAddress">${jboss.bind.address}</attribute>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
