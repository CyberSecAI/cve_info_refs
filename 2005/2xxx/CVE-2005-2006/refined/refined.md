RELATED: CVE-2005-2006
  
The provided content describes an information disclosure vulnerability in JBoss Application Server versions 3.2.2 to 3.2.7 and 4.0.2.  

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an information leak in the `org.jboss.web.WebServer` class, which handles RMI code downloads. This class, when confronted with specific HTTP requests, reveals sensitive system information due to the classloader architecture and how it handles requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The web server implementation for RMI code download reveals the installation path of JBoss, server software version, and configuration files. Specifically, requesting `GET %. HTTP/1.0` discloses the installation path.
- **Configuration File Download:** It allows downloading of configuration files such as `server.policy` and `login-config.xml` through HTTP requests on the RMI class download port.
- **Version Fingerprinting:** The server version can be determined by accessing `org/jboss/version.properties` via HTTP request on the RMI class download port.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Installation Path Disclosure:** An attacker can discover the installation path of the JBoss server, which can aid in planning further attacks.
- **Configuration Disclosure:** An attacker can download sensitive configuration files, which may contain security settings, database credentials, and other sensitive data.
- **Version Fingerprinting:** An attacker can determine the exact version of the JBoss server being used, enabling them to find and exploit known vulnerabilities specific to that version.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker sends a crafted HTTP request via Telnet to the RMI class download service (default port 8083).
- Example requests:
   - `GET %. HTTP/1.0` - Installation path disclosure.
   - `GET %server.policy HTTP/1.0` - Server policy download.
   - `GET %login-config.xml HTTP/1.0` - Login configuration download
   - `GET %org/jboss/version.properties HTTP/1.0` - Version fingerprinting

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the JBoss server's RMI class download port (default 8083).
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
