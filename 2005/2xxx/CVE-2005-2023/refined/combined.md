## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

O.k., I keep following up to myself. Looks like gnupg-1.9.14 has a "brown
paper bag" bug in common/asshelp.c ;-). It's fixed in 1.9.15, SUSE apparently
shipped a broken version of gpg2 in 9.3.

Hi,

I have trouble signing kmail messages with S/MIME on a freshly installed SUSE
9.3 system. The relevant SW versions are:

gpg2-1.9.14-6.2
gpgme-1.0.2-3
pinentry-0.7.1-4

If I try to sign a message with S/MIME I only get a popup telling me "Signing
failed: No pinentry". But pinentry is installed and works fine (I tried it
from the command line) and I also have no trouble signing with OpenPGP/MIME.
With OpenPGP/MIME the pinentry window pops up and asks me for the passphrase
and everything works, but with S/MIME it fails. Following is the bottom of
the debug log:

And this is my gpgsm.conf:

agent-program /usr/bin/gpg-agent
dirmngr-program /usr/bin/dirmngr
disable-crl-checks

###+++--- GPGConf ---+++###
debug-level basic
log-file socket:///home2/kuenne/.gnupg/log-socket
###+++--- GPGConf ---+++### Tue 31 May 2005 02:23:02 PM EDT
# GPGConf edited this configuration file.
# It will disable options before this marked block, but it will
# never change anything below these lines.

The gpg-agent is running and GPG_AGENT_INFO is set correctly. Does anybody
know what's going on here?
