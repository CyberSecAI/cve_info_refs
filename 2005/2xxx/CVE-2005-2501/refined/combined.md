## Apple Mac OS X AppKit vulnerable to buffer overflow via the handling of maliciously crafted rich text files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#435188

Original Release Date: 2005-08-17 | Last Revised: 2005-08-18

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a component of Apple's Mac OS X operating system that handles rich text files.

### Description

| The Cocoa Application Framework (also referred to as the Application Kit, or AppKit) is one of the core Cocoa frameworks supplied with Apple's Mac OS X operating system. It provides functionality and associated application program interfaces (APIs) for applications, including objects for graphical user interfaces (GUIs), event-handling mechanisms, application services, and drawing and image composition facilities.  A buffer overflow exists in the AppKit component designed to handle rich text (.rtf) files. This vulnerability affects applications that use AppKit (such as TextEdit) to open .rtf files. A maliciously crafted .rtf file could be used to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with the ability to supply a maliciously crafted .rtf file could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. The attacker-supplied code would be executed with the privileges of the user opening the malicious file. |
