## Microsoft Plug and Play fails to properly validate user supplied data

#### Vulnerability Note VU#214572

Original Release Date: 2005-10-11 | Last Revised: 2005-10-27

---

### Overview

Microsoft Plug and Play contains a flaw in message buffer handling that may result in local or remote arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| The following is from the Microsoft Plug and Play description:   [*Plug and Play*](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/evaluate/featfunc/plugplay.mspx) *(PnP) allows the operating system to detect new hardware when you install it on a system. For example, when you install a new mouse on your system, PnP allows Windows to detect it, allows Windows to load the needed drivers, and allows Windows to begin using the new mouse.* The Plug and Play service in Microsoft Windows contains a buffer overflow that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.A flaw in the methods used to validate user data in the Windows Plug and Play system may allow a remote, authenticated user to execute arbitrary code on some platforms. Note that on other platforms, the user must be a local, authenticated user and that the flaw cannot be exploited remotely.This vulnerability is similar to the issue reported in [MS05-039](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-039.mspx) ([VU#998653](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/998653)). However, the issue reported in [MS05-047](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-047.mspx) ([VU#214572](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/214572)) is only exploitable by remote, authenticated attackers on Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP1, and is only exploitable by local, authenticated users on Windows XP SP2.Proof of concept exploit code has been made public, with the implication that this is being routinely exploited. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, authenticated user may be able to execute arbitrary code. |

## Vulnerability Details

#### Plug and Play Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2120:

A remote code execution and [local elevation of privilege](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in Plug and Play that could allow an authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Plug and Play Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2120:

* On Windows XP Service Pack 2 an attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely by anonymous users or by users who have standard user accounts. However, the affected component is available remotely to users who have administrative permissions.
* On Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 1 an attacker must have valid logon credentials to try to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely by anonymous users. However, the affected component is available remotely to users who have standard user accounts. In certain configurations, anonymous users could authenticate as the Guest account. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 906574](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/906574).
  **Note** If the security updates that are provided by Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-039](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms05-039) have not been installed on Windows 2000, this issue could be exploited remotely by anonymous users. . If these security updates have been installed, this issue is restricted to authenticated users on Windows 2000. On Windows XP Service Pack 1, this issue is restricted to authenticated users, even without the security updates that are provided by [MS05-039](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms05-039).
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for Plug and Play Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2120:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Note** Other protocols, such as Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX), could be vulnerable to this issue. If you are using vulnerable protocols such as IPX and SPX, you should block the appropriate ports for those protocols. For more information about IPX and SPX, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/reskit/prch_cnn_goue.asp).

**Note** As mentioned in the "Mitigating Factors" section, Windows XP Service Pack 2 is vulnerable to this issue primarily from an attacker who is logged on locally. The following workarounds are designed primarily for earlier operating system versions that are vulnerable to network-based attacks.

* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall:**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected protocol. Blocking them at the firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP Service Pack 1.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP Service Pack 1 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPsec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPsec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

#### FAQ for Plug and Play Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2120:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution and [local privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. On Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 1, an authenticated user could remotely try to exploit this vulnerability. On Windows XP Service Pack 2, only an administrator can remotely access the affected component. Therefore, on Windows XP Service Pack 2, this is strictly a local privilege elevation vulnerability. An anonymous user cannot remotely attempt to exploit this vulnerability on Windows XP Service Pack 2.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process that Plug and Play uses to validate user supplied data.

**What is Plug and Play?**

[Plug and Play](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/evaluate/featfunc/plugplay.mspx) (PnP) allows the operating system to detect new hardware when you install it on a system. For example, when you install a new mouse on your system, PnP allows Windows to detect it, allows Windows to load the needed drivers, and allows Windows to begin using the new mouse.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

On Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 1, an authenticated attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted network message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to execute code. In certain Windows XP configurations, anonymous users could authenticate as the Guest account. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 906574](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/906574). To try to exploit this vulnerability on Windows XP Service Pack 2, an attacker must be able to log on locally to a system and could then run a specially crafted application.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. On Windows 2000, Windows XP Service Pack 1, and Windows XP Service Pack 2 an attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely by anonymous users on Windows 2000, Windows XP Service Pack 1, and Windows XP Service Pack 2.
**Note** If the security updates that are provided by Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-039](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms05-039) have not been installed on Windows 2000, this issue could be exploited remotely by anonymous users. . If these security updates have been installed, this issue is restricted to authenticated users on Windows 2000. On Windows XP Service Pack 1, this issue is restricted to authenticated users, even without the security updates that are provided by [MS05-039](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms05-039).

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Not in most cases. An attacker must be able to log on to the specific system that is targeted for attack. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT professionals can visit the [Security Guidance Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171). On Windows XP Service Pack 2, an attacker must be able to log on to the specific system that is targeted for attack. An anonymous attacker cannot load and run a program remotely by using this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Plug and Play service validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

| Arpidfix.exe | 5.1.2600.2744 | 23-Aug-2005 | 01:01 | 30,720 |  |

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

Arpidfix.exe is used by the security update installer to address an issue documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 904630](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/904630). This file is not installed onto the affected system.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you will be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB905749\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 905749 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows 2000 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

For Windows 2000, this security update requires Service Pack 4 (SP4). For Small Business Server 2000, this security update requires Small Business Server 2000 Service Pack 1a (SP1a) or Small Business Server 2000 running with Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 (SP4).
