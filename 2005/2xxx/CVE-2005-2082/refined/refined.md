- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The im_trbbs.cgi script in imTRBBS (version 1.02 and prior) is vulnerable to remote command execution due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability. The script allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through the `df` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the remote host.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the im_trbbs.cgi script with a malicious value in the `df` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker does not need prior authentication.
