{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE_ID": "CVE-2005-2817",
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Simple Machine Forum (SMF) software allows users to specify an arbitrary URL for their avatar. This URL is then requested by the forum server when displaying pages, leading to information disclosure.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Disclosure vulnerability, where the forum server makes a request to a user-controlled URL when displaying the avatar, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use a malicious script hosted on an external server to log user IP addresses, user agent strings, referer headers, request methods, query strings, accept languages, and request URIs whenever a user visits a page displaying an avatar set to the attacker's URL. This allows for detailed monitoring of user activity, OS and browser information.",
       "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a user setting an avatar URL to a malicious script. When other users view pages that display this avatar, the server makes a request to this URL, triggering the malicious script on the attacker's server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have an account on the forum and the ability to set their avatar URL to an external resource, such as a PHP script that logs the necessary information from the request."
