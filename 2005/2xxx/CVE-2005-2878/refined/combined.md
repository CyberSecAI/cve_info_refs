How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : mailutils
Vulnerability  : format string vulnerability
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2878

A format string vulnerability has been discovered in GNU mailutils

attacker to execute arbitrary code on the IMAP server.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.1-4sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.90-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your mailutils package.

Upgrade Instructions

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

| [Description](#c0)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 09:19:09 UTC  ``` For some reason evolution-mail segfaults.  Specifically, I see evolution  segfault when I click on mail and then the mail-settings option. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 11:06:54 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 11](show_bug.cgi?id=11 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Evolution: mailcomponent crashes when opening mailsettings") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 14:57:53 UTC  ``` test ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 19:28:48 UTC  ``` Ok, have a way of going around the issue (I think).  The problem seems to occur if the mailclient crashes before you close the program the first time the configure-database gets corrupted.   If you directly after Evolution starts for the first time exits cleanly it seems to be working as it should after that. Can this be confirmed somewhere else?   ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 20:45:26 UTC  ``` The shutdown-just-after-starting-the-first-time solution seems to work just fine.  Yayyyy!!!  Changing severity to minor, now that we have a  work-around. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 22:17:53 UTC  ``` I had this problem and had to login to my IMAP server first before opening mail settings.  I'm marking this as fixed since I think it's more of an evolution issue than anything we're doing wrong. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 23:48:45 UTC  ``` Please don't do this. I am assigned to the bug and I haven't marked it as being resolved since I want to look in to the issue. No other distributions has this problem. I wan't to make sure it's not due to our default -O3 CFLAGS. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-07 13:00:08 UTC  ``` Hmmm.  I often get a segfault when trying to print from an email, but it doesn't happen all of the time.  Worse, I don't see any pattern of when it happens. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  JP Sartre    2002-01-19 11:14:09 UTC  ``` Well, I don't know about you guys, but I segfault everytime I try to apply a new filter. Just installed gentoo, so maybe I'm missing something? I can read and delete email fine, just can't add filters. Not sure if this is related or should be a new bug?  JP ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-19 12:19:36 UTC  ``` it's probably not related.  ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-26 11:00:41 UTC  ``` The filter crash is fixed in 1.0.1-r2.  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-07 10:08:37 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 563](show_bug.cgi?id=563 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Evolution Mail Settings Broken") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-08 15:27:11 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 602](show_bug.cgi?id=602 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - evolution segfault") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Nathan Quinlan    2002-05-28 07:55:42 UTC  ``` First time installer of Gentoo, I got the iso image last week and finished  installing everything yesturday.  This Evolution bug still appears to exist.   Emerge installed Evolution 1.0.5 and since I didn't exit after doing the wizard  the evolution-mail process keeps segfaulting. After removing ~/evolution and following the work around it no longer segfaults  but this bug still happens.  Should be re-opened. ``` |  |
