Relevant content from Debian Security Advisory DSA 913-1:
 
- Root cause of vulnerability: An infinite loop in the XPM image processing routine of the gdk-pixbuf library.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: An infinite loop vulnerability is present.
- Impact of exploitation: A denial-of-service (DoS) condition can be caused, which results in an application hang.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted XPM file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening the crafted XPM file with an application using the vulnerable library.
 
Relevant content from Ubuntu Security Notice USN-216-1:
 
- Root cause of vulnerability: An infinite loop in the XPM image loader of the GDK pixbuf library.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The GDK pixbuf library has an infinite loop vulnerability in its XPM image loader.
- Impact of exploitation: Applications trying to open a malicious XPM image will hang, leading to denial-of-service.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted XPM file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a specially crafted XPM image with any Gnome desktop application using the vulnerable GDK pixbuf library.
