Debian Security Advisory DSA 871-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze

Package        : libgda2
Vulnerability  : format string
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2958

Steve Kemp discovered two format string vulnerabilities in libgda2,
the GNOME Data Access library for GNOME2, which may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code in programs that use this library.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.1-2sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libgda2 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# libgda: Format string vulnerabilities ‚Äî GLSA **200511-01**

Two format string vulnerabilities in libgda may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **gnome-extra/libgda** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.2-r1** |

### Background

libgda is the library handling the data abstraction layer in the
Gnome data access architecture (GNOME-DB). It can also be used by
non-GNOME applications to manage data stored in databases or XML files.

### Description

Steve Kemp discovered two format string vulnerabilities in the
gda\_log\_error and gda\_log\_message functions. Some applications may pass
untrusted input to those functions and be vulnerable.

### Impact

An attacker could pass malicious input to an application making
use of the vulnerable libgda functions, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the rights of that application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libgda users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gnome-extra/libgda-1.2.2-r1"
```
### References

* [CVE-2005-2958](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2958)

**Release date**

November 02, 2005

**Latest revision**

November 02, 2005: 01

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
