Based on the provided blog post, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** ATutor

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sufficiently sanitize or encode user-provided data before displaying it in the web page.
*   **Multiple Variables Affected:** The post title "ATutor multiple variable Cross site scripting" implies that multiple input fields or parameters are vulnerable to this flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable parameters. When these scripts are rendered in the victim's browser, the attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The injected script could be used to steal the user's session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect the victim to malicious sites or inject malicious content into the page.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker could change the visual appearance of the page to mislead the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URLs/Links:** An attacker crafts a URL or a link containing malicious scripts embedded in the vulnerable parameters, which are then clicked on by the victim.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker might use social engineering techniques to trick users into clicking the malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link that includes the malicious script.
*   The attacker must entice the victim to visit the crafted link or otherwise trigger the injection of malicious script.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post specifically uses the term "multiple variables" which suggests that the vulnerability might be present in several places within the ATutor application.
*   The post is tagged with "security", "vulnerability" and "XSS", which clearly indicates the nature of the identified flaw.

This information is consistent with the general understanding of XSS vulnerabilities, and while not detailed, is enough to understand the nature of this vulnerability.
