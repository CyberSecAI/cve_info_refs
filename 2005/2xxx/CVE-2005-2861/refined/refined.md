Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability arises from how multiple web vulnerability scanners process HTTP responses, specifically the "Server" header field. If a target host modifies this field to include DHTML code, that code will be executed by the browser when the scanner's HTML report is generated.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Script Injection: The scanners fail to sanitize or properly handle the "Server" header response, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution: The injected script executes within the browser's security context when the report is viewed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Privilege escalation: In the case of Internet Explorer, the injected code executes under the "My Computer" Security Zone, potentially allowing further exploitation.

Attack vectors:
- Malicious Server Response: An attacker modifies the HTTP "Server" header of a target web server to include malicious DHTML code.
- Vulnerable Web Scanners: The vulnerable web vulnerability scanner processes the malicious response and includes it in the generated HTML report.
- Viewing HTML Report: The victim views the generated HTML report in their browser, leading to script execution.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to control the HTTP "Server" header of the target server, which is scanned by a vulnerable web vulnerability scanner
- The victim needs to use one of the vulnerable scanners and view the generated report
