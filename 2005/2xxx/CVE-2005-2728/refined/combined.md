RESOLUTION
HP has made the following patches and software updates available
to resolve the issue.
-> For B.11.04 HP has made the following patch available:
-> PHSS\_34123 Virtualvault 4.7 OWS (Apache 2.x) update
-> PHSS\_34163 Webproxy server 2.1 (Apache 2.x) update
Software updates for the Apache-based Web Server are available
from:
http://h20293.www2.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot\_parser.cgi/cgi/
displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE
HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11 and HP-UX B.11.23 require the Apache-based
Web Server v.2.0.55.00 or subsequent.
Apache Update Procedure
Check for Apache Installation
----------------------------
To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on your
system, use Software Distributor's swlist command. All three
revisions of the product may co-exist on a single system.
For example, the results of the command
swlist -l product | grep -i apache
hpuxwsAPACHE B.2.0.54.00 HP-UX Apache-based Web Server
Stop Apache
-------------
Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary.
Otherwise, the previous binary will continue running, preventing
the new one from starting, although the installation would be
successful. After determining which Apache is installed, stop
Apache with the following commands:
for hpuxwsAPACHE: /opt/hpws/apache[32]/bin/apachectl stop
Download and Install Apache
-----------------------------
Download Apache from Software Depot:
http://h20293.www2.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot\_parser.cgi/cgi/
displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE
Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the value
specified on the installation web page.
Use SD to swinstall the depot.
Installation of this new revision of HP Apache over an existing HP
Apache installation is supported, while installation over a non-HP
Apache is NOT supported.
Removing Apache Installation
----------------------------
If you prefer to remove Apache from your system instead of
installing a newer revision to resolve the security problem, use
both Software Distributor's "swremove" command and also "rm -rf"
the home location as specified in the rc.config.d file "HOME"
variables.
%ls /etc/rc.config.d | grep apache hpapache2conf hpws\_apache[32]conf
MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - Update plus other actions
Install the revision of the product.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c0)  Filip Sneppe    2004-07-07 21:39:29 UTC  ``` This bug may be related to 28175, although I am on a different platform with a slightly different setup, and I can reproduce the problem, so I am  opening a new bugreport for this.  For many months, using different versions of Apache 2.0.x from Debian testing, we have been experiencing what can only be described as serious memory leaks when using mod_proxy and/or mod_rewrite to reverse  proxy backend web servers. I am using MPM prefork.  I have been able to troubleshoot this problem using network captures etc. on  our production machines and I believe I can reproduce this problem on a test system.  To reproduce this, I used an apache 1.3.29 on port 3000 on the localhost used as the backend server. In our live environment, this is on a different machine. Apache 2 listens on port 80 and is used as a reverse proxy for the server on port 3000.  For the Apache1.3, I have /usr/lib/cgi-bin/do-post:  #!/usr/bin/perl print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n"; for ($t=0; $t<400000; ++$t) {         print "o"x99; print "\n" }  Which essentially returns about 40Mb of data.  For the Apache2 config, I have the following virtual host:  <VirtualHost *>         ServerName www.test.local         RewriteEngine On         ProxyRequests On         ProxyPreserveHost Off         RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}      ^www\.test\.local$         RewriteRule ^/(.*)            [http://localhost:3000/$1](http://localhost:3000/%241)     [P,L] </VirtualHost>  Now, the following type of request:  sneppef@xbox:~$ telnet localhost 80 > /tmp/t POST /cgi-bin/do-post HTTP/1.1 Host: www.test.local Range: bytes=20000000-35000000  suddenly bumps the memory use of an apache child process, in this case to about 80Mb on my system, and this doesn't seem to get freed  afterwards.  This is a close as I can simulate this on a test environment at this moment. Things are even more dramatic on our production systems.

Surely if the backend server only returns about 38Mb of data and Apache2 child process shouldn't consume 150Mb :-/  I hope this helps... If you need any other info, let me know, as I have been able to reproduce this every time. I have tagged this as a major issue, since [bug 23567](show_bug.cgi?id=23567 "RESOLVED FIXED - splitting brigades eats memory proportional to number of FLUSH buckets") seems to be considered critical. I hope I am not exagerating, as this is my first bugreport on Apache. Do keep up the excellent work!  Regards ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c1)  Joe Orton    2004-07-08 12:52:19 UTC  ``` Yes, this is a problem with the byterange filter in 2.0, it will buffer the entire response in memory.  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c2)  Filip Sneppe    2004-07-26 14:33:49 UTC  ``` I am just wondering if there is currently *any* workaround for this ? A directive that disables byterange support ? Because, isn't this a serious security issue in itself ? It means any user that can send http requests to an apache proxy can DoS it by sending even a limited number of specially crafted requests that download some large files somewhere... ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c3)  André Malo    2004-07-26 15:40:28 UTC  ``` You can DoS any HTTP server very easy. One could say, that's part of the protocol ;-)  Anyway,  RequestHeader unset Range  or somehting like this should work for you. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c4)  Nick Kew    2004-07-26 16:59:43 UTC  ``` Don't forget  Header unset Accept-Ranges  so the server isn't telling porkies about its capabilities ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c5)  Tyler    2004-09-28 19:52:41 UTC  ``` I appear to be experiencing a similar problem when my users submit files to the server.  I've noticed that a submitted assignment (POST), which has an attached word document, appears to cause one of the apache processes to inflate to between 300 - 750 megabytes in size.  This does not appear to be equal to the size of the attachment. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c6)  Tyler    2004-10-05 19:37:53 UTC  ``` I hunted down the problem, it was an error in a purchased PHP script that loaded the entire contents of our of our db tables into memory (which is now approaching the 800 megabytes threshhold).  However, when the script terminated that memory was not being released by Apache 2.0.51. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c7)  Joe Orton    2005-06-14 22:41:04 UTC  ``` The byterange filter memory consumption issue is now fixed for 2.1.5.  <http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=188797&view=rev> ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c8)  dswhite42    2005-08-18 21:29:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 16102](attachment.cgi?id=16102&action=diff "Byterange patch for Apache 2.0.x") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=16102&action=edit "Byterange patch for Apache 2.0.x") Byterange patch for Apache 2.0.x  I hope Joe won't mind if I post a version of the patch which he modified to work with the Apache 2.0.x branch.  Thanks, Joe! ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c9)  Joe Orton    2005-08-23 10:36:47 UTC  ``` Now merged for 2.0.55.  Thanks for the report. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c10)  Brady Bowen    2005-08-26 13:31:12 UTC  ```  I'm not sure that this has been fixed, I've downloaded the patch and have it applied yet, it still runs amuck.  I checked on my server this morning, and there sat a process in apache holding onto 635MB of data.  Maybe this bug is occuring somewhere else.  I am in no way capable of tracking that down, but I do know it's still occuring.  ``` |  |

# Apache 2.0: Denial of Service vulnerability — GLSA **200508-15**

A bug in Apache may allow a remote attacker to perform a Denial of Service
attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.54-r9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.54-r9**< **2.0** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP Server Project is a featureful, freely-available HTTP
(Web) server.

### Description

Filip Sneppe discovered that Apache improperly handles byterange
requests to CGI scripts.

### Impact

A remote attacker may access vulnerable scripts in a malicious way,
exhausting all RAM and swap space on the server, resulting in a Denial
of Service of the Apache server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.54-r9"
```

# USN-177-1: Apache 2 vulnerabilities

7 September 2005

Apache 2 vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Apache did not honour the "SSLVerifyClient require" directive within a

 block if the surrounding  block contained a

directive "SSLVerifyClient optional". This allowed clients to bypass

client certificate validation on servers with the above configuration.

(CAN-2005-2700)

Filip Sneppe discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the byte

range filter handler. By requesting certain large byte ranges, a

remote attacker could cause memory exhaustion in the server.

(CAN-2005-2728)

The updated libapache-mod-ssl also fixes two older Denial of Service

vulnerabilities: A format string error in the ssl\_log() function which

could be exploited to crash the server (CAN-2004-0700), and a flaw in

the SSL cipher negotiation which could be exploited to terminate a

session (CAN-2004-0885). Please note that Apache 1.3 and

libapache-mod-ssl are not officially supported (they are in the

"universe" component of the Ubuntu archive).

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* apache2-mpm-worker
  -
* apache2-mpm-perchild
  -
* apache2-mpm-prefork
  -
* apache2-mpm-threadpool
  -
* libapache-mod-ssl
  -

##### Ubuntu 4.10

* apache2-mpm-worker
  -
* apache2-mpm-perchild
  -
* apache2-mpm-prefork
  -
* apache2-mpm-threadpool
  -
* libapache-mod-ssl
  -

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CAN-2005-1268 CAN-2005-2088 CAN-2005-2700 CAN-2005-2728

Several problems have been discovered in Apache2, the next generation,
scalable, extendable web server.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-1268

    Marc Stern discovered an off-by-one error in the mod_ssl
    Certificate Revocation List (CRL) verification callback.  When
    Apache is configured to use a CRL this can be used to cause a
    denial of service.

CAN-2005-2088

    A vulnerability has been discovered in the Apache web server.
    When it is acting as an HTTP proxy, it allows remote attackers to
    poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection,
    and conduct cross-site scripting attacks, which causes Apache to
    incorrectly handle and forward the body of the request.

CAN-2005-2700

    A problem has been discovered in mod_ssl, which provides strong
    cryptography (HTTPS support) for Apache that allows remote
    attackers to bypass access restrictions.

CAN-2005-2728

    The byte-range filter in Apache 2.0 allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service via an HTTP header with a large Range
    field.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain Apache2 packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.54-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.54-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c0)  Filip Sneppe    2004-07-07 21:39:29 UTC  ``` This bug may be related to 28175, although I am on a different platform with a slightly different setup, and I can reproduce the problem, so I am  opening a new bugreport for this.  For many months, using different versions of Apache 2.0.x from Debian testing, we have been experiencing what can only be described as serious memory leaks when using mod_proxy and/or mod_rewrite to reverse  proxy backend web servers. I am using MPM prefork.  I have been able to troubleshoot this problem using network captures etc. on  our production machines and I believe I can reproduce this problem on a test system.  To reproduce this, I used an apache 1.3.29 on port 3000 on the localhost used as the backend server. In our live environment, this is on a different machine. Apache 2 listens on port 80 and is used as a reverse proxy for the server on port 3000.  For the Apache1.3, I have /usr/lib/cgi-bin/do-post:  #!/usr/bin/perl print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n"; for ($t=0; $t<400000; ++$t) {         print "o"x99; print "\n" }  Which essentially returns about 40Mb of data.  For the Apache2 config, I have the following virtual host:  <VirtualHost *>         ServerName www.test.local         RewriteEngine On         ProxyRequests On         ProxyPreserveHost Off         RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}      ^www\.test\.local$         RewriteRule ^/(.*)            [http://localhost:3000/$1](http://localhost:3000/%241)     [P,L] </VirtualHost>  Now, the following type of request:  sneppef@xbox:~$ telnet localhost 80 > /tmp/t POST /cgi-bin/do-post HTTP/1.1 Host: www.test.local Range: bytes=20000000-35000000  suddenly bumps the memory use of an apache child process, in this case to about 80Mb on my system, and this doesn't seem to get freed  afterwards.  This is a close as I can simulate this on a test environment at this moment. Things are even more dramatic on our production systems. They have 1Gb of RAM, and the following virtualhost setting:  <VirtualHost *>         ServerName www.xxxxxx.be         RewriteEngine On         ProxyRequests On         ProxyPreserveHost Off         CustomLog /var/log/apache2/www.caffo.be.log "full"         RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}      ^www\.xxxxxx\.be$         RewriteRule ^/(.*)            [http://a.b.c.88/$1](http://a.b.c.88/%241)     [P,L] </VirtualHost>  (I mangled the hostname and IP address in the above!)  combined with the following request (this is straight from a network capture):  POST /xxxxxx/demodownload/download/Converter6_Trial_Setup.exe HTTP/1.0 Via: 1.1 RGOPROXY Content-Length: 45 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.00; Windows 98) Host: www.xxxxxx.be Range: bytes=19092309-38183432 Accept: */* Referer: <http://www.xxxxxx.be/xxxxxx/demodownload/demodownload.downloadpage> Cache-Control: max-stale=0 Connection: Keep-Alive X-BlueCoat-Via: 175D569BDF449936  custid=2813&p_type=CONVDEMO&download=Download  (Again, the xxxxxx are mangled)  Bumps the memory use of an Apache2 process up to about 150Mb. Obviously a  limited number of these kinds of requests render our reverse proxy unusable.  The file in question is 38Mb large. The backend servers returns this (from tcpdump -X):  0x0030   0782 c70e 4854 5450 2f31 2e31 2032 3030        ....HTTP/1.1.200 0x0040   204f 4b0d 0a44 6174 653a 2057 6564 2c20        .OK..Date:.Wed,. 0x0050   3037 204a 756c 2032 3030 3420 3231 3a33        07.Jul.2004.21:3 0x0060   313a 3530 2047 4d54 0d0a 5365 7276 6572        1:50.GMT..Server 0x0070   3a20 4f72 6163 6c65 2048 5454 5020 5365        :.Oracle.HTTP.Se 0x0080   7276 6572 2050 6f77 6572 6564 2062 7920        rver.Powered.by. 0x0090   4170 6163 6865 2f31 2e33 2e31 3220 2857        Apache/1.3.12.(W 0x00a0   696e 3332 2920 4170 6163 6865 4a53 6572        in32).ApacheJSer 0x00b0   762f 312e 3120 6d6f 645f 7373 6c2f 322e        v/1.1.mod_ssl/2. 0x00c0   362e 3420 4f70 656e 5353 4c2f 302e 392e        6.4.OpenSSL/0.9. 0x00d0   3561 206d 6f64 5f70 6572 6c2f 312e 3234        5a.mod_perl/1.24 0x00e0   0d0a 436f 6e74 656e 742d 4c65 6e67 7468        ..Content-Length 0x00f0   3a20 3338 3138 3334 3333 0d0a 436f 6e74        :.38183433..Cont 0x0100   656e 742d 5479 7065 3a20 6170 706c 6963        ent-Type:.applic 0x0110   6174 696f 6e2f 6f63 7465 742d 7374 7265        ation/octet-stre 0x0120   616d 0d0a 0d0a 4d5a 9000 0300 0000 0400        am....MZ........

Surely if the backend server only returns about 38Mb of data and Apache2 child process shouldn't consume 150Mb :-/  I hope this helps... If you need any other info, let me know, as I have been able to reproduce this every time. I have tagged this as a major issue, since [bug 23567](show_bug.cgi?id=23567 "RESOLVED FIXED - splitting brigades eats memory proportional to number of FLUSH buckets") seems to be considered critical. I hope I am not exagerating, as this is my first bugreport on Apache. Do keep up the excellent work!  Regards ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c1)  Joe Orton    2004-07-08 12:52:19 UTC  ``` Yes, this is a problem with the byterange filter in 2.0, it will buffer the entire response in memory.  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c2)  Filip Sneppe    2004-07-26 14:33:49 UTC  ``` I am just wondering if there is currently *any* workaround for this ? A directive that disables byterange support ? Because, isn't this a serious security issue in itself ? It means any user that can send http requests to an apache proxy can DoS it by sending even a limited number of specially crafted requests that download some large files somewhere... ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c3)  André Malo    2004-07-26 15:40:28 UTC  ``` You can DoS any HTTP server very easy. One could say, that's part of the protocol ;-)  Anyway,  RequestHeader unset Range  or somehting like this should work for you. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c4)  Nick Kew    2004-07-26 16:59:43 UTC  ``` Don't forget  Header unset Accept-Ranges  so the server isn't telling porkies about its capabilities ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c5)  Tyler    2004-09-28 19:52:41 UTC  ``` I appear to be experiencing a similar problem when my users submit files to the server.  I've noticed that a submitted assignment (POST), which has an attached word document, appears to cause one of the apache processes to inflate to between 300 - 750 megabytes in size.  This does not appear to be equal to the size of the attachment. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c6)  Tyler    2004-10-05 19:37:53 UTC  ``` I hunted down the problem, it was an error in a purchased PHP script that loaded the entire contents of our of our db tables into memory (which is now approaching the 800 megabytes threshhold).  However, when the script terminated that memory was not being released by Apache 2.0.51. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c7)  Joe Orton    2005-06-14 22:41:04 UTC  ``` The byterange filter memory consumption issue is now fixed for 2.1.5.  <http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=188797&view=rev> ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c8)  dswhite42    2005-08-18 21:29:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 16102](attachment.cgi?id=16102&action=diff "Byterange patch for Apache 2.0.x") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=16102&action=edit "Byterange patch for Apache 2.0.x") Byterange patch for Apache 2.0.x  I hope Joe won't mind if I post a version of the patch which he modified to work with the Apache 2.0.x branch.  Thanks, Joe! ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c9)  Joe Orton    2005-08-23 10:36:47 UTC  ``` Now merged for 2.0.55.  Thanks for the report. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=29962#c10)  Brady Bowen    2005-08-26 13:31:12 UTC  ```  I'm not sure that this has been fixed, I've downloaded the patch and have it applied yet, it still runs amuck.  I checked on my server this morning, and there sat a process in apache holding onto 635MB of data.  Maybe this bug is occuring somewhere else.  I am in no way capable of tracking that down, but I do know it's still occuring.  ``` |  |
