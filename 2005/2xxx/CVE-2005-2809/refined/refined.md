  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-2809",
      "root_cause": "The `silcd` daemon in `silc-server` creates a temporary file in `/tmp` using `fopen` with the \"w+\" mode. This is vulnerable to a symlink attack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure temporary file creation",
        "Symlink vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary files by creating a symlink in `/tmp` with the same name as the temporary file being created by silcd, which could lead to privilege escalation or denial of service.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Creating a symlink in `/tmp` with the name of the temporary file created by `silcd` before `silcd` creates the temporary file."
       ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory. This could be achieved through local access or through another vulnerability that allows for writing to the file system. No network access is required for exploiting this issue"
