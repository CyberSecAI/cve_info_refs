The provided content describes a vulnerability in three different applications from Cj Design: CjTagBoard, CjLinkOut, and CjWeb2Mail. All three applications are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The applications fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to:
*   Steal cookies, potentially gaining access to the victim's session.
*   Deface the website by injecting arbitrary HTML content.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by crafting specific URLs with malicious JavaScript code embedded in the parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and only requires the ability to craft URLs that include malicious scripts, and to get a user to load the crafted URL.

The advisory provides specific vulnerable parameters for each application:
*   **CjTagBoard:** vulnerable parameters are `date`, `time`, `name`, `ip`, `agent`, and `msg`.
*   **CjLinkOut:** vulnerable parameter `123` in `top.php`.
*   **CjWeb2Mail:** vulnerable parameters are `name`, `message`, and `ip` in `thankyou.php` and `emsg` in `web2mail.php`.
