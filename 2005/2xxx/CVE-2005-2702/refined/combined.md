Package        : mozilla-firefox
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CAN-2005-2701 CAN-2005-2702 CAN-2005-2703 CAN-2005-2704
		 CAN-2005-2705 CAN-2005-2706 CAN-2005-2707

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been identified in the
mozilla-firefox web browser.  These vulnerabilities could allow an
attacker to execute code on the victim's machine via specially crafted
network resources.

CAN-2005-2701

	Heap overrun in XBM image processing

CAN-2005-2702

	Denial of service (crash) and possible execution of arbitrary
	code via Unicode sequences with "zero-width non-joiner"
	characters.

CAN-2005-2703

	XMLHttpRequest header spoofing

CAN-2005-2704

	Object spoofing using XBL <implements>

CAN-2005-2705

	JavaScript integer overflow

CAN-2005-2706

	Privilege escalation using about: scheme

CAN-2005-2707

	Chrome window spoofing allowing windows to be created without
	UI components such as a URL bar or status bar that could be
	used to carry out phishing attacks

For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge5

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.7-1

We recommend that you upgrade your mozilla-firefox package.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-58

## Firefox 1.0.7 / Mozilla Suite 1.7.12 Vulnerability Fixes

Announced
September 22, 2005
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.7
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.12

Fixes for multiple vulnerabilities with an overall severity of "critical"
have been released in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.7 and the Mozilla Suite 1.7.12

* [Heap overrun in XBM image processing](#xbm)
  [Critical]
* [Crash on "zero-width non-joiner" sequence](#zero-width)
  [Critical]
* [XMLHttpRequest header spoofing](#xmlhttp)
  [Moderate]
* [Object spoofing using XBL <implements>](#xblspoof)
  [Moderate]
* [JavaScript integer overflow](#js-int)
  [Severe]
* [Privilege escalation using about: scheme](#about)
  [Severe]
* [Chrome window spoofing](#closedwin)
  [Severe]
* [Regression fixes](#regressions)

### Heap overrun in XBM image processing

jackerror reports that an
improperly terminated XBM image ending with space characters
instead of the expected end tag
can lead to a heap buffer overrun.
This appears to be exploitable to install or run
malicious code on the user's machine.

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=300936>

Thunderbird does not support the XBM format and is not affected
by this flaw.

### Crash on "zero-width non-joiner" sequence

Mats Palmgren discovered that a
reported crash on Unicode sequences with "zero-width non-joiner"
characters was due to stack corruption that may be exploitable
to run arbitrary code.

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=296134>

In the default configuration (JavaScript disabled) Thunderbird
will crash, but we do not believe it can be exploited to run the
attacker's code. With JavaScript turned on Thunderbird is
vulnerable to this exploit.

### XMLHttpRequest header spoofing

It was possible to add illegal and malformed headers to
an XMLHttpRequest. This could have been used to exploit
server or proxy flaws from the user's machine, or to fool
a server or proxy into thinking a single request was
a stream of separate requests.
The severity of this vulnerability depends on the value of
servers which might be vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling and
similar attacks, or which share an IP address (virtual hosting)
with the attacker's page.

For users connecting to the web through a proxy this flaw
could be used to bypass the same-origin restriction on
XMLHttpRequests by fooling the proxy into handling a single request
as multiple pipe-lined requests directed at arbitrary hosts.
This could be used, for example, to read files on intranet
servers behind a firewall.

Reported independently by Tim Altman and
Yutaka Oiwa

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=302263>

### Object spoofing using XBL <implements>

moz\_bug\_r\_a4 demonstrated a DOM
object spoofing bug similar to
[MFSA 2005-55](mfsa2005-55.html) using an XBL control
that <implements> an internal interface. The severity depends
on the version of Firefox: investigation so far indicates Firefox 1.0.x
releases don't expose any vulnerable functionality to interfaces
spoofed in this way, but that early Deer Park Alpha 1 versions did.

XBL was changed to no longer allow unprivileged controls from
web content to implement XPCOM interfaces.

### JavaScript integer overflow

Georgi Guninski reported
an integer overflow in the JavaScript engine. We presume
this could be exploited to run arbitrary code under
favorable conditions.

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=303213>

### Privilege escalation using about: scheme

heatsync and
shutdown report two different ways
to bypass the restriction on loading high privileged "chrome"
pages from an unprivileged "about:" page. By itself this is
harmless--once the "about" page's privilege is raised the original
page no longer has access--but should this be combined with
a same-origin violation this could lead to arbitrary code
execution.

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=306261>

### Chrome window spoofing

moz\_bug\_r\_a4 demonstrates a way
to get a blank "chrome" canvas by opening a window from a reference
to a closed window. The resulting window is not privileged, but
the normal browser UI is missing and can be used to construct a spoof
page without any of the safety features of the browser chrome designed
to alert users to phishing sites, such as the address bar and the
status bar.

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=306804>

### Regression fixes

These releases include fixes for the following bugs that were
introduced in previous security releases. These were fixed for
stability reasons, they do not themselves pose any security risk.

* [291178](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=291178)
  InstallTrigger.getVersion gone in Firefox 1.0.3
* [300853](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=300853)
  Caps crash on cleanup [@ DomainPolicy::Drop]
* [301180](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=301180)
  crash if you stop search and hit the search button again (Mozilla 1.7 only)
* [302100](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=302100)
  Firefox 1.0.6 crashes when loading any page if PAC script uses eval

# USN-200-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

11 October 2005

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

A buffer overflow was discovered in the XBM image handler. By tricking

an user into opening a specially crafted XBM image, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

(CAN-2005-2701)

Mats Palmgren discovered a buffer overflow in the Unicode string

parser. Unicode strings that contained "zero-width non-joiner"

characters caused a browser crash, which could possibly even exploited

to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

(CAN-2005-2702)

Georgi Guninski reported an integer overflow in the JavaScript engine.

This could be exploited to run arbitrary code under some conditions.

(CAN-2005-2705)

Peter Zelezny discovered that URLs which are passed to Thunderbird on the

command line are not correctly protected against interpretation by the shell.

If Thunderbird is configured as the default handler for "mailto:" URLs, this

could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking

the user into clicking on a specially crafted URL (for example, in an email or

chat client). (CAN-2005-2968)

This update also fixes some less critical issues which are described

at <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/mfsa2005-58.html>.

(CAN-2005-2703, CAN-2005-2704, CAN-2005-2706, CAN-2005-2707)

The "enigmail" plugin has been updated to work with the new

Thunderbird and Mozilla versions.

Debian Bug     : 327366 329778

Several security-related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and
derived programs.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-2871

    Tom Ferris discovered a bug in the IDN hostname handling of
    Mozilla that allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    and possibly execute arbitrary code via a hostname with dashes.

CAN-2005-2701

    A buffer overflow allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
    code via an XBM image file that ends in a large number of spaces
    instead of the expected end tag.

CAN-2005-2702

    Mats Palmgren discovered a buffer overflow in the Unicode string
    parser that allowas a specially crafted unicode sequences to
    overflow a buffer and cause arbitrary code to be executed.

CAN-2005-2703

    Remote attackers could spoof HTTP headers of XML HTTP requests
    via XMLHttpRequest and possibly use the client to exploit
    vulnerabilities in servers or proxies.

CAN-2005-2704

    Remote attackers could spoof DOM objects via an XBL control that
    implements an internal XPCOM interface.

CAN-2005-2705

    Georgi Guninski discovered an integer overflow in the JavaScript
    engine that might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
    code.

CAN-2005-2706

    Remote attackers could execute Javascript code with chrome
    privileges via an about: page such as about:mozilla.

CAN-2005-2707

    Remote attackers could spawn windows without user interface
    components such as the address and status bar that could be used
    to conduct spoofing or phishing attacks.

CAN-2005-2968

    Peter Zelezny discovered that shell metacharacters are not
    properly escaped when they are passed to a shell script and allow
    the execution of arbitrary commands, e.g. when a malicious URL is
    automatically copied from another program into Mozilla as default
    browser.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.8-1sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.12-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mozilla package.

Debian Bug     : 327366 329778

Several security-related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and
derived programs.  Some of the following problems don't exactly apply
to Mozilla Thunderbird, even though the code is present.  In order to
keep the codebase in sync with upstream it has been altered
nevertheless.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-2871

    Tom Ferris discovered a bug in the IDN hostname handling of
    Mozilla that allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    and possibly execute arbitrary code via a hostname with dashes.

CAN-2005-2701

    A buffer overflow allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
    code via an XBM image file that ends in a large number of spaces
    instead of the expected end tag.

CAN-2005-2702

    Mats Palmgren discovered a buffer overflow in the Unicode string
    parser that allowas a specially crafted unicode sequences to
    overflow a buffer and cause arbitrary code to be executed.

CAN-2005-2703

    Remote attackers could spoof HTTP headers of XML HTTP requests
    via XMLHttpRequest and possibly use the client to exploit
    vulnerabilities in servers or proxies.

CAN-2005-2704

    Remote attackers could spoof DOM objects via an XBL control that
    implements an internal XPCOM interface.

CAN-2005-2705

    Georgi Guninski discovered an integer overflow in the JavaScript
    engine that might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
    code.

CAN-2005-2706

    Remote attackers could execute Javascript code with chrome
    privileges via an about: page such as about:mozilla.

CAN-2005-2707

    Remote attackers could spawn windows without user interface
    components such as the address and status bar that could be used
    to conduct spoofing or phishing attacks.

CAN-2005-2968

    Peter Zelezny discovered that shell metacharacters are not
    properly escaped when they are passed to a shell script and allow
    the execution of arbitrary commands, e.g. when a malicious URL is
    automatically copied from another program into Mozilla as default
    browser.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2-2.sarge1.0.7.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mozilla-thunderbird package.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
