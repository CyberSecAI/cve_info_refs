```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied parameters in multiple PHP scripts, leading to SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and path disclosure vulnerabilities.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), Path disclosure
  - Impact of exploitation:
    - SQL injection: Could allow an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, modifying data, or even taking control of the database server.
    - XSS: Could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or defacement.
    - Path Disclosure: Exposes the server's internal file system structure, which could aid an attacker in planning further attacks.
  - Attack vectors:
    - SQL Injection: Exploiting vulnerable parameters such as 'sid', 'start', 'id', 'qid', and 'lid' in various PHP scripts.
    - XSS: Injecting malicious scripts via the same vulnerable parameters as SQL injection.
    - Path Disclosure: Accessing specific PHP scripts directly or through specific parameters that inadvertently reveal the server's file paths.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP application. No specific positioning on the network is mentioned as needed.
