Dear Bugtraq Reader

3 months ago (15-april-2005) I informed the Oracle Security Team \
(secalert_us@oracle.com) that I will publish bug details if the bugs are not fixed \
with the next critical patch update (CPU July 2005). I know that Oracle products are \
complex and a good patch quality need some time. That's why I offered Oracle \
additional time if 3 months are not sufficient for fixing the bugs. Oracle never \
asked for more time.

Oracle's behaviour not fixing critical security bugs for a long time (over 650 days) \
is not acceptable for their customers. Oracle put their customers in danger. At least \
one critical vulnerability can be abused from any attacker via internet.

I decided to publish these vulnerabilities because it is possible to mitigate the \
risk of these vulnerabilities by using the workarounds provided in the advisories.

Kind Regards

 Alexander Kornbrust
