Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause lies in the improper handling of user-supplied input within various parameters of the Oracle Reports `rwservlet` component. Specifically, the `debug`, `test`, and `delimiter` parameters are vulnerable. This allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript code. Additionally the `customize` parameter can read arbitrary files and expose their content in error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input that is later reflected in the HTML output.
*   **File Disclosure:** The `customize` parameter allows reading arbitrary files on the server, exposing their content in error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a user's browser when they access the vulnerable Oracle Reports URLs. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **File Disclosure:** An attacker could use this to read configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data stored on the server, which could lead to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors are the vulnerable parameters in the `rwservlet` component of Oracle Reports. Specifically:
    *   `debug` parameter in `showenv`
    *   `test` parameter in `parsequery`
    *   `delimiter` parameter when creating reports.
    *  `customize` parameter for file disclosure.
*   The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the injected JavaScript code or file paths and trick a user into clicking it or using a link embedded in another page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious JavaScript or file paths within the vulnerable parameters.
*   The attacker needs to be able to make a user visit the crafted URL. This could be done by social engineering, sending malicious links via email or other means.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the target system's server URL to craft a valid malicious request.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory indicates that the vulnerability was initially reported to Oracle in 2003.
*   Oracle was unresponsive and did not address this vulnerability in the July 2005 Critical Patch Update.
*   The vulnerability is present in Oracle Reports 9.0.2 and potentially other versions as well.
* The advisory suggests that the file disclosure can reveal parts of the file content in error messages.
* The advisory mentions the lack of interest from Oracle to fix this issue.
