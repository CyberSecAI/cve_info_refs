  "CVE-2005-2128": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "An unchecked buffer in DirectShow.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the local user, potentially taking complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by delivering a specially-crafted AVI file to the affected system. This could be done through email by persuading a user to open a malicious file, or by hosting a website with a malicious AVI file and persuading the user to visit the site.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to deliver a specially crafted AVI file to a vulnerable system and convince a user to open it. No special privileges or position is required."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Input validation error in the DirectShow architecture",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow in applications or components that use DirectShow",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user",
      "Attack vectors": "Convincing a user to open a specially crafted media file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker"
