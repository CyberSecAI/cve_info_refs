It is reported to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow issue in the "inflate_table()" function in the "inftrees.c" file. Zlib versions 1.2.2 and earlier are reported to be vulnerable. Ref: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/14162>   (6) HIGH: zlib Compression Library Buffer Overflow Affected: zlib version 1.2.1 and 1.2.2  Description: zlib is a popular compression library that is widely used by programs across all OSs including Linux, Mac OS and Windows. This library contains a buffer overflow that can be triggered by a specially crafted compressed file. An attacker, who can deliver such a crafted file to a program using zlib, may exploit the overflow to execute arbitrary code. For example, a webserver can set "Content-Encoding" HTTP header to gzip, which may lead to an overflow in the browser using the zlib library. The technical details required to craft a malicious file may be obtained by examining the patch.  Status: The vendor will release an official update soon. Many Linux vendors have already provided updates. A list of applications that use zlib can be found at: <http://www.gzip.org/zlib/apps.gz.html>. Many of these applications may require an update from the corresponding vendor.  Council Site Actions: Only a few of the council sites are responding to this item.   One site said their Linux systems will obtain updated packages from the Linux vendor, as the packages become available. Another site will patch their externally accessible servers immediately, and then roll out to internal servers as part of their standard patch cycle. The other sites are still evaluating their risk/exposure level and formulating a remediation response.

CVE ID         : CVE-2005-1849 CVE-2005-2096
Debian Bug     : 318069

Markus Oberhumer discovered a flaw in the way zlib, a library used for
file compression and decompression, handles invalid input. This flaw can
cause programs which use zlib to crash when opening an invalid file.
A further error in the way zlib handles the inflation of certain
compressed files can cause a program which uses zlib to crash when opening
an invalid file.

sash, the stand-alone shell, links statically against zlib, and was
thus affected by these problems.

The old stable distribution (woody) isn't affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7-5sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in

# zlib: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200507-05**

A buffer overflow has been discovered in zlib, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/zlib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.2-r1** |

### Background

zlib is a widely used free and patent unencumbered data
compression library.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered a
buffer overflow in zlib. A bounds checking operation failed to take
invalid data into account, allowing a specifically malformed deflate
data stream to overrun a buffer.

### Impact

An attacker could construct a malformed data stream, embedding it
within network communication or an application file format, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code when decoded by the
application using the zlib library.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All zlib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/zlib-1.2.2-r1"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=162391#c0)  Josh Bressers    2005-07-03 23:20:10 UTC  ``` This is text comes from Mark Adler   The problem was that my previous check for an incomplete code set was  much too liberal.  It allowed the passage of pathological code  descriptions, such as a single code of length 10, like what's in  zlib-testcase.gz (twice).   The deflate spec allows for distance codes  with a single code, but in that case that single code must have length  1.  The patch below now permits incomplete codes only if they consist  of a single code of length 1.   Though the spec only mentions distance  codes in this regard, my patch also allows literal/length codes with a  single code, which would permit a dynamic block that only defines the  end-of-block code.  This should be permitted by the spec, and it won't  crash the code, so I'm letting it through.  The consequence of letting pathological code descriptions through was  that filling out the decoding table with invalid code markers overran  the ENOUGH sized array and overwrote some other stuff in memory  (whatever happened to follow the inflate state).  I thought that I had  prevented that with a check on how much of ENOUGH was being used by the literal/length code, and knowing the maximum that could possibly be  used by a distance code based on an exhaustive search (MAXD).  However  my exhaustive search only included valid distance code sets, and so zlib-testcase.gz overran MAXD, after a similar pathological  literal/length code set had used most of ENOUGH - MAXD.  The patch now  only allows valid code sets through, which are either exactly complete  code sets or code sets that consist of a single code of length 1.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=162391#c1)  Josh Bressers    2005-07-03 23:21:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 116314](attachment.cgi?id=116314&action=diff "Proposed patch from upstream for this issue.")

Debian Security Advisory DSA 797-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                              Michael Stone
September 1st, 2005                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : zsync
Vulnerability  : DOS
Problem-Type   : buffer overflow
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-1849, CAN-2005-2096

zsync, a file transfer program, includes a modified local copy of
the zlib library, and is vulnerable to certain bugs fixed previously
in the zlib package.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the zsync
package.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.3-1.sarge.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.0-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your zsync package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## zlib inflate() routine vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#680620

Original Release Date: 2005-07-07 | Last Revised: 2007-04-05

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow in the zlib compression library may cause any application linked to zlib to improperly and immediately terminate.

### Description

| There is a buffer overflow in the zlib data-compression library caused by a lack of bounds checking in the inflate() routine. If an attacker supplies the inflate()routine with a specially crafted compressed data stream, that attacker may be able to trigger the buffer overflow causing any application linked to zlib, or incorporating zlib code to crash. According to reports, the buffer overflow is caused by a specific input stream and results in a constant value being written into an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability may be exploited locally or remotely depending on the application being attacked.  This vulnerability only affects zlib versions 1.2.1 and 1.2.2. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker be able to exploit this vulnerability by supplying the inflate() routine with specially crafted compressed data. As a result, applications linked to the zlib library may abruptly and abnormally terminate resulting in a denial-of-service condition. According to public reports, this vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, but we have not confirmed this. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply patches from your vendor**  The zlib compression library is freely available and used by many vendors in a wide variety of applications. As a result, any one of these applications may contain this vulnerabilitiy. Users are encouraged to contact their vendors to determine if they are vulnerable and what action to take. |

NetBSD Security Note 20050708-1
===============================

Topic:NetBSD base system not vulnerable to zlib overflow
pkgsrc did provide vulnerable versions

A zlib buffer overflow has been announced.

<http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2005-2096>

The NetBSD Security Officer team was aware of this issue, and would
like to reassure users that the NetBSD base system is not vulnerable.

The bug was introduced in changes to zlib after 1.1.4, the latest
version supplied in the base install of NetBSD.

The vulnerable version, 1.2.2 has been available from pkgsrc.

Users of the audit-packages tool will already have noticed that version
is marked as vulnerable, and the 1.2.2nb1 update addresses the issue.

Other pkgsrc users are encouraged to update devel/zlib to 1.2.2nb1, as
well as to take advantage of the security/audit-packages infrastructure.

Thanks To

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit
<URL:<http://www.freebsd.org/security/>>.

I.   Background

zlib is a compression library used by numerous applications to provide
data compression/decompression routines.

II.  Problem Description

An error in the handling of corrupt compressed data streams can result
in a buffer being overflowed.

III. Impact

By carefully crafting a corrupt compressed data stream, an attacker can
overwrite data structures in a zlib-using application.  This may cause
the application to halt, causing a denial of service; or it may result
in the attacker gaining elevated privileges.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, or to the RELENG\_5\_4 or
RELENG\_5\_3 security branch dated after the correction date.

2) To patch your present system:

The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.3 and 5.4
systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-05:16/zlib.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-05:16/zlib.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/libz/
# make obj && make depend && make && make install

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Qt: Buffer overflow in the included zlib library — GLSA **200509-18**

Qt is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-libs/qt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.3.4-r8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.3.4-r8** |

### Background

Qt is a cross-platform GUI toolkit used by KDE.

### Description

Qt links to a bundled vulnerable version of zlib when emerged with the
zlib USE-flag disabled. This may lead to a buffer overflow.

### Impact

By creating a specially crafted compressed data stream, attackers can
overwrite data structures for applications that use Qt, resulting in a
Denial of Service or potentially arbitrary code execution.

### Workaround

Emerge Qt with the zlib USE-flag enabled.

### Resolution

All Qt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/qt-3.3.4-r8"
```

# USN-151-3: zlib vulnerabilities

29 October 2005

zlib vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

USN-148-1 and USN-151-1 fixed two security flaws in zlib, which could

be exploited to cause Denial of Service attacks or even arbitrary code

execution with malicious data streams.

Since aide is statically linked against the zlib library, it is also

affected by these issues. The updated packagages have been rebuilt

against the fixed zlib.

### Reduce your security exposure
