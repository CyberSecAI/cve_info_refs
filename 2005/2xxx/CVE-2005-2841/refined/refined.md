Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-2841 (Note: While the content doesn't explicitly state this, it aligns with the vulnerability details provided in the CERT advisory which corresponds to this CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy when processing user authentication credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when handling user authentication data during Telnet or FTP sessions using the Authentication Proxy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A remote attacker could exploit the overflow to execute malicious code on the affected device.
- Denial of service: The overflow could also lead to a denial-of-service condition, making the device unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network by sending specially crafted user authentication credentials during an FTP or Telnet session that utilizes the Authentication Proxy feature.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker does not need to authenticate prior to exploiting this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can be located remotely.
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the targeted device running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS and with the authentication proxy enabled for Telnet or FTP sessions.
- Ability to send malicious user authentication credentials: The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted authentication data during Telnet or FTP sessions.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is in the Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy, specifically when handling user credentials for FTP and Telnet sessions.
- Affected Cisco IOS versions include 12.2ZH, 12.2ZL, 12.3, 12.3T, 12.4 and 12.4T based trains.
- A workaround is to disable the Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for Telnet/FTP sessions to prevent exploitation.
- Patches are available from Cisco.
