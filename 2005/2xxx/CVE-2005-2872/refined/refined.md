  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "A 32-bit integer was being used to store jiffies in the ipt_recent module, which caused crashes on 64-bit architectures. Specifically, a time-related calculation was not handled correctly when jiffies rolled over, or if the list of last hits contained empty slots.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect usage of 32-bit data types on a 64-bit architecture.",
         "Improper handling of time-related calculations in the ipt_recent kernel module, specifically with 'jiffies'."
      ],
      "impact": "Kernel panic (crash), denial of service (DoS).",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by engaging with the firewall rules, such as by triggering an SSH brute-force attempt. When an SSH brute-force is detected, the ipt_recent module would be invoked.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be remote and needs to trigger actions that will cause the `ipt_recent` module to be invoked (like an SSH brute-force attack). This is a remote DoS vulnerability."
