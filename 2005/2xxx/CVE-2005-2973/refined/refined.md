{
  "CVE-2005-2973": {
    "Root cause": "The `udp_v6_get_port()` function in the IPv6 code can be forced into an infinite loop.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop vulnerability in the IPv6 networking stack."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (DoS). A local user can cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop, leading to a system crash or unresponsiveness.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local user interaction with the IPv6 networking stack can trigger the infinite loop. Specifically, the vulnerability exists within the `udp_v6_get_port()` function, suggesting manipulation of UDP sockets.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access to an IPv6 enabled system is required to trigger this vulnerability. No specific privileges needed, only the ability to interact with network sockets."
  }
