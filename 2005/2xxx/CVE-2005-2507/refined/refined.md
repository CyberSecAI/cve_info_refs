- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in an unspecified routine used by the Apple Mac OS X Directory Service's authentication process. This buffer can be overwritten via a specially crafted authentication request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apple Directory Service's authentication process.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, network based
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted authentication request to the vulnerable service.
