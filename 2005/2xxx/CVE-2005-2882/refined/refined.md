      "description": "phpCommunityCalendar 4.0.3 (and possibly prior versions) is vulnerable to multiple security issues including SQL injection, login bypass, and cross-site scripting.",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries, and does not sufficiently protect administrative directories. Additionally, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying data in web pages.",

       "impact": "An attacker can bypass login authentication, execute arbitrary SQL queries, gain unauthorized access to administrative functions, and inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could lead to complete compromise of the application, data theft, or defacement.",
