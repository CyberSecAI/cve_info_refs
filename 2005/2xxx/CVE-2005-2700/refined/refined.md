Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-2700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how mod_ssl handles client certificate verification directives within Apache's configuration. Specifically, when `SSLVerifyClient optional` is set in the global virtual host configuration, the `SSLVerifyClient require` directive in a per-location context is not properly enforced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Restriction Bypass:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to bypass the intended client certificate authentication requirements.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The mod\_ssl module fails to enforce the "SSLVerifyClient require" directive in a per-location context when it should be enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker can gain access to restricted web resources without possessing the required client certificate. This can lead to information disclosure or other unauthorized actions depending on the restricted resources.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could potentially leverage a crafted `.htaccess` file to escalate privileges due to an integer overflow vulnerability in the PCRE library bundled with Apache. However, this is related to a different CVE (CAN-2005-2491) and not CVE-2005-2700 directly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack Vector:** By sending a request to a vulnerable web page that is improperly secured using `SSLVerifyClient`, a remote attacker can bypass the certificate authentication.
*  **Local Attack Vector:** A local attacker could potentially exploit Apache's vulnerability, resulting in a local privilege escalation by creating a specially crafted ".htaccess" file. This vector is related to CAN-2005-2491.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.  No specific system privileges are needed on the server.
*   **Local Attacker:** Requires the ability to create a `.htaccess` file on the vulnerable system which, in turn, is able to be processed by the vulnerable Apache software.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `mod_ssl` versions prior to 2.8.24 (for Apache 1.3) and Apache 2 versions prior to 2.0.54-r15.
*   The vulnerability occurs when `SSLVerifyClient optional` is configured in the global virtual host, and `SSLVerifyClient require` is configured in a per-location context.
*   The fix involves upgrading `mod_ssl` or Apache packages to the specified versions.
*   Multiple vendors (Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Mandriva, etc.) provided security advisories and patches.
