Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-2124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- An unchecked buffer exists within the rendering of Windows Metafile (WMF) image formats. This lack of input validation can lead to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the Windows Metafile (WMF) image format rendering code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Complete System Control:** Attackers could gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new user accounts with full privileges.
- **Local Elevation of Privilege or Remote Denial of Service:** The vulnerability could potentially be used to perform local privilege escalation or a remote denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Files:** Persuading a user to open a specially crafted WMF file.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** Hosting a website with a page that exploits the vulnerability through Internet Explorer.
- **HTML Email:** Sending an HTML email with a malicious WMF file that is processed by email clients like Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express.
- **Office Documents:** Embedding a malicious WMF file within an Office document.
- **Local File System/Network Shares:** Persuading a user to preview a folder containing a malicious WMF file on the local system or network shares.
- **Locally Executed Programs:** Running a program that exploits the vulnerability after logging on to the system.
- **Other vectors:** Exploitation through other programs that might pass parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker can be remote and doesn't need authentication to exploit the vulnerability, though some social engineering may be required.
- **Persuasion/Social Engineering:** The attacker needs a way to get the user to open or interact with the specially crafted WMF file (e.g., through malicious links, phishing emails or by enticing them to visit malicious websites).
- **Local System Access:** To locally exploit, the attacker would first have to log onto the system before running the malicious program.

**Additional Notes**

- This vulnerability affects several versions of Windows, including Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003.
- The vulnerability is triggered when software renders the malicious WMF image.
- Microsoft released a patch (MS05-053) to address the issue.
- Workarounds involve reading emails in plain text format and avoiding untrusted sources of WMF files.
- The vulnerability has also been disclosed publicly.
