- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Apple Safari does not perform security checks on hyperlinks contained within rich text (RTF) files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of security checks on hyperlinks within RTF files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands by persuading a user to click on a malicious hyperlink in an RTF file opened with Safari.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious RTF file containing a specially crafted hyperlink and trick a user into opening the file with Safari and clicking on the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious RTF file to the target user and persuade them to open it in Safari and click the malicious link.
