## Apple Safari fails to perform security checks on links in rich text content

#### Vulnerability Note VU#709220

Original Release Date: 2005-08-17 | Last Revised: 2005-08-17

---

### Overview

Apple Safari fails to perform security checks on hyperlinks in rich text content, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Mac OS X includes the [Safari web browser](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/), which can display rich text (RTF) files directly. When Safari opens a rich text file, it will display the contents of the file within the browser window, rather than spawning an external application to view it. Rich text files can contain hyperlinks that the user can click on to navigate to the referenced URI. Safari does not perform security checks on hyperlinks contained within rich text files. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to persuade a user to click on a rich text hyperlink within Safari, leading to remote command execution. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  Please see [Apple Security Update 2005-007](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302163) for details on workarounds, fixes, and updates. |
