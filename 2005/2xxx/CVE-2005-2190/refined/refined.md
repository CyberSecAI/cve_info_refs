Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied input in SQL queries. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or parameterize input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input that is later reflected in the web page, which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   The application directly incorporates user input into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
    *   Vulnerable files include `comersus_optAffiliateRegistrationExec.asp` and `comersus_optReviewReadExec.asp`.
    *   The vulnerable code is located in `/comersus6/includes/databaseFunctions.asp`, line 39.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The application echoes user-supplied input into HTML pages without proper sanitization.
    *   Vulnerable files include `comersus_backoffice_listAssignedPricesToCustomer.asp` and `comersus_backoffice_message.asp`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially:
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, financial information, and other confidential data.
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain control over the database server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can potentially:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens, potentially impersonating users.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Manipulating the `name` and `email` parameters in `comersus_optAffiliateRegistrationExec.asp`.
    *   Manipulating the `idProduct` and `description` parameters in `comersus_optReviewReadExec.asp`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Manipulating the `name` parameter in `comersus_backoffice_listAssignedPricesToCustomer.asp`.
    *  Manipulating the `message` parameter in `comersus_backoffice_message.asp`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No special privileges or access to the server is required.
*   The attacker needs to craft malicious payloads that exploit the SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Additional details:**
* The provided content includes specific URLs that are vulnerable to SQL injection and XSS, as well as the line number where the SQL injection occurs.
* The vendor was contacted, but no reply was received.
