ePing Arbitrary File Creation/Command Execution Vulnerability

OS2A ID: OS2A_1001				Status						Published: 08/04/2005				Updated  : 08/05/2005
	Patch Released

Class: File Creation/Command Execution
Severity: CRITICAL

Overview:
ePing is a ping utility plugin for e107, a PHP-based content management system that \
uses a MySQL backend database. ePing versions 1.02 and prior are vulnerable to a file \
creation vulnerability caused by improper validation of user-supplied input in the \
doping.php script. A remote attacker exploiting this vulnerability could then create \
an arbitrary file in the webserver, pipe multiple system commands in the eping_host \
or the eping_count parameters of the doping.php script, which would be executed \
within the security context of the hosting site.

eTrace, another utility plugin for e107 has similar vulnerabilities.

Description:
e107 portal's eping plugin 1.02 and prior is prone to remote command execution \
vulnerability. This vulnerability exists due to output redirection operators like \
'>', '|', '&' are not being sanitized in eping_host,eping_count parameters in the \
doping.php script.

eping_host has a validate function in functions.php which does not consider the above \
mentioned case.

eping_count has no validation logic. It accepts the above mentioned system meaningful \
characters.

Impact:
A remote user can execute any command using '|' character or create a file with \
malicious executable code with '>' character. Execution of arbitrary command or \
creation of arbitrary files can lead to, Denial of service, Disclosure or  \
modification of system information or Execution of arbitrary code.

Affected Systems:
ePing version 1.02 and prior
Linux (Any), Unix (Any), Windows (Any)
