- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by sending a 'CONFIG' message request to the NDMP server with a timestamp in the `ndmp_header` that is out of range. This leads to an access violation in an executable that is called by the NDMP service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in improper handling of the `time_stamp` field in the `ndmp_header`. Sending an out-of-range value for the timestamp causes the called executable to trigger an access violation, potentially allowing for further exploitation.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The initial impact is an access violation, but the advisory suggests that it may be possible to overwrite data and force the executable to read malicious code, leading to a potentially critical exploit. The main service does not crash, enabling multiple hacking attempts.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is sending a 'CONFIG' message to the NDMP server (TCP port 10000) with an out-of-range timestamp in the `ndmp_header`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the NDMP server on port 10000 and construct an NDMP message with a malformed timestamp.  The advisory mentions that this is not hard to trigger if one knows the NDMP protocol.
