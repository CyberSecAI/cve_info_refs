How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 875-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
October 27th, 2005                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openssl094
Vulnerability  : cryptographic weakness
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-2969

Yutaka Oiwa discovered a vulnerability in the Open Secure Socket Layer
(OpenSSL) library that can allow an attacker to perform active
protocol-version rollback attacks that could lead to the use of the
weaker SSL 2.0 protocol even though both ends support SSL 3.0 or TLS
1.0.

The following matrix explains which version in which distribution has
this problem corrected.

                oldstable (woody)      stable (sarge)     unstable (sid)
openssl          0.9.6c-2.woody.8       0.9.7e-3sarge1      0.9.8-3
openssl 094      0.9.4-6.woody.4             n/a              n/a
openssl 095      0.9.5a-6.woody.6            n/a              n/a
openssl 096           n/a               0.9.6m-1sarge1        n/a
openssl 097           n/a                    n/a            0.9.7g-5

We recommend that you upgrade your libssl packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

OpenSSL Potential SSL 2.0 Rollback Vulnerability(SCOSA-2005.48)

Original Release Date: January 30, 2006

Last Revised: January 31, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-031

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Interim

## 1. Overview:

SCO has issued a security advisory regarding a cross site scripting vulnerability in UnixWare
utilizing openssl. Some Avaya System products are affected by this vulnerability.

A vulnerability has been found in OpenSSL which potentially affects applications that use
the SSL/TLS server implementation provided by OpenSSL. An attacker could potentially perform
a "Man in the Middle" attack using this vulnerability.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2005-2969](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2969) to this issue.

## 2. Avaya System Products with UnixWare running openssl:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intuity Audix | All | Low | See recommended actions below. An update is being considered for a future release. |

## 3. Recommended Actions:

For all system products which use vulnerable versions of UnixWare running openssl, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support [website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 882-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
November 4th, 2005                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openssl095
Vulnerability  : cryptographic weakness
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-2969

Yutaka Oiwa discovered a vulnerability in the Open Secure Socket Layer
(OpenSSL) library that can allow an attacker to perform active
protocol-version rollback attacks that could lead to the use of the
weaker SSL 2.0 protocol even though both ends support SSL 3.0 or TLS
1.0.

The following matrix explains which version in which distribution has
this problem corrected.

We recommend that you upgrade your libssl packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 881-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
November 4th, 2005                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openssl096
Vulnerability  : cryptographic weakness
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-2969

Yutaka Oiwa discovered a vulnerability in the Open Secure Socket Layer
(OpenSSL) library that can allow an attacker to perform active
protocol-version rollback attacks that could lead to the use of the
weaker SSL 2.0 protocol even though both ends support SSL 3.0 or TLS
1.0.

The following matrix explains which version in which distribution has
this problem corrected.

                oldstable (woody)      stable (sarge)     unstable (sid)
openssl          0.9.6c-2.woody.8       0.9.7e-3sarge1      0.9.8-3
openssl 094      0.9.4-6.woody.4             n/a              n/a
openssl 095      0.9.5a-6.woody.6            n/a              n/a
openssl 096           n/a               0.9.6m-1sarge1        n/a
openssl 097           n/a                    n/a            0.9.7g-5

We recommend that you upgrade your libssl packages.
