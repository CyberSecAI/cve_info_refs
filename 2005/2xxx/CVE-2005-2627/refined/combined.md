| [Description](#c0)  Mark    2002-11-05 09:44:14 UTC  ``` ccache was on my system for a while but I decided to unmerge it and remove all references to it. Now when I compile libbonobo-2.0.1, I get a strange ccache error as described in the attachment provided. The issued command is: "CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ emerge -u libbonobo". I couldn't find the solution to this.  Mark ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Mark    2002-11-05 09:45:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 5388](attachment.cgi?id=5388 "Output of the error") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=5388&action=edit "Output of the error")] Output of the error ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-11-05 16:21:56 UTC  ``` How did you remove 'all references to it' ? be a bit more verbose please.  Try remove and emerge ORBit2 again. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mark    2002-11-05 18:18:04 UTC  ``` Hello Foser,  From what I can recall, I removed /usr/bin/ccache, /root/.ccache, I changed the CC-variable from "ccache gcc" to "gcc" and removed a reference in my path (/etc/profile).  grep -r ccache /etc/* yields no results. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Mark    2002-11-05 18:19:27 UTC  ``` As an addition; I just saw the re-emerge of ORBit2 erroring out the same way.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-11-05 18:57:03 UTC  ``` You removed /usr/bin/ccache ? Did you do an 'emerge -C ccache' ? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Mark    2002-11-06 05:10:13 UTC  ``` Yes, but /usr/bin/ccache had to be removed automatically. It wasn't a big deal there were just a bunch of dead symlinks in there. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-11-07 10:23:09 UTC  ``` Hmm seems strange to me.. it should remove _all_ traces, except maybe for some config files (and .ccache files, but those won't hurt). It looks to me as if orbit-idl-2 tries to use ccache for some reason, but i'm not sure  'sh: line 1: ccache: command not found Error: Empty file' refers to that.  You have ccache disabled in //etc/make.globals FEATURES (it shouldn't be in the string)? ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Mark    2002-11-07 17:25:46 UTC  ``` FEATURES in /etc/make.globals contains FEATURES="sandbox". grep -r ccache /usr/portage also doesn't yield usuable results... I'm out of clues certainly :( ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Mark    2002-11-10 05:54:12 UTC  ``` Foser: Got any idea what the issue might be? ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Mark    2002-11-10 06:12:31 UTC  ``` It was solved by doing "emerge libIDL". Maybe it should be an option that whenever ORBit2 is recompiled, it will first remerge libIDL?  Summary: When libIDL is compiled (in my case by ccache gcc) but the compiler is changed (or removed), ORBit2 will not compile anymore. Re-emerging libIDL will solve this case. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-11-10 09:38:39 UTC  ``` Hmm i thought it was something like that, just didn't think of libIDL (got close with ORBit2 ;)).  We cannot force recompilation of deps in an ebuild (and im not sure we should). I think this was a rare condition and its good you figured it out so we can think of it next time ;) Not much we can do about it. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Mark    2002-11-10 17:23:45 UTC  ``` Alright, thanks Foser :) ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : kismet
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2626 CAN-2005-2627
CERT advisory  :
BugTraq ID     :
Debian Bug     :

Several security related problems have been discovered in kismet, a
wireless 802.11b monitoring tool.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-2626

    Insecure handling of unprintable characters in the SSID.

CAN-2005-2627

    Multiple integer underflows could allow remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2005.04.R1-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2005.08.R1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your kismet package.

# Kismet: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200508-10**

Kismet is vulnerable to multiple issues potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-wireless/kismet** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2005.08.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2005.08.1** |

### Background

Kismet is an 802.11 Layer 2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and
intrusion detection system.

### Description

Kismet is vulnerable to a heap overflow when handling pcap captures and
to an integer underflow in the CDP protocol dissector.

### Impact

With a specially crafted packet an attacker could cause Kismet to
execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the program.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Kismet users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/kismet-2005.08.1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
