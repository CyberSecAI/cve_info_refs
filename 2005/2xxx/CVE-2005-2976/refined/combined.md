How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-2975 CVE-2005-2976 CVE-2005-3186
BugTraq ID     : 15428
Debian Bug     : 339431

Several vulnerabilities have been found in gdk-pixbuf, the Gtk+
GdkPixBuf XPM image rendering library.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-2975

    Ludwig Nussel discovered an infinite loop when processing XPM
    images that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via a
    specially crafted XPM file.

CVE-2005-2976

    Ludwig Nussel discovered an integer overflow in the way XPM images
    are processed that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code
    or crash the application via a specially crafted XPM file.

CVE-2005-3186

    "infamous41md" discovered an integer in the XPM processing routine
    that can be used to execute arbitrary code via a traditional heap
    overflow.

The following matrix explains which versions fix these problems:

             old stable (woody)    stable (sarge)   unstable (sid)
gdk-pixbuf     0.17.0-2woody3        0.22.0-8.1       0.22.0-11
gtk+2.0         2.0.2-5woody3         2.6.4-3.1        2.6.10-2

We recommend that you upgrade your gdk-pixbuf packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : gtk+2.0
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-2975 CVE-2005-2976 CVE-2005-3186
BugTraq ID     : 15428
Debian Bug     : 339431

Several vulnerabilities have been found in gtk+2.0, the Gtk+ GdkPixBuf
XPM image rendering library.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-2975

    Ludwig Nussel discovered an infinite loop when processing XPM
    images that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via a
    specially crafted XPM file.

CVE-2005-2976

    Ludwig Nussel discovered an integer overflow in the way XPM images
    are processed that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code
    or crash the application via a specially crafted XPM file.

CVE-2005-3186

    "infamous41md" discovered an integer in the XPM processing routine
    that can be used to execute arbitrary code via a traditional heap
    overflow.

The following matrix explains which versions fix these problems:

             old stable (woody)    stable (sarge)   unstable (sid)
gdk-pixbuf     0.17.0-2woody3        0.22.0-8.1       0.22.0-11
gtk+2.0         2.0.2-5woody3         2.6.4-3.1        2.6.10-2

We recommend that you upgrade your gtk+2.0 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-216-1: GDK vulnerabilities

16 November 2005

GDK vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Two integer overflows have been discovered in the XPM image loader of

the GDK pixbuf library. By tricking an user into opening a specially

crafted XPM image with any Gnome desktop application that uses this

library, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user running the application.

([CVE-2005-2976](/security/CVE-2005-2976), [CVE-2005-3186](/security/CVE-2005-3186))

Additionally, specially crafted XPM images could cause an endless loop

in the image loader, which could be exploited to cause applications

trying to open that image to hang. ([CVE-2005-2975](/security/CVE-2005-2975))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* libgdk-pixbuf2
  -
* gtk2-engines-pixbuf
  -

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* libgdk-pixbuf2
  -
* gtk2-engines-pixbuf
  -

##### Ubuntu 4.10

* libgdk-pixbuf2
  -
* gtk2-engines-pixbuf
  -

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

## References

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# GTK+ 2, GdkPixbuf: Multiple XPM decoding vulnerabilities — GLSA **200511-14**

The GdkPixbuf library, that is also included in GTK+ 2, contains
vulnerabilities that could lead to a Denial of Service or the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-libs/gtk+** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.8.6-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.8.6-r1**revision >= **2.6.10-r1**< **2.0** |

| Package | **media-libs/gdk-pixbuf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.22.0-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.22.0-r5** |

### Background

GTK+ (the GIMP Toolkit) is a toolkit for creating graphical user
interfaces. The GdkPixbuf library provides facilities for image
handling. It is available as a standalone library and also packaged
with GTK+ 2.

### Description

iDEFENSE reported a possible heap overflow in the XPM loader
(CVE-2005-3186). Upon further inspection, Ludwig Nussel discovered two
additional issues in the XPM processing functions : an integer overflow
(CVE-2005-2976) that affects only gdk-pixbuf, and an infinite loop
(CVE-2005-2975).

### Impact

Using a specially crafted XPM image an attacker could cause an
affected application to enter an infinite loop or trigger the
overflows, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GTK+ 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose x11-libs/gtk+
```

All GdkPixbuf users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/gdk-pixbuf-0.22.0-r5"
```
