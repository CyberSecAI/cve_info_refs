[PATCH] raw\_sendmsg DoS (CAN-2005-2492)
Fix unchecked \_\_get\_user that could be tricked into generating a
memory read on an arbitrary address. The result of the read is not
returned directly but you may be able to divine some information about
it, or use the read to cause a crash on some architectures by reading
hardware state. CAN-2005-2492.
Fix from Al Viro, ack from Dave Miller.

[PATCH] 32bit sendmsg() flaw (CAN-2005-2490)
When we copy 32bit ->msg\_control contents to kernel, we walk the same
userland data twice without sanity checks on the second pass.
Second version of this patch: the original broke with 64-bit arches
running 32-bit-compat-mode executables doing sendmsg() syscalls with
unaligned CMSG data areas
Another thing is that we use kmalloc() to allocate and sock\_kfree\_s()
to free afterwards; less serious, but also needs fixing.

[PATCH] Reassembly trim not clearing CHECKSUM\_HW
[IPV4]: Reassembly trim not clearing CHECKSUM\_HW
This was found by inspection while looking for checksum problems
with the skge driver that sets CHECKSUM\_HW. It did not fix the
problem, but it looks like it is needed.
If IP reassembly is trimming an overlapping fragment, it
should reset (or adjust) the hardware checksum flag on the skb.

[PATCH] Fix boundary check in standard multi-block cipher processors
[CRYPTO] Fix boundary check in standard multi-block cipher processors
Fixes Bug 5194 (IPSec related Oops in 2.6.13).
The boundary check in the standard multi-block cipher processors are
broken when nbytes is not a multiple of bsize. In those cases it will
always process an extra block.
This patch corrects the check so that it processes at most nbytes of data.

[PATCH] 2.6.13 breaks libpcap (and tcpdump)
[NET]: 2.6.13 breaks libpcap (and tcpdump)
Patrick McHardy says:
Never mind, I got it, we never fall through to the second switch
statement anymore. I think we could simply break when load\_pointer
returns NULL. The switch statement will fall through to the default
case and return 0 for all cases but 0 > k >= SKF\_AD\_OFF.
Here's a patch to do just that.
I left BPF\_MSH alone because it's really a hack to calculate the IP
header length, which makes no sense when applied to the special data.

[PATCH] x86: pci\_assign\_unassigned\_resources() update
I had some time to think about PCI assign issues in 2.6.13-rc series.
The major problem here is that we call pci\_assign\_unassigned\_resources()
way too early - at subsys\_initcall level. Therefore we give no chances
to ACPI and PnP routines (called at fs\_initcall level) to reserve their
respective resources properly, as the comments in drivers/pnp/system.c
and drivers/acpi/motherboard.c suggest:
/\*\*
\* Reserve motherboard resources after PCI claim BARs,
\* but before PCI assign resources for uninitialized PCI devices
\*/
So I moved the pci\_assign\_unassigned\_resources() call to
pcibios\_assign\_resources() (fs\_initcall), which should hopefully fix a
lot of problems and make PCIBIOS\_MIN\_IO tweaks unnecessary.
Other changes:
- remove resource assignment code from pcibios\_assign\_resources(), since
it duplicates pci\_assign\_unassigned\_resources() functionality and
actually does nothing in 2.6.13;
- modify ROM assignment code as per Ben's suggestion: try to use firmware
settings by default (if PCI\_ASSIGN\_ROMS is not set);
- set CARDBUS\_IO\_SIZE back to 4K as it's a wonderful stress test for
various setups.
Confirmed by Tero Roponen  (who had problems with
the 4kB CardBus IO size previously).

[PATCH] Kconfig: saa7134-dvb must select tda1004x
I wish I had seen this before 2.6.13 was released... I guess this only
goes to show that there haven't been any testers using saa7134-hybrid
dvb/v4l boards that depend on the tda1004x module, during the 2.6.13-rc
series :-(
Please apply this to 2.6.14, and also to 2.6.13.1 -stable. Without this
patch, users will have to EXPLICITLY select tda1004x in Kconfig. This
SHOULD be done automatically when saa7134-dvb is selected. This patch
corrects this problem.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0049

Package names:	   kernel, util-linux, xorg-x11
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2005-09-16
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system: memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.

  util-linux
  The util-linux package contains a large variety of low-level system
  utilities that are necessary for a Linux system to function.  Among
  many features, Util-linux contains the fdisk configuration tool and
  the login program.

  xorg-x11
  X.org X11 is an open source implementation of the X Window System. It
  provides the basic low level functionality which full fledged graphical
  user interfaces (GUIs) such as GNOME and KDE are designed upon.

Problem description:
  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Fix unchecked __get_user that could be tricked into
    generating a memory read on an arbitrary address. The result of the
    read is not returned directly but you may be able to divine some
    information about it, or use the read to cause a crash on some
    architectures by reading hardware state.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CAN-2005-2492 to this issue.

  - SECURITY Fix: Al Viro reported a flaw in sendmsg(). "When we copy
    32bit ->msg_control contents to kernel, we walk the same userland data
    twice without sanity checks on the second pass. Moreover, if original
    looks small enough, we end up copying to on-stack array."

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CAN-2005-2490 to this issue.

  util-linux < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL-2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: unintentional grant of privileges by umount in util-linux
    allows local users with unmount permissions to gain privileges via the
    -r (remount) option, which causes the file system to be remounted with
    just the read-only flag, which effectively clears the nosuid, nodev,
    and other flags. (SA16795)

  xorg-x11 < TSL 3.0 >
  - SECURITY Fix:  Heap overflow in pixmap allocation, An integer overflow
    in pixmap memory allocation potentially allows any xorg-x11 user to
    execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CAN-2005-2495 to this issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=166830#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2005-08-26 10:04:10 UTC  ``` Al Viro discovered in net/ipv[46]/raw.c raw_sendmsg() we have                 if (!inet->hdrincl)                         raw_probe_proto_opt(&fl, msg);                 err = ip_route_output_flow(&rt, &fl, sk, !(msg-.....  So call sendmsg with sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_ICMP, msg->msg_iovlen = 1 and msg->msg_iov[0].iov_base pointing to kernel space (.iov_len > 1).  Then in raw_probe_proto_opt() we have type == msg->msg_iov[0].iov_base code == msg->msg_iov[0].iov_base + 1 when we hit           get_user(fl->fl_icmp_type, type);          __get_user(fl->fl_icmp_code, code);  Note that failure of the first call is ignored and we happily do the second call, an unchecked __get_user() which generates a memory read on the arbitrary user-supplied address.  sendmsg() will fail if iovec points to kernel memory, but it may be possible to trick ip_route_output_flow() into returning an error depending on the value of  fl->fl_icmp_code.  Iff we can do that, the attacker can obtain information about the value read from arbitrary kernel address by looking at the error returned by sendmsg(2).  On some architectures (including x86) a 16 bit read at a user-supplied address could access iomem (no separate mmu context) and therefore mess with hardware state leading to a DoS.  "A local unprivileged user may be able to use this flaw to leak information about the contents of kernel memory, or on some architectures cause a denial of service by manipulating hardware state"   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=166830#c1)  Mark J.

* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Oleg Nesterov discovered a local Denial of Service vulnerability in

the timer handling. When a non group-leader thread called exec() to

execute a different program while an itimer was pending, the timer

expiry would signal the old group leader task, which did not exist any

more. This caused a kernel panic. This vulnerability only affects

Ubuntu 5.04. (CAN-2005-1913)

Al Viro discovered that the sendmsg() function did not sufficiently

validate its input data. By calling sendmsg() and at the same time

modifying the passed message in another thread, he could exploit this

to execute arbitrary commands with kernel privileges. This only

affects the amd64 bit platform. (CAN-2005-2490)

Al Viro discovered a vulnerability in the raw\_sendmsg() function. By

calling this function with specially crafted arguments, a local

attacker could either read kernel memory contents (leading to

information disclosure) or manipulate the hardware state by reading

certain IO ports. This vulnerability only affects Ubuntu 5.04.

(CAN-2005-2492)

Jan Blunck discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the procfs

interface of the SCSI driver. By repeatedly reading

/proc/scsi/sg/devices, a local attacker could eventually exhaust

kernel memory. (CAN-2005-2800)

A flaw was discovered in the handling of extended attributes on ext2

and ext3 file systems. Under certain condidions, this could prevent

the enforcement of Access Control Lists, which eventually could lead

to information disclosure, unauthorized program execution, or

unauthorized data modification. This does not affect the standard Unix

permissions. (CAN-2005-2801)

Chad Walstrom discovered a Denial of Service in the ipt\_recent module,

which can be used in netfilter (Firewall configuration). A remote

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel by sending certain

packets (such as an SSH brute force attack) to a host which uses the

"recent" module. (CAN-2005-2802)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
