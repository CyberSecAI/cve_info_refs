How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug     : 311164 319629 321401 322237

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the
Linux kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilieis and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-0756

    Alexander Nyberg discovered that the ptrace() system call does not
    properly verify addresses on the amd64 architecture which can be
    exploited by a local attacker to crash the kernel.

CVE-2005-0757

    A problem in the offset handling in the xattr file system code for
    ext3 has been discovered that may allow users on 64-bit systems
    that have access to an ext3 filesystem with extended attributes to
    cause the kernel to crash.

CVE-2005-1762

    A vulnerability has been discovered in the ptrace() system call on
    the amd64 architecture that allowas a local attacker to cause the
    kernel to crash.

CVE-2005-1767

    A vulnerability has been discovered in the stack segment fault
    handler that could allow a local attacker to cause stack exception
    that will leed the kernel to crash under certain circumstances.

CVE-2005-1768

    Ilja van Sprundel discovered a race condition in the IA32 (x86)
    compatibility execve() systemcall for amd64 and IA64 that allows
    local attackers to cause the kernel to panic and possibly execute
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2005-2456

    Balazs Scheidler discovered that a local attacker could call
    setsockopt() with an invalid xfrm_user policy message which would
    cause the kernel to write beyond the boundaries of an array and
    crash.

CVE-2005-2458

    Vladimir Volovich discovered a bug in the zlib routines which are
    also present in the Linux kernel and allows remote attackers to
    krash the kernel

CVE-2005-2459

    Another vulnerability has been discovered in the zlib routines
    which are also present in the Linux kernel and allows remote
    attackers to crash the kernel

CVE-2005-2553

    A null pointer dereference in ptrace when tracing a 64-bit
    executable can cause the kernel to crash.

CVE-2005-2801

    Andreas Gruenbacher discovered a bug in the ext2 and ext3 file
    systems.  When data areas are to be shared among two inodes not
    all information were compared for equality, which could expose
    wrong ACLs for files.

CVE-2005-2872

    Chad Walstrom discovered that the ipt_recent kernel module to stop
    SSH bruteforce attacks could cause the kernel to crash on 64-bit
    architectures.

CVE-2005-3275

    An error in the NAT code allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption) by causing two packets for the same
    protocol to be NATed at the same time, which leads to memory
    corruption.

The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:

                                    Debian 3.1 (sarge)
Source                              2.4.27-10sarge1
Alpha architecture                  2.4.27-10sarge1
ARM architecture                    2.4.27-2sarge1
Intel IA-32 architecture            2.4.27-10sarge1
Intel IA-64 architecture            2.4.27-10sarge1
Motorola 680x0 architecture         2.4.27-3sarge1

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Author: Rusty Russell

[PATCH] Module per-cpu alignment cannot always be met
Fwd from Daniel Drake .
The module code assumes noone will ever ask for a per-cpu area more than
SMP\_CACHE\_BYTES aligned. However, as these cases show, gcc asks sometimes
asks for 32-byte alignment for the per-cpu section on a module, and if
CONFIG\_X86\_L1\_CACHE\_SHIFT is 4, we hit that BUG\_ON(). This is obviously an
unusual combination, as there have been few reports, but better to warn
than die.

[PATCH] CAN-2005-2099 Destruction of failed keyring oopses
The attached patch makes sure that a keyring that failed to instantiate
properly is destroyed without oopsing [CAN-2005-2099].
The problem occurs in three stages:
(1) The key allocator initialises the type-specific data to all zeroes. In
the case of a keyring, this will become a link in the keyring name list
when the keyring is instantiated.
(2) If a user (any user) attempts to add a keyring with anything other than
an empty payload, the keyring instantiation function will fail with an
error and won't add the keyring to the name list.
(3) The keyring's destructor then sees that the keyring has a description
(name) and tries to remove the keyring from the name list, which oopses
because the link pointers are both zero.
This bug permits any user to take down a box trivially.

[PATCH] CAN-2005-2098 Error during attempt to join key management session can leave semaphore pinned
The attached patch prevents an error during the key session joining operation
from hanging future joins in the D state [CAN-2005-2098].
The problem is that the error handling path for the KEYCTL\_JOIN\_SESSION\_KEYRING
operation has one error path that doesn't release the session management
semaphore. Further attempts to get the semaphore will then sleep for ever in
the D state.
This can happen in four situations, all involving an attempt to allocate a new
session keyring:
(1) ENOMEM.
(2) The users key quota being reached.
(3) A keyring name that is an empty string.
(4) A keyring name that is too long.
Any user may attempt this operation, and so any user can cause the problem to
occur.

[PATCH] Check input buffer size in zisofs
Add fakey 'deflateBound()' function to the in-kernel zlib routines
It's not the real deflateBound() in newer zlib libraries, partly because
the upcoming usage of it won't have the "stream" available, so we can't
have the same interfaces anyway.
This uses the new deflateBound() thing to sanity-check the input to the
zlib decompressor before we even bother to start reading in the blocks.

This patch fixes the SMP boot timing problem that hit various people and was
introduced in 2.6.12. Please apply to stable.
>From Eric Biederman
sync\_tsc was using smp\_call\_function to ask the boot processor
to report it's tsc value. smp\_call\_function performs an IPI\_send\_allbutself
which is a broadcast ipi. There is a window during processor startup during
which the target cpu has started and before it has initialized it's interrupt
vectors so it can properly process an interrupt. Receveing an interrupt
during that window will triple fault the cpu and do other nasty things.
Why cli does not protect us from that is beyond me.
The simple fix is to match ia64 and provide a smp\_call\_function\_single.
Which avoids the broadcast and is more efficient.
This certainly fixes the problem of getting stuck on boot which was
very easy to trigger on my SMP Hyperthreaded Xeon, and I think
it fixes it for the right reasons.

[PATCH] Fix SRAT for non dual core AMD systems
Patch for 2.6.12-STABLE
This fixes a bug in SRAT handling on AMD systems that was introduced
with the dual core support. It would be disabled on CPUs without dual core.
Just drop the bogus check.

[PATCH] sys\_set\_mempolicy() doesnt check if mode < 0
A kernel BUG() is triggered by a call to set\_mempolicy() with a negative
first argument. This is because the mode is declared as an int, and the
validity check doesnt check < 0 values. Alternatively, mode could be
declared as unsigned int or unsigned long.

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the
Linux kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilieis and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2004-2302

    A race condition in the sysfs filesystem allows local users to
    read kernel memory and cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2005-0756

    Alexander Nyberg discovered that the ptrace() system call does not
    properly verify addresses on the amd64 architecture which can be
    exploited by a local attacker to crash the kernel.

CVE-2005-0757

    A problem in the offset handling in the xattr file system code for
    ext3 has been discovered that may allow users on 64-bit systems
    that have access to an ext3 filesystem with extended attributes to
    cause the kernel to crash.

CVE-2005-1265

    Chris Wright discovered that the mmap() function could create
    illegal memory maps that could be exploited by a local user to
    crash the kernel or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2005-1761

    A vulnerability on the IA-64 architecture can lead local attackers
    to overwrite kernel memory and crash the kernel.

CVE-2005-1762

    A vulnerability has been discovered in the ptrace() system call on
    the amd64 architecture that allowas a local attacker to cause the
    kernel to crash.

CVE-2005-1763

    A buffer overflow in the ptrace system call for 64-bit
    architectures allows local users to write bytes into arbitrary
    kernel memory.

CVE-2005-1765

    Zou Nan Hai has discovered that a local user could cause the
    kernel to hang on the amd64 architecture after invoking syscall()
    with specially crafted arguments.

CVE-2005-1767

    A vulnerability has been discovered in the stack segment fault
    handler that could allow a local attacker to cause stack exception
    that will leed the kernel to crash under certain circumstances.

CVE-2005-2456

    Balazs Scheidler discovered that a local attacker could call
    setsockopt() with an invalid xfrm_user policy message which would
    cause the kernel to write beyond the boundaries of an array and
    crash.

CVE-2005-2458

    Vladimir Volovich discovered a bug in the zlib routines which are
    also present in the Linux kernel and allows remote attackers to
    krash the kernel

CVE-2005-2459

    Another vulnerability has been discovered in the zlib routines
    which are also present in the Linux kernel and allows remote
    attackers to crash the kernel

CVE-2005-2548

    Peter Sandstrom noticed that snmpwalk from a remote host could
    cause a denial of service (kernel oops from null dereference) via
    certain UDP packets that lead to a function call with the wrong
    argument.

CVE-2005-2801

    Andreas Gruenbacher discovered a bug in the ext2 and ext3 file
    systems.  When data areas are to be shared among two inodes not
    all information were compared for equality, which could expose
    wrong ACLs for files.

CVE-2005-2872

    Chad Walstrom discovered that the ipt_recent kernel module on
    64-bit processors such as AMD64 ows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (kernel panic) via certain attacks such as SSH
    brute force.

CVE-2005-3105

    The mprotect code on Itanium IA-64 Montecito processors does not
    properly maintain cache coherency as required by the architecture,
    which allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly
    corrupt data by modifying PTE protections.

CVE-2005-3106

    A race condition in the thread management may allow local users to
    cause a denial of service (deadlock) when threads are sharing
    memory and waiting for a thread that has just performed an exec.

CVE-2005-3107

    When one thread is tracing another thread that shares the same
    memory map a local user could cause a denial of service (deadlock)
    by forcing a core dump when the traced thread is in the
    TASK_TRACED state.

CVE-2005-3108

    A bug in the ioremap() system call has been discovered on the
    amd65 architecture that could allow local users to cause a
    denial of service or an information leak when performing a lookup
    of a non-existant memory page.

CVE-2005-3109

    The HFS and HFS+ (hfsplus) modules allow local attackers to cause
    a denial of service (oops) by using hfsplus to mount a filesystem
    that is not hfsplus.

CVE-2005-3110

    A race ondition in the ebtables netfilter module on an SMB system
    running under high load may allow remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2005-3271

    Roland McGrath discovered exec() does not properly clear
    posix-timers in multi-threaded environments, which results in a
    resource leak and could allow a large number of multiple local
    users to cause a denial of service by using more posix-timers than
    specified by the quota for a single user.

CVE-2005-3272

    The kernel allows remote attackers to poison the bridge forwarding
    table using frames that have already been dropped by filtering,
    which can cause the bridge to forward spoofed packets.

CVE-2005-3273

    The ioctl for the packet radio ROSE protocol does not properly
    verify the arguments when setting a new router, which allows
    attackers to trigger out-of-bounds errors.

CVE-2005-3274

    A race condition in on SMP systems allows local users to cause a
    denial of service (null dereference) by causing a connection timer
    to expire while the connection table is being flushed before the
    appropriate lock is acquired.

CVE-2005-3275

    An error in the NAT code allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption) by causing two packets for the same
    protocol to be NATed at the same time, which leads to memory
    corruption.

CVE-2005-3276

    A missing memory cleanup in the thread handling routines before
    copying data into userspace allows a user process to obtain
    sensitive information.

This update also contains a number of corrections for issues that
turned out to have no security implication afterwards.

The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-31 00:01:57 UTC  ``` A QA test uncovered an input data stream that crashes gzip -d, there's a testcase in the URL field. Upstream informed, but no response yet.  Perhaps huft_build() should be returning non-zero around line 340 of inflate.c? At the moment it causes a NULL deref:  ...     336   if (c[0] == n)                /* null input--all zero length codes */     337   {     338     *t = (struct huft *)NULL;     339     *m = 0;     340     return 0;     341   } ... ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2005-07-02 06:44:09 UTC  ``` the comment just about huft_build() says: /* Given a list of code lengths and a maximum table size, make a set of    tables to decode that set of codes.  Return zero on success, one if    the given code set is incomplete (the tables are still built in this    case), two if the input is invalid (all zero length codes or an    oversubscribed set of lengths), and three if not enough memory. */  the case you're looking at is for 'all zero length codes' which means it should return 2 instead of 0 ... that does fix the crash so i've added gzip-1.3.5-r8 with the fix ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2005-07-02 07:44:16 UTC  ``` forgot to close ... ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  ssjoholm    2005-09-01 09:20:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 67422](attachment.cgi?id=67422 "Gzip file which cannot be decompressed after applying the patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=67422&action=edit "Gzip file which cannot be decompressed after applying the patch")] Gzip file which cannot be decompressed after applying the patch  The patch causes gzip -d to return "gzip: stdin: invalid compressed data--format violated" when decompressing dynamic huffman encoded files which don't have any matches, such as the one I am attaching.  When there are no matches, then the distance huffman tree will have all zero length entries and huft_build() will return 2, even though this is valid according to the gzip spec, RFC1951.	Without the patch the file decompresses correctly.  I am working on finding a fix for both problems now. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
