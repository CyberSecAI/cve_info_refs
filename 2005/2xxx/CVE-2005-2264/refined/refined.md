Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-2264:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing security check in how Firefox handles URLs opened in the sidebar panel. Specifically, the browser failed to properly validate `data:` URLs, allowing them to be injected into any page open in the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation for `data:` URLs when opened in the sidebar, which allows arbitrary code execution.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential:**  The missing security check makes it possible to inject malicious scripts using `data:` URLs. Also, when middle clicking a link in the sidebar, the wrong referrer is sent to the new page. If the new page is `about:config` or a `chrome` page, the referrer is set to the privileged page instead of the sidebar panel itself, which can be used to trigger XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could inject and execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable browser instance.
- **Sensitive Data Theft:**  Exploitation could lead to the theft of cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data by executing malicious JavaScript code.
- **Cross-site Scripting:** Exploiting the wrong referrer sent when middle clicking a link in the sidebar can lead to cross site scripting attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Sidebar Injection:** The primary attack vector is through the Firefox sidebar using the `_search` target to open links in the sidebar.
- **Malicious Data URLs:** Attackers craft malicious `data:` URLs containing JavaScript code to be injected into other pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to create malicious links:** An attacker needs the ability to trick a user into clicking a malicious link that targets the vulnerable sidebar functionality or inject a malicious link via some other vulnerability.

**Additional Details from Bugzilla:**
-  The bug report ([Bug 294074](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=294074)) includes a test case as well as a patch.
-  The bug was fixed in Firefox 1.0.5.
-  The vulnerability also has implications for referer headers when middle-clicking links in the sidebar (see [Bug 226548](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226548)).
