    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-2471",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "The `pstopnm` utility in `netpbm` is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to insecure invocation of Ghostscript.",
       "details": "The `pstopnm` utility, which converts PostScript files to PBM/PGM/PNM formats, calls the Ghostscript interpreter on potentially untrusted PostScript input without the `-dSAFER` option. This allows PostScript code within the input file to perform file I/O and execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running `pstopnm`.",
      "affected_component": "pstopnm utility in netpbm",
      "root_cause": "Insecure invocation of Ghostscript without the `-dSAFER` option when processing untrusted PostScript files.",
      "vulnerability": "Arbitrary code execution via PostScript",
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running the `pstopnm` utility.",
      "attack_vector": "By providing a specially crafted PostScript file to the pstopnm utility.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PostScript file to be processed by pstopnm.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability affects multiple versions of `netpbm` across Debian (oldstable, stable, testing, and sid) and other distributions like Fedora. The fix involves adding the `-dSAFER` option to the Ghostscript command line in `pstopnm` to restrict its capabilities."
