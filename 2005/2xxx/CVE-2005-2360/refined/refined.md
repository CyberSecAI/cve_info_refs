Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2360:

**Verification:**

The provided content from Gentoo, Debian, and Secunia directly mentions CVE-2005-2360 and its associated vulnerabilities in Ethereal. This confirms the content's relevance to the CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The primary root cause is memory allocation errors within the LDAP dissector.
    *   Additionally, multiple other dissectors (AgentX, PER, DOCSIS, RADIUS, Telnet, IS-IS, HTTP, DCERPC, DHCP, SCTP, SMPP, 802.3, H1, WBXML, GIOP, SMB, and BER) are vulnerable to different types of errors.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Memory allocation errors:** Specifically in the LDAP dissector, which can lead to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The SMB dissector had a buffer overflow.
    *   **Null Pointer Dereference:** Occurs in WBXML, GIOP, and SMB dissectors.
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities:**  Present in several dissectors that could allow attackers to write to arbitrary memory locations.
    *   **Infinite Loop/Abortion:**  Caused by incorrect address calculation in the BER dissector.
    *   **General errors** in multiple dissectors leading to denial of service.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most common impact is causing Ethereal to crash or become unresponsive.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Format string vulnerabilities allow for writing to arbitrary memory locations, which could lead to executing malicious code with the privileges of the user running Ethereal (which could be root).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If arbitrary code execution is achieved, it could lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is primarily remote.
    *   Exploitation likely occurs through crafted network packets or traffic that trigger the vulnerabilities in the affected dissectors.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker would need the ability to send or inject network traffic to the machine running Ethereal.
    *   No specific user interaction is required, making this a remote exploit.
    *  The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable dissectors to create the malicious packets.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content gives a detailed breakdown of multiple CVEs fixed in the same Ethereal update.
*   It confirms the vulnerabilities were present in multiple dissectors, not just one.
*   The severity is rated as high and exploitable remotely.
*   The Gentoo advisory specifically mentions that the user running Ethereal could be the root user, which increases the potential damage from exploitation.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 853-1) maps the multiple CAN (CVE) identifiers to the vulnerabilities described.

**Summary:**
CVE-2005-2360 is part of a cluster of vulnerabilities in Ethereal related to memory allocation errors in the LDAP dissector, but also includes other issues across multiple dissectors like buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, format string vulnerabilities, and incorrect address calculations. Exploitation could lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution. Attackers could exploit this remotely by sending crafted network packets.
