**Vulnerabilities:**

The ChurchInfo application is vulnerable to multiple SQL injection and path disclosure vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities arise from improper handling of user-supplied input in various parameters across different PHP pages.

**Specific Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection and Path Disclosure:**
    *   Multiple pages are vulnerable to SQL injection and path disclosure through the `PersonID` parameter: `PersonView.php`, `MemberRoleChange.php`, `PropertyAssign.php`, `WhyCameEditor.php`, `GroupPropsEditor.php`, `Reports/PDFLabel.php`.  `UserDelete.php` first exhibits path disclosure, then an SQL injection vulnerability when clicking yes.
    *   The `DepositSlipID` parameter in `DepositSlipEditor.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection and path disclosure.
    *   The `QueryID` parameter in `QueryView.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection and path disclosure.
    *   Specific `id` parameters within `QueryView.php` are vulnerable to SQL injection via the search box (e.g., `QueryID?id=18`) or by editing the HTML form source (e.g., `QueryID?id=19`).
    *   The `GroupID` parameter in pages like `GroupView.php`, `GroupMemberList.php`, `MemberRoleChange.php`, `GroupDelete.php`, `/Reports/ClassAttendance.php`, and `/Reports/GroupReport.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection and path disclosure.
    *   The `PropertyID` parameter in `PropertyEditor.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection and path disclosure.
    *   The `FamilyID` parameter in pages like `Canvas05Editor.php`, `CanvasEditor.php`, and `FamilyView.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection and path disclosure.
    *   The `PledgeID` parameter in `PledgeDetails.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection and path disclosure.

2.  **Path Disclosure (Divide by Zero):**
    *   Pages `SelectList.php` and `SelectDelete.php` produce a divide-by-zero error, resulting in path disclosure, when an invalid `Number` parameter is given.

3.  **Path Disclosure (Invalid GroupID):**
    *   Pages like `GroupPropsFormRowOps.php`, `/Reports/ClassAttendance.php`, `/Reports/ClassList.php`, `ConfirmLabels.php`, `/DirectoryReport.php`, and `/Reports/NewsLetterLabels.php` produce path disclosure when invalid input is supplied for the `GroupID` parameter.

4.  **Path Disclosure (General):**
    *   Many pages produce `extract()` errors when supplied with bogus input, which leads to path disclosure.
    *   Some pages give path disclosures when directly accessed.

5.  **SQL Errors:**
    *   Some pages, when directly accessed, gave SQL errors about an empty parameter.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input before using it in SQL queries or in file operations, leading to SQL injection and path disclosure.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, or even taking control of the database server.
*   **Path Disclosure:** An attacker can gain information about the server's file system structure, which can be used to plan further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Manipulating URL parameters:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code or invalid values directly into URL parameters like `PersonID`, `Number`, `DepositSlipID`, `QueryID`, `GroupID`, `PropertyID`, `FamilyID`, and `PledgeID`.
*   **HTML form manipulation:** Attackers can edit the HTML source code of forms to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Direct Access:** Attackers can directly access certain pages to trigger path disclosure errors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the server to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**
The report recommends proper sanitization of user input before processing. This would involve using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and proper input validation to prevent path disclosure.
