Package        : ethereal
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2360 CAN-2005-2361 CAN-2005-2363 CAN-2005-2364 CAN-2005-2365 CAN-2005-2366 CAN-2005-2367

Several security problems have been discovered in ethereal, a commonly
used network traffic analyser.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-2360

    Memory allocation errors in the LDAP dissector can cause a denial
    of service.

CAN-2005-2361

    Various errors in the AgentX, PER, DOCSIS, RADIUS, Telnet, IS-IS,
    HTTP, DCERPC, DHCP and SCTP dissectors can cause a denial of
    service.

CAN-2005-2363

    Various errors in the SMPP, 802.3, H1 and DHCP dissectors can
    cause a denial of service.

CAN-2005-2364

    Null pointer dereferences in the WBXML and GIOP dissectors can
    cause a denial of service.

CAN-2005-2365

    A buffer overflow and null pointer dereferences in the SMB
    dissector can cause a denial of service.

CAN-2005-2366

    Wrong address calculation in the BER dissector can cause an
    infinite loop or abortion.

CAN-2005-2367

    Format string vulnerabilities in the several dissectors allow
    remote attackers to write to arbitrary memory locations and thus
    gain privileges.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody13.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.10-2sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.12-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# Ethereal: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200507-27**

Ethereal is vulnerable to numerous vulnerabilities potentially resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code or abnormal termination.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/ethereal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.12** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.12** |

### Background

Ethereal is a feature-rich network protocol analyzer.

### Description

There are numerous vulnerabilities in versions of Ethereal prior
to 0.10.12, including:

* The SMB dissector could overflow a
  buffer or exhaust memory (CAN-2005-2365).
* iDEFENSE discovered
  that several dissectors are vulnerable to format string overflows
  (CAN-2005-2367).
* Additionally multiple potential crashes in
  many dissectors have been fixed, see References for further
  details.

### Impact

An attacker might be able to use these vulnerabilities to crash
Ethereal or execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running Ethereal, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ethereal users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.12"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
