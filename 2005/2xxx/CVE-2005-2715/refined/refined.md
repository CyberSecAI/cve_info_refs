Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `bpjava-msvc` daemon of VERITAS NetBackup Java Administration Console.
- It is caused by the incorrect handling of format string data passed through the `COMMAND_LOGON_TO_MSERVER` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Format string vulnerability. The `bpjava-msvc` daemon does not properly sanitize format string specifiers in the data it processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- This code execution occurs with root or SYSTEM privileges, granting the attacker complete control over the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed on TCP port 13722, which `bpjava-msvc` listens on.
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network connection, and no authentication is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system on port 13722.
- No prior authentication or specialized knowledge beyond exploiting format string vulnerabilities is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects both NetBackup clients and servers.
- Publicly available exploit code exists for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Kevin Finisterre, with exploitation assistance from JohnH.
- Symantec released security updates to address this vulnerability.
