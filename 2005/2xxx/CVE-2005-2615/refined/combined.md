Similarly, flags that would normally be hidden are displayed in italics as well. * On the Manage Styles page, administrators can now easily preview each style before selecting one to edit. * Style configuration fields now default to acceptable values when creating a new style. * When adding/updating/deleting raids, members' first and last raids are finally calculated correctly in all situations [ ]. * If Hide Inactive Members was set to off, inactive members still wouldn't be shown [ ]. * Renamed Membership flags to Membership Ranks to avoid confusion with the Planes of Power flags. * Members with no flag (rank!) were ignored when parsing a log; thanks ryunosuke. * Members added during addraid were set to inactive; thanks ryunosuke. * Fixed a minor security flaw in the CVS versions of the administrative list pages; thanks ryunosuke. * Member flags can now have HTML prefixes and suffixes so you can, for example, color-code members based on their flags. * Fixed a bug where some members would be individually updated for no reason when processing a raid; thanks ryunosuke. * Items on the main menus and administrative menu are not shown to users that don't have permission to access their linked pages. * When editing a raid that occurred between after noon using a 24-hour format, the time would be reset to its 12-hour format (10:00 PM would become 10:00 AM); thanks ryunosuke. * When viewing a member, attendance percentages are only shown for events that still exist in the database. * Added a class distribution breakdown to the viewraid page; thanks ryunosuke. * Users can now log in without the use of cookies [ and ]; thanks ryunosuke.  * 24 bug fixes * 28 new features * 0 removed features * 4 notes    Version 1.1.0 - Mar 22, 2003  * If a log was pasted directly from notepad, any roleplay members wouldn't be found because EverQuest inserts two spaces between the name and the guildtag. Added a check for either 1 or 2 spaces. Thanks Fenicks. * . * Database Size calculation now only applies to EQdkp tables. * Admin Panel menu is now dynamic and has a hook 'admin\_menu' for plugins to use. * Added hook log\_actions to admin/logs.php. * Added hook user\_permissions\_update to admin/manage\_users.php. * Added an attendance by event breakdown on the viewmember page. * Added a filter drop-down to the listmembers page. Thanks Draelon. * Added error-checking to redirect() to make sure the URL exists. * The guildtag option in the Configuration panel has been changed. The field that must match a /who GUILD log is now the second field, 'Guildtags to parse' (see below). * To support guild alliances wanting to use EQdkp and allow greater flexibility when parsing logs, the log parser now supports various options at run-time, including whether or not to include roleplay members, and which guildtag(s) to parse for. * If account validation was set to admin, the administrator wouldn't be able to validate accounts without first logging out. * Checkbox generation for permissions on Configuration and Manage Users is now dynamic to allow easier integration for plugins. * User::check\_auth now stores permission settings for the previous call to itself if $user\_id is set. This lowers the query count on certain pages by as much as 40. * Improved query efficiency in stats.php and summary.php. * Settings menus are now array-driven. * Implemented a new, entirely object-oriented plugin system. Draelon did a ton of work on this, so many thanks to him for contributing to making this work. Aside from being very easy to utilize in plugins, it also vastly improved the efficiency of EQdkp's plugin foundation. * [#705213](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=705213&group_id=69529&atid=524839) * Multiple events can now be selected when adding a raid. This will enter one raid per event selected. * Fixed a bug in the Location field for the "Who's Online" list on the admin index. * Fixed a bug in settings.php that occurred if no plugins were installed. * Fixed a bug in install.php with the admin's e-mail address.  * 12 bug fixes * 11 new features * 0 removed features * 5 notes    Version 1.0.0 - Feb 01, 2003  * [#664038](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=664038&group_id=69529&atid=524839) * [#664105](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=664105&group_id=69529&atid=524839) * Fixed a bug that stopped getting item stats if only one mirror existed. * [#664046](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=664046&group_id=69529&atid=524839) * An automatic individual adjustment can now be made when a member becomes active or inactive. * Added the plugin management control panel. * Added a plugin foundation. * Added the preview link for styles to the configuration panel. * Added control panels to manage and create styles. * Fixed a major bug that occurred when magic\_quotes\_gpc was off. * Added a 'Last 90 days' column to viewmember and listmembers (compare) to get a better overview of raid attendance. * Added a verbose list of the last 10 administrative actions to the admin index page. * Added a color preview next to the style color settings. * Added the raid note to a Summary view. * Added a check for the GET variable 'class' to listmembers. If set the one of the valid EverQuest classes, only members of that class will be displayed. * Added a stats and summary table for classes. Shows how many items that class got, the percentage of items, the number of members who are that class, and the percentage of members. Clicking on a class name will find all members of that class. * Users with administrative permissions now show up in bold on the Manage Users list. * Added a tag for text to be centered on the addnews page. * Install script now presents the user with EQdkp requirements and their server settings, to see if they meet the requirements. * Added a 'Loot Factor' to the class stats - see Feature Request [#672751](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=672751&group_id=69529&atid=524842) * Added a 'Last Loot' column when comparing members. This indicates when the member last purchased an item, if ever. * Restructured manage\_members.php. * Added a form to add/edit/delete individual members. Permissions are based off of a\_members\_man. * Added logging for adding, updating and deleting members.  * 5 bug fixes * 18 new features * 0 removed features * 1 notes    Legend  * Bug * Added Feature * Removed Feature * Note |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
