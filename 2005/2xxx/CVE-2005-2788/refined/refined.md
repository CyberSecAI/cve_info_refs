```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Land Down Under portal system is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to insufficient input sanitization in multiple PHP files (events.php, index.php, and list.php).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection vulnerability exists in the application. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input passed through the 'c' parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application's data.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP files (events.php, index.php, and list.php) by manipulating the 'c' parameter with SQL injection payloads, such as a single quote (').
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific authentication or other prerequisites are mentioned.
