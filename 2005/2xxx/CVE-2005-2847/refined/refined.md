Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `f` (filename) parameter within the `/cgi-bin/img.pl` script of the Barracuda Spam Firewall appliance. This allows for directory traversal and remote execution by manipulating the filename parameter.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:** The script doesn't validate the `f` parameter, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended directory.
    *  **Remote Code Execution:** The `open` function in Perl, when used with a pipe (`|`) at the end of a string, executes the string as a command and pipes the output. By using a crafted filename like `../bin/ls|`, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Password Exposure:** The vulnerability can be exploited to read configuration files containing sensitive information, such as the administrator password, which was stored in clear text.
    *  **Command Injection in Utilities:**  Vulnerabilities in the dig and tcpdump utilities where input sanitization was insufficient to prevent file system operations, and partial source code leaks.
    

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Reading:** Attackers can read any file accessible to the web server's user (nobody).
    *   **Arbitrary File Execution:** Attackers can execute commands with the privileges of the web server user.
    *   **Full System Configuration Reading:** Attackers can retrieve configuration files containing sensitive information, including cleartext passwords.
    * **System Audit:** Attackers can perform a full audit of the Barracuda spam firewall using the vulnerabilities.
  
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is via HTTP requests to the `/cgi-bin/img.pl` script, manipulating the `f` parameter.
    *   The utility section is accessed through `/cgi-bin/dig_device.cgi` and `/cgi-bin/tcpdump_device.cgi`.
    

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and needs network access to the Barracuda Spam Firewall appliance.
    *   **No Authentication:** Exploitation of the `/cgi-bin/img.pl` vulnerability does not require any prior authentication.
    *   **Knowledge of file paths:** The attacker needs to know the location of the configuration file to retrieve the password.
    *   **Admin Privileges (for the secondary vulnerability)**: exploitation of the utilities requires admin privileges, and is used to assist with gaining more insight into the system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that the `img.pl` script attempts to `unlink` the file after reading. Although the webserver user might have limited delete permission this is still a potential issue that could be exploited in other ways.
*   The fix is in firmware version 3.1.18, which addresses the vulnerability in `img.pl` and converts the script to `img.cgi`
*   The vulnerability was initially reported in June 2005, with public disclosure occurring on September 1, 2005 after the vendor had a fix available.
*   The content provides more details than a typical CVE description would.

**Relevance to CVE-2005-2847:**

The provided content directly relates to a vulnerability in the Barracuda Spam Firewall appliance, as detailed in the security advisory by SecuriWeb. The advisory does mention  `CVE-MAP-NOMATCH`, meaning it was not yet assigned a CVE. However, the details, especially the directory traversal and remote execution vulnerability in `img.pl`, match the general type of vulnerabilities that would be assigned to a CVE identifier.
