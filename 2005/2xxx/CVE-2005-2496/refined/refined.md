{
  "CVE-2005-2496": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ntp daemon (ntpd) incorrectly handles group IDs when specified as a string rather than a numeric GID on the command line with the `-u` option. It confuses the given group ID with the group ID of the given user.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect handling of group IDs leading to ntpd running with unintended privileges.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "ntpd could run with different privileges than intended, potentially granting unauthorized access or allowing for privilege escalation.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by starting the ntpd daemon with the -u option and specifying a group ID as a string rather than a numeric GID.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to start the ntpd daemon with specific command line arguments."
