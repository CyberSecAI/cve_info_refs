How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Geeklog 1.3.11sr1 and 1.3.9sr4

* Sunday, July 03 2005 @ 04:11 pm EDT
* Contributed by: [Dirk](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=408)
* Views: 23,995

[![Security](https://www.geeklog.net/images/topics/security.png "Security")](https://www.geeklog.net/index.php/topic/Security)

Stefan Esser has found an SQL injection vulnerability in Geeklog that can, under certain circumstances, be used to extract sensitive user data such as a user's password hash. We are therefore releasing security updates to address this issue and would advise you to upgrade ASAP.

There are upgrade archives available to upgrade from [Geeklog 1.3.11](http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/singlefile.php?lid=573) and [Geeklog 1.3.9sr3](http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/singlefile.php?lid=572), as well as a complete tarball for [Geeklog 1.3.11sr1](http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/singlefile.php?lid=574) (for new installations).

Users of Geeklog 1.3.10 please read on ...

As mentioned in the [release announcement](http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/geeklog-1.3.11) for Geeklog 1.3.11, there will be no further development for Geeklog 1.3.10. Consequentially, we are not releasing this security upgrade for 1.3.10. While it would be easy to provide such an upgrade, it would be pointless as 1.3.11 was itself a security upgrade for 1.3.10. So fixing this security issue would still leave you vulnerable to the issues with 1.3.10. You had over half a year to upgrade to 1.3.11 and if you still haven't done so, now would be a good time ... Use the 1.3.11sr1 tarball and go through all the usual upgrade steps. As mentioned before, the upgrade should be relatively painless as there were no changes in the themes and config.php from 1.3.10 to 1.3.11.

Ran into a problem...

Edited new lib-common.php file to correct path and Parse erro on line 4691

New file line:
}
else if( $A['type'] ']']']']== ']']']']==']']']==']']==']=='poll' )
{

Original File line:
}
else if( $A['type'] ']']== ']']==']=='poll' )
{

Looks odd to me

### Geeklog 1.3.11sr1 and 1.3.9sr4

Authored by: [n4th4n](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=4994) on Sunday, July 10 2005 @ 01:08 pm EDT

I just went from 1.3.9sr1 to sr4 in one go. At first I thought everything
was fine, but then noticed that the forum plugin no longer works. The
list of forums appears, but clicking on any of the forums in the list just
reloads the page. If I go to the forum admin page and attempt to click
on any listed post I get a Topic deleted? error. I think perms are all OK,
what else can I check?

The plugin reports itself as 2.3, though there is a changes-2.3.2 file in
the folder I archived. The geeklog version is listed as 1.3.8 in the
admin/plugins window.

OK - forget it. I was a bad hacker and had modified lib-common.php to
get around the register\_globals setting, and so when I replaced lib-
common.php with the updated version, the reg\_globals hack was not
there anymore, and so the forum didn't function anymore. I guess I didn't
check things out as thoroughly as I thought. Boy, that'll be nice in GL2 to
not have to worry about the Reg Globals thing...

Thanks! The instructions are right there, plain as day! Sorry about that.
I must have gotten ahead of myself or something. I edited my
config.php as instructed in the Read Me and all is well with the version

### Totally Crashes My Weblog

Authored by: [suspensewriter](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=9952) on Wednesday, July 20 2005 @ 11:04 am EDT

I have done the update (and undone it back to the original file) several times now, doublechecking variables, making sure that my text editor wasn't munging the code, etc. I get the same error message every time:

Warning: main(lib-common.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /my/path/tol/geeklog/index.php on line 37

Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required 'lib-common.php' (include\_path='.:/usr/lib/php') in /my/path/tol/geeklong/index.php on line 37

... where /my/path/tol/geeklong/ has been substituted for my actual working path.

Any idea where I might be going wrong?

Well, the error message pretty much says it all: It can't find the lib-common.php.

Either it's really missing or the permissions on the file are such that the webserver can't read it (that sounds a bit odd, though).

# Hardened PHP

PHP is far and away the most popular backend programming
language today, with more than 80 websites worldwide taking advantage of PHP
solutions.

All of the most popular CMS platforms – including WordPress,
Joomla!, and Drupal (just to name a few) leverage this technology. It’s
flexibility and versatility make it a powerhouse programming language, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean that it is as secure as it could or should be “right
out of the box”, so to speak.

It’s popularity, it’s widespread adaptation, and its
relatively easy to learn structure has made PHP a major target for cyber
criminals and hackers to exploit. This is why it’s mission-critical that you
harden your PHP files server-side as much as possible, protecting your server,
your content, and your visitors from these kinds of dangerous exploits.

PHP can be hardened manually as well as with patching
protocols. Below we highlight the steps you’ll want to take to make sure that
your PHP installation is as locked down as possible.

**Locate the PHP Config File You’re Hardening on Your Server**

The very first step in hardening your PHP installation is
first finding the PHP configuration file on your server to begin with.

Depending on the hosting that you are taking advantage of
(the actual provider as well as the type of hosting you have selected) it can
be in a variety of different locations. The best way to quickly locate this
critical file is to simply do a server-side search for “PHP.ini” as this is the
actual file that you’ll want to modify, edit, and harden moving forward.

**Editing the File on Shared Hosting**

Individuals looking to harden their PHP on a shared hosting platform (see [The Blog Starter](https://www.theblogstarter.com/) for hosting options) will have a bit of a tougher hill to climb, if only because most providers do not offer root access to the server with this level of hosting.

You’ll have to contact your hosting provider directly to see
if you can edit the main PHP.ini file itself. In the event that you aren’t
allowed this kind of access, you can still request to have access to the
“.HTaccess” file on your server to make the changes you need to.

You won’t be able to make changes quite as quickly this way
as you would have been able to with a patch (like we highlight below), but you
can manually make individual line edits to your PHP settings this way to enjoy
a higher level of security.

Shared hosting may still have limitations on the PHP elements you can edit no matter how much access you are granted. If you want total control over hardening your PHP (and total control over the security of your web platform), it’s not a bad idea to move to Dedicated or VPS servers if you can afford it.

**Editing the File on Dedicated/VPS servers**

If you are moving forward with a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or Dedicated server set up the process for hardening your PHP is a lot
easier, though it’s still not as quick as applying a server wide patch like we
highlight below.

In the backend administration toolset of your server
solution you’ll find a tool called the Web Host Manager. This is usually
located under the “Service Configuration” settings option in your backend
dashboard.

This tool is going to allow you to select the PHP
Configuration Editor, and editor that allows you to make changes to your
PHP.ini file through a more user-friendly interface than actually downloading
the file, opening it up in Notepad or a similar application, and then making
the edits individually with the actual source code itself.

There are a handful of individual settings that you’re going
to want to reconfigure manually when taking this approach to hardening your PHP
installation, including (but not limited to):

•           Remote
Connections

•           Run Time
Settings

•           Input Data
Restrictions

•           Error
Handling

•           Restrict
File Access

•           File
Uploads

•           Session
Security

•           Soap Cache

… And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

**Use a Patch like Suhosin to Harden PHP Almost Instantly**

The big attraction behind PHP is that it is so easy to learn,
so easy to develop with, and about as flexible as a programming language gets –
and that’s why a lot of people feel comfortable hardening their PHP manually,
running line by line through their PHP.ini file and doing the heavy lifting of
securing their system on their own.

And while you may be a top-tier programmer and feel
completely confident in your coding prowess, the truth of the matter is that if
you allow ANY coding from ANY outside developers to run on your server you’ll
still have vulnerabilities that you may not be able to address independently –
vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire platform.

This is why patching your PHP systemwide is such a savvy
move, and why so many developers, programmers, and website/web application
owners utilizing PHP decide to move forward with a solution like Suhosin.

Engineered specifically to provide an advanced layer of
protection to PHP installations, the Suhosin patch is a dual action component
that provides a level of hardening that may not be possible through any other
manual approach.

On the one hand, Suhosin works to patch the PHP core on your
server. This allows this patch to protect against issues like format string
vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and other issues that may plague your as of
yet unsecured PHP installation.

On the other hand, Suhosin also acts as an extension to the
PHP that has already been installed on your server. This extension runs 24/7,
around-the-clock, to protect against all kinds of vulnerabilities (including
runtime vulnerabilities) as well as individual session issues while adding a
whole host of logging, filtering, and administrative tools at the same time.

Best of all, the installation of this PHP hardening patch is
about as simple and as straightforward as it gets.

All of the features it has to offer exist within its
extension module and “flipping the switch” to allow that extension to run is as
easy as activating the individual extension inside of the PHP.ini file.
Sometimes you’ll have to manually add a couple of extra Configuration
Directives to trigger the full suite of extension capabilities, but most of the
time the Suhosin patch works just as soon as the edits to the PHP.ini file go
live.
