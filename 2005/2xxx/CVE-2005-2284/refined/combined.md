## WebEOC contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#372797

Original Release Date: 2005-07-13 | Last Revised: 2005-07-20

---

### Overview

WebEOC contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities that may allow attackers to execute sql queries, potentially viewing or modifying data, or executing database commands.

### Description

| WebEOC is a web-based crisis information management application that provides functions to gather, coordinate, and disseminate information between emergency personnel and Emergency Operations Centers (EOC). WebEOC does not properly filter user input, allowing a remote attacker to supply SQL commands that may be executed by the underlying database. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute SQL queries on a server, possibly with elevated privileges. As a result, attackers may be able to view or modify the contents of a WebEOC database, including authentication and sensitive medical information. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Version 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi:*Specific validation checks have been added to all input fields that appeared to be susceptible to SQL injection or cross-site scripting attacks to protect input fields against SQL injection or XSS attempts. In addition, all function parameters are validated in the application business logic. The validation process replaces ' with '' for String parameters, and for numeric parameters it verifies that the parameter is numeric. Such checks are a good first line of defense against SQL injection attacks.*To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi [Technical Support](http://www.esi911.com/esi/support/support.htm)*.* |
