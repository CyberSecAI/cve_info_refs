- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper filtering of user input in WebEOC, a web-based crisis information management application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially with elevated privileges. This allows them to view or modify the contents of the WebEOC database, including sensitive medical and authentication information, or execute database commands.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can supply malicious SQL commands through user input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability without needing any specific privileges or access to the server beyond what is required to interact with the web application.
