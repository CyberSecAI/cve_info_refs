# Clam AntiVirus: Integer overflows — GLSA **200507-25**

Clam AntiVirus is vulnerable to integer overflows when handling several
file formats, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.86.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.86.2** |

### Background

Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit, designed for integration
with mail servers to perform attachment scanning. Clam AntiVirus also
provides a command line scanner and a tool for fetching updates of the
virus database.

### Description

Neel Mehta and Alex Wheeler discovered that Clam AntiVirus is
vulnerable to integer overflows when handling the TNEF, CHM and FSG
file formats.

### Impact

By sending a specially-crafted file an attacker could execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running Clam AntiVirus.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Clam AntiVirus users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.86.2"
```

Vulnerability
ClamAV is the most widely used GPL antivirus library today. It provides file format \
support for virus analysis. During analysis ClamAV Antivirus Library is vulnerable to \
buffer overflows allowing attackers complete control of the system. These \
vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without user interaction or authentication \
through common protocols such as SMTP, SMB, HTTP, FTP, etc.

Specifically, ClamAV is responsible for parsing multiple file formats. At least 4 of \
its file format processors contain remote security bugs. Specifically, during the \
processing of TNEF, CHM, & FSG formats an attacker is able to trigger several integer \
overflows that allow attackers to overwrite heap data to obtain complete control of \
the system. These vulnerabilities can be reached by default and triggered without \
user interaction by sending an e-mail containing crafted data.

Impact
Successful exploitation of ClamAV protected systems allows attackers unauthorized \
control of data and related privileges. It also provides leverage for further network \
compromise. ClamAV implementations are likely vulnerable in their default \
configuration.

Affected Products
ClamAV â 0.86.1 (current) and prior

There are numerous implementations of ClamAV listed on their site which are likely \
vulnerable. One party of note is Apple. Apple includes ClamAV by default in Mac OS X \
Server. In addition, ClamAV has been ported to windows and a variety of other \
platforms by third parties who's implementations are also likely vulnerable. Refer to \
vendor for specifics.

Credit
These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Neel Mehta & Alex Wheeler.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
