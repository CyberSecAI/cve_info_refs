The provided content describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in UNB (Unclassified NewsBoard) version 1.5.3.

- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the description field when posting a message.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the description field of a forum post, which could then be executed by other users who view the post. This allows the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a crafted message submitted via the forum's post functionality. Specifically, by inserting a malicious <script> tag in the description field.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to post to the forum, they do not need any privileged access to the server. They need to have a basic understanding of HTML/JavaScript to craft the malicious payload.
