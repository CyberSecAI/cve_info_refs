Debian Security Advisory DSA 902-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
November 21st, 2005                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : xmail
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-2943

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the sendmail program of
xmail, an advanced, fast and reliable ESMTP/POP3 mail server that
could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with group mail
privileges.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain xmail packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.21-3sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xmail package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 alias sarge

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Xmail: Privilege escalation through sendmail â€” GLSA **200512-05**

The sendmail program in Xmail is vulnerable to a buffer overflow,
potentially resulting in local privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-mta/xmail** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.22** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.22** |

### Background

Xmail is an Internet and intranet mail server.

### Description

iDEFENSE reported that the AddressFromAtPtr function in the
sendmail program fails to check bounds on arguments passed from other
functions, and as a result an exploitable stack overflow condition
occurs when specifying the "-t" command line option.

### Impact

A local attacker can make a malicious call to sendmail,
potentially resulting in code execution with elevated privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Xmail users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-mta/xmail-1.22"
```

Multiple Vendor XMail 'sendmail' Recipient Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
iDEFENSE Security Advisory 10.13.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=321&type=vulnerabilities
October 13, 2005
I. BACKGROUND
XMail is an Internet and intranet mail server. XMail sources compile
under GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OSX, Solaris and NT/2K/XP.
More information can be found at the vendor website:
http://www.xmailserver.org/
II. DESCRIPTION
Local exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in XMail, as
distributed with multiple vendors' operating systems, allows local
attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
The vulnerability exists because of insufficent bounds checking on
user-supplied data. Specifically, the AddressFromAtPtr function fails to
check bounds on arguments passed from other functions, and as a result
an exploitable stack overflow condition occurs when specifying the "-t"
command line option. The "-t" command line option allows users to
specify the recipient value in the text of the message on a line
beginning with "To:". XMail passes the user-supplied value without
bounds checking to AdressFromAtPtr and attempts to store the hostname
portion of the e-mail address in a 256-byte buffer. Crafted e-mail
addresses can overflow the buffer and overwrite stack process control
data, resulting in local code execution with elevated privileges.
III. ANALYSIS
Successful exploitation will result in code execution with elevated
privileges. XMail is distributed in RPM, DEB and source format. The RPM
distribution installs the sendmail binary with setuid root privileges.
Exploitation of XMail installed from RPM will yield root. Other
distribution formats install the sendmail binary as setgid mail.
Exploitation resulting in group mail privileges will allow an attacker
to read all unencrypted mail stored locally in the system mail folders.
IV. DETECTION
iDEFENSE Labs has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in XMail
1.21.
V. WORKAROUND
As a workaround solution, local mail delivery can be restricted and a
standard mail user-agent may be used to talk to the XMail SMTP server.
VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
The vendor has released XMail 1.22 to address this issue which is
available for download at:
http://www.xmailserver.org/
VII. CVE INFORMATION
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CAN-2005-2943 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for
security problems.
VIII. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE
