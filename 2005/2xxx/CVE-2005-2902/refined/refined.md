Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the class-1 Forum Software (version 0.24.4) checks attachment extensions during file uploads. The code extracts the file extension by splitting the filename at the "." character. However, it fails to properly sanitize or validate the filename, which allows for malicious SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** By crafting a filename like `shell.php.' or 'a' ='a`, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query that checks the allowed extensions, bypassing the intended check. The vulnerable code is in `viewforum.php`, lines 256-272, as detailed in the advisory.
2.  **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not properly validate file extensions, which, combined with the SQL injection, enables uploading executable files (PHP) to the server.
3.  **Remote Code Execution:** Due to the ability to upload and execute PHP files, an attacker can achieve remote code execution by sending commands to the uploaded shell.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information by reading files on the server including database configuration files containing database credentials.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers may be able to modify or deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack is initiated through the forum's file upload functionality. It involves the following steps:
1.  **Registration:** The attacker registers a user account.
2.  **Login:** The attacker logs into the forum.
3.  **Upload a malicious file:** An attacker uploads a file with the crafted name such as `shell.php.' or 'a' ='a` as an attachment in a forum post.
4.  **Retrieve Upload Directory:** The attacker accesses `viewattach.php` to determine where the file was uploaded.
5.  **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker crafts a URL including the uploaded shell to execute arbitrary system commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs a web browser to access the vulnerable forum.
*   The attacker needs the ability to register on the forum and post attachments.
*   The attacker does not need any special access privileges other than being able to register and post.

**Additional details:**

The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit written in PHP, which automates the steps required to exploit this vulnerability. It includes:

*   Automatic registration of a new user
*   Login with the created user
*   Uploading of a specially crafted file using a multipart/form-data request
*   Retrieval of the upload directory
*   Execution of an arbitrary command

The PoC also allows the attacker to specify a proxy server to conduct the attack through it.
The attacker can use google dorks like `"Powered by and copyright class-1"` to find vulnerable systems.

The advisory indicates that both Windows and Linux based servers running Apache web server are vulnerable to this issue.
