Root cause of vulnerability:
The Oracle Reports parameter `desformat` and `customize` allows reading of arbitrary files by using an absolute or relative file name. Parts of the file content are then displayed in the Reports error message.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper input validation
- Information disclosure

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, leading to information disclosure of sensitive data such as configuration files and potentially other sensitive data that the Oracle Reports process has access to.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the Oracle Reports servlet (`rwservlet`) with a malicious `desformat` or `customize` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Oracle Reports servlet. No authentication is mentioned as a requirement.
