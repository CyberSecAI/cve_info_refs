    "source": "www.mail-archive.com_e1b7eed8_20250125_132702.html",
    "vulnerability": "A possible array overflow exists in the `struct sock` within the Linux kernel's XFRM (IPsec) code. When `setsockopt(SOL_IP, IP_XFRM_POLICY)` is called with `XFRM_POLICY_FWD` (value 2) as the direction, the `xfrm_sk_policy_insert()` function inserts a new policy into the `sk->sk_policy` array at the index given by the direction. The `sk_policy` array has only two elements (0 and 1). This leads to an out-of-bounds write, overflowing the `sk_policy` array and corrupting adjacent memory.",
    "impact": "The overflow of `sk_policy` is likely to only cause a deadlock, because the overwritten data, `rwlock_t sk_dst_lock`, only contains an unsigned integer. However, more serious consequences such as data corruption or code execution could be possible with other memory layouts.",
    "attack_vector": "Local exploitation by calling `setsockopt` with a crafted `xfrm_user` policy message that includes an invalid `XFRM_POLICY_FWD` direction.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local access to the system and the ability to create and manipulate sockets with the `setsockopt` syscall.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is a missing bounds check in `xfrm_sk_policy_insert()` before writing to `sk->sk_policy[dir]`. It fails to ensure the index `dir` is within the bounds of the `sk_policy` array."

        "vulnerability": "A local attacker could call setsockopt() with an invalid xfrm_user policy message which would cause the kernel to write beyond the boundaries of an array and crash.",
