## Analysis of CVE-2005-2558

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-2558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `init_syms()` function of MySQL. This function is responsible for initializing symbols for user-defined functions (UDFs).
- The `init_syms()` function copies a user-specified function name into a fixed-size buffer on the stack using an unsafe string function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is that the `init_syms()` function copies the user-supplied "function_name" without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow. The buffer is 50 bytes long, but the user-specified function name can be up to 64 bytes, causing the overflow.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The code fails to validate or sanitize the length of the "function_name" input, allowing an attacker to provide an oversized string.
- **Unsafe String Copy:** The use of unsafe string copy function contributes to the exploitability of the overflow, without limiting the copy operation to the allocated buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite portions of the stack. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the MySQL server process.
- **Server Crash:** If arbitrary code execution is not achieved, the buffer overflow can still cause the server process to crash due to stack corruption.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While the vulnerability requires the `CREATE FUNCTION` privilege, which is not generally given to untrusted users, this vulnerability can still have severe consequences when that privilege is granted and exploited, resulting in a complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** A remote attacker with the `CREATE FUNCTION` privilege can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Local:** A local user with the `CREATE FUNCTION` privilege can also trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **MySQL User Account:** The attacker must have a valid MySQL user account.
- **`CREATE FUNCTION` Privilege:** Crucially, the attacker must have the `CREATE FUNCTION` privilege within the MySQL database.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs when creating a user-defined function using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement.
- The `function_name` field, when exceeding 50 bytes, causes the stack-based buffer overflow within the `init_syms()` function.
- After the user-supplied string, hardcoded strings are also copied onto the stack, allowing for a predictable overwrite pattern that may be abused for EIP hijacking in some older versions of MySQL.
- The overflow allows the attacker to write 14 bytes of arbitrary data and 8 bytes of hardcoded data past the allocated buffer, resulting in memory corruption.

**Mitigation:**
- Apply the vendor provided patch and upgrade to MySQL versions 4.0.25, 4.1.13, or 5.0.7-beta.
- Restrict the `CREATE FUNCTION` privilege only to trusted users.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent oversized function names.
- Avoid the use of unsafe string copy functions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by AppSecInc Team SHATTER.
- This vulnerability is present in multiple versions of MySQL.

In summary, CVE-2005-2558 represents a serious vulnerability due to the potential for remote code execution in the context of the MySQL server. It highlights the importance of secure coding practices (such as bounds checking) and proper privilege management in database systems.
