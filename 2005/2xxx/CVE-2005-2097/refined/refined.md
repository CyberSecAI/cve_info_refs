  "CVE-2005-2097": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A bug in the font handling code of xpdf, present in kpdf and gpdf.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input sanitization leading to infinite resource consumption (CPU and disk space) or potentially arbitrary code execution via heap based buffer overflows.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (resource exhaustion), application crash, or potential arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted PDF file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a specially crafted PDF file to a user."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer overflows in xpdf's PDF handling, also present in libextractor.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows due to incorrect input sanitization when processing PDF files.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service through application crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Processing a malicious PDF file via libextractor",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a specially crafted PDF file to be processed by an application using libextractor. Remote exploitation is possible."
