Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root cause:** The Foojan PHP Weblog software improperly handles the `HTTP_REFERER` header. The `gmain.php` script inserts the raw value of `$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']` directly into the database without any sanitization.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of input sanitization/validation. The application does not sanitize the HTTP Referer header before inserting it into the database.
*   **Impact:** This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the `refferer` field in the database. When this data is later displayed on `index.php` or `admin.php`, the injected code is executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The attacker could inject JavaScript to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Although the primary issue is XSS, it can lead to information disclosure if the attacker uses the XSS vulnerability to access sensitive information within the victim's browser or application.

**Attack Vector:**

*   An attacker crafts an HTTP request that includes a malicious payload in the `Referer` header. This header's value is stored in the database. When the weblog displays visitor information, this stored, malicious payload is embedded into the webpage.
*   When other users view the weblog page, the injected malicious code in the `refferer` field executes in their browsers, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the weblog application, and control the contents of the `Referer` header of the HTTP request.
*   No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability is based on the weblog software's handling of the `Referer` header and the lack of sanitization when displaying it.

**Additional details (from the marc.info content):**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `gmain.php` file, specifically the database query that inserts visit information.
*   The vulnerability affects both the public `index.php` and the `admin.php` pages.
*   The attacker can inject HTML code, which can include malicious JavaScript, by setting the `Referer` header.

This vulnerability is related to the CVE because it describes a specific instance of XSS resulting from unsanitized user controlled data (HTTP Referer Header) being injected into the database and later rendered on pages leading to malicious code execution in the victim's browser.
