The *Courier* mail transfer agent (MTA) is an
integrated mail/groupware server based on open commodity
protocols, such as ESMTP, IMAP, POP3, LDAP, SSL, and HTTP.
*Courier* provides ESMTP, IMAP, POP3, webmail, and mailing
list services within a single, consistent, framework. Individual
components can be enabled or disabled at will. The
*Courier* mail server now implements basic web-based
calendaring and scheduling services integrated in the webmail
module. Advanced groupware calendaring services will follow
soon.

The *Courier* mail server's source code should compile
on most POSIX-based operating systems based on Linux, and
BSD-derived kernels. The *Courier* mail server should also
compile on Solaris and AIX, with some help from Sun's or IBM's
freeware add-on tools for their respective operating systems.

The *Courier* mail server evolved out of several
related projects, that merged together (more on that later). The
*Courier* mail server implements SMTP extensions for
mailing list management and spam filtering. The *Courier*
mail server can function as an intermediate mail relay, relaying
mail between an internal LAN and the Internet, or perform final
delivery to mailboxes. The *Courier* mail server uses
[maildirs](https://www.courier-mta.org/mbox-vs-maildir/) as its native mail storage format, but it can
also deliver mail to legacy mailbox files as well. The
*Courier* mail server's configuration is set by plain text
files and Perl scripts. Most of The *Courier* mail
server's configuration can now be adjusted from a web browser,
using The *Courier* mail server's web-based administration
module.

The *Courier* mail server can provide mail services for
regular operating system accounts. The *Courier* mail
server can also provide mail services for virtual mail accounts,
managed by an LDAP, MySQL, or PostgreSQL-based authentication
database.

Certain portions of the *Courier* mail server -
[the mail filtering engine](https://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/), the [webmail server](https://www.courier-mta.org/sqwebmail/) and the [IMAP server](https://www.courier-mta.org/imap/) -
are also available as separate, smaller, packages that can be
used with other mail servers.

## Features

* Can be configured to function as an intermediate mail
  relay, or as a mail server that receives mail for multiple
  domains and makes it accessible to mail clients, or anything in
  between.
* On servers with multiple IP addresses, optionally assign a
  [vanity configuration to
  *Courier* for each IP address](courier.html#multihomed), making each IP
  address look like a separate, dedicated, mail server instance,
  for both incoming and outgoing mail. An alternative limited
  vanity configuration for outgoing mail only, based on the
  sending mail client's authenticated login, is possible when
  multiple IP addresses are not available.
* Web-based administration and configuration tool.
* Local mailboxes can be accessed via POP3. The
  *Courier* mail server includes an integrated POP3
  server.
* Local mailboxes can be accessed via IMAP. The
  *Courier* mail server includes an integrated IMAP
  server.
* A built-in IMAP/POP3 aggregator proxy. It is possible to
  distribute all mailboxes between multiple servers. A separate
  server (or a pool of servers) accepts connections from IMAP or
  POP3 clients, then connects to the right server based on the
  mailbox the connecting client is logging into.
* Local mailboxes can be accessed via HTTP. The
  *Courier* mail server includes an [integrated webmail
  server](/sqwebmail/screenshots.html).
* The webmail server includes a personal [event
  calendar](https://www.courier-mta.org/sqwebmail/images/monthly.png).
* Uses an efficient [maildir](https://www.courier-mta.org/mbox-vs-maildir/)
  format as its native mail storage format. Some support is
  provided for legacy mbox mailboxes.
* Flexible "Sender Policy Framework" support; the ESMTP
  `HELO`, `MAIL FROM`, and the
  `From:` header can be validated using SPF.
* DSN, PIPELINING, and 8BITMIME ESMTP extensions. The
  *Courier* mail server automatically converts 8-bit
  messages to 7-bit encoding, for relaying mail to external mail
  gateways.
* STARTTLS ESMTP extension (as well as
  IMAP/POP3/ESMTP/Webmail over SSL) in both the client and the
  server (requires OpenSSL). The ESMTP client can optionally
  require that the remote server's X.509 certificate is signed by
  a trusted root CA (a default set of root CAs is provided).
* Experimental TLS/SSL enhancements which are designed to
  implement a secure mail delivery channel between trusted
  domains, over an untrusted network. This is implemented by
  requiring mail to select domains use TLS/SSL connections which
  require the remote server to present an X.509 certificate
  signed by a private (not a public) certificate authority. This
  is pretty much the highest level of security that can be
  achieved with today's technologies. This doesn't even require
  DNSsec. Even if the DNS cache is poisoned with MX records that
  divert mail to a rogue relay, the attacker will not have an
  X.509 certificate signed by a private CA (this assumes, of
  course, that the security of the private CA hasn't been
  breached). This work is mostly complete, but still needs a
  little testing.
* Message submission protocol (RFC 2476).
* IPv6 support (experimental).
* NOTE: the integrated servers work with maildir-based
  mailboxes only. There are many existing POP3, IMAP, and webmail
  servers that provide excellent support for mbox-based
  mailboxes, so there's no reason to reinvent the wheel. Some
  popular mbox servers are: [Qpopper](http://www.eudora.com/qpopper/), [UW-IMAP](http://www.washington.edu/imap/),
  and [NeoMail](http://neomail.sourceforge.net/).
* A faxmail gateway (experimental) that forwards E-mail
  messages via fax (requires a compatible class 2 faxmodem). The
  *Courier* mail server doesn't implement the actual
  faxing all by itself, actually. The *Courier* mail
  server uses additional software (which must be separately
  installed), to take care of the low-level details. The popular
  [mgetty+sendfax](http://alpha.greenie.net/mgetty/) package
  talks to the faxmodem and handles the actual faxing. Conversion
  of E-mail messages to fax pages is done by [ghostscript](http://www.ghostscript.com/), troff or
  [groff](http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/groff.html), and
  the [NetPBM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/) library. The
  *Courier* mail server glues all of these pieces together
  in a seamless manner any time an E-mail message addressed to
  `<phonenumber@fax>` is received. The main
  textual body of the E-mail message is placed on a cover page,
  and any attachments are converted to fax image format and
  transmitted after the cover page. At this time, The
  *Courier* mail server knows how to send plain text, PDF,
  and Postscript attachments. GIF, JPEG, and PNG images can be
  sent to (one image per page). The additional software packages
  that were mentioned previously are usually already included in
  most Linux and BSD installations. In most cases no additional
  software really needs to be installed in order to get
  faxmailing up and running.
* The *Courier* mail server includes a mailing list
  manager, with fully automatic bounce processing.
* You don't need a full-blown mail server? *Courier*
  mail server's [IMAP server](https://www.courier-mta.org/imap/), [webmail
  server](https://www.courier-mta.org/sqwebmail/), and [mail filter](https://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/) are
  available as independent packages that can be used with other
  mail servers (as long as the other mail servers store mail in
  [maildirs](maildir.html)).
  These sub-packages are assembled from the same source code
  tree. The only difference is the top level makefile. Note: the
  independent builds are not always in sync with the main the
  *Courier* mail server build at any given time. They
  follow their own schedule, and may include a slightly older, or
  even more recent, code base! Over time, however, everything
  always syncs together since all builds are assembled from the
  same source code repository.
* SOCKSv5 support. The *Courier* mail server can punch
  through a SOCKS firewall to send outgoing mail. Receiving mail
  through a SOCKS firewall is not yet supported. To use SOCKS you
  need to install the *Courier* mail server's Socks 5
  proxy client library.
* PAM, LDAP, PostgreSQL (beta), or MySQL authentication. LDAP
  authentication requires [OpenLDAP](http://www.openldap.org) to be installed.
  LDAP-based mail routing is also supported.
* Gateway mail to/from UUCP (if compatible UUCP software is
  separately installed).
* Authenticated SMTP.
* `XVERP` and `XEXDATA` ESMTP
  extensions.
* DNS-based blacklists. Ability to exempt whitelisted IP
  addresses from the blacklists.
* Integrated mail filtering. An API is provided for
  installing arbitrary external mail filters, and the system
  administrator can selectively enable for any mail source
  (ESMTP, UUCP, locally submitted mail) for filtering. Two
  example mail filters are included - one written in C that uses
  threads, and a Perl-based filter. The system administrator can
  also enable the ability for individual mail recipients to
  specify their own mail filtering rules, using a scripting
  language (implemented by `maildrop`, see below).
  Mail filtering is implemented as an integral part of the mail
  server. Unwanted mail is rejected, and is not accepted by the
  *Courier* mail server for delivery (the external mail
  relay receives the error, and it becomes the external relay's
  problem as to what to do with unwanted junk mail).
* Partial ability to import `sendmail`'s aliases
  file, but not all aspects of `sendmail`'s aliasing
  is supported - like delivering to programs, for example. Still,
  most simple `aliases` files should be usable.
* Optional ability to import most of `Qmail`'s
  `.qmail` files (*Courier* mail server uses an
  almost 100% compatible local mail delivery instruction
  format).
* Most major components of the *Courier* mail server
  can be installed in non-default directories, allowing extreme
  customization for your particular environment.
* You can set a maximum number of messages to deliver
  simultaneously to the same host. This, in fact, is strongly
  encouraged so that a single nonfunctioning domain does not take
  up all available delivery slots. Rate limiting is implemented
  in the main scheduler, and applies to any transport mechanism,
  not just ESMTP.
* Mailing list administrators can specify a backup relay and
  have mail that's not immediately deliverable offloaded to a
  backup server (this feature needs testing/feedback).

However, it is also important to note what the
*Courier* mail server does not have or will not
support:

* `.forward` files are partially supported. The
  *Courier* mail server can import most basic
  `/etc/aliases` files from [sendmail](http://www.sendmail.org), but sendmail's
  `.forward` and `/etc/aliases` files are
  simply not 100% compatible with the *Courier* mail
  server's security model. Most `.forward` and
  `/etc/aliases` files should be acceptable, but some
  may not.
* `ETRN` is not, and will never be implemented.
  It's a hack, and is functionally incompatible with the
  *Courier* mail server's internal message dispatcher. If
  a mail node does not have constant network connectivity, there
  are better ways of arranging for mail transport than ETRN. The
  transient mail node should download mail via IMAP, or maybe
  even UUCP.
* Workarounds for known defects in other mail software. The
  *Courier* mail server will not accept mail with raw
  8-bit characters in the headers, because they are illegal.
  There are well-defined protocols that must be used to encode
  8-bit text in mail headers. Non-compliant messages may result
  in the *Courier* mail server itself issuing corrupted
  delivery status notifications, or mishandling the message in
  several other ways. Because of that corrupted mail will simply
  not be accepted. Neither will the *Courier* mail server
  deliver mail to domains with improperly-defined MX records,
  even though other mail servers ignore the bad data.
  Additionally, certain popular IMAP mail clients are known to
  not work with the *Courier* mail server's IMAP server,
  due to an improper IMAP implementation by the mail client.
* Scripting language for rewriting mail headers. Mail
  rewriting rules are hardcoded, and are expected to be
  sufficient in most cases. If you have an unusual situation that
  requires some oddball header rewriting, you'll have to
  implement it yourself.
* Support for mbox mailboxes in the POP3, IMAP, and webmail
  components. They support maildirs only. There are plenty of
  existing servers out there that read mbox mailboxes.

## Requirements

* A C++ compiler, `egcs` is recommended. Most of
  the *Courier* mail server are written in C, but several
  major sections are written in C++.
* GNU make. Other `make`s may work, but that's not
  guaranteed.
* Either the GDBM or Berkeley DB library must be available.
  Only certain versions of Berkeley DB API are supported, because
  the Berkeley DB API often changes (tested with 2.4.14 and
  1.8.5). GDBM is the recommended library.
* Perl 5.
* The file system must support FIFOs. At least the file
  system that stores the mail queue must be able to support
  FIFOs. The *Courier* mail server will not work with
  AFS.
* Filesystem domain sockets must be available.
* Some optional components have additional dependencies -
  notably the additional software required for faxmail support
  (see above).

## Additional information

Here is a somewhat more detailed
overview of the *Courier* mail server's less prominent
features:
### Upgrade path

The *Courier* mail server can be
installed on systems that were previously running sendmail or
Qmail. Please note that the *Courier* mail server will be
able to support most major features of both servers, however the
*Courier* mail server is not, and will never be a
100%-compatible replacement for either sendmail or Qmail. The
*Courier* mail server does not implement several legacy
features of either MTA, and there are no plans to implement them
in the future. The key differences are:

* sendmail

A local mail delivery agent, such as `procmail`,
should be used for maximum compatibility with sendmail.

The *Courier* mail server expects system mailboxes to
be in the users' home directories. If your system mailboxes are
all stored separately, in `/var/spool/mail` or
somewhere else, you'll need to use a local delivery agent such as
`procmail`.

The *Courier* mail server uses a filesystem lock on
mailbox files, The *Courier* mail server does not support
old-fashioned dot-locking. If you need dot-locking, use
`procmail` or `maildrop` (included).

* Qmail

A configuration switch allows the *Courier* mail server
to read `$HOME/.qmail` files, however the
*Courier* mail server's implementation is not 100%
identical to Qmail's. The *Courier* mail server's
`aliases` file is also used to implement Qmail-style
virtual domains. A simple Perl script can be used to convert
Qmail's `control/virtualdomains` into
`aliases` entries.

The *Courier* mail server supports Maildirs
natively.

The *Courier* mail server can use the
`maildrop` mail filter as a local mail delivery agent.
`maildrop` is optional, but, if used, The
*Courier* mail server will take advantage of certain
`maildrop`-specific features which optimize local mail
delivery.

## Mail filters

The *Courier* mail server has hooks
for optional, site-defined, mail filters. You'll have to write
them yourself, though. The administrator-defined mail filters can
block the message from being accepted by the *Courier*
mail server (if messages comes in via SMTP, the SMTP server will
reject it). The *Courier* mail server can also be
configured to pause for a short period of time before attempting
to deliver a message. If the mail filter detects a slew of
duplicate messages coming in, the mail filter can block all
future copies, and manually bounce the handful of copies from the
queue. The system administrator can selectively enable filtering
for any individual mail source (ESMTP, locally submitted mail,
UUCP). The system administrator can also optionally enable
recipient-specified mail filters. With recipient-specified mail
filtering enabled, any local mail recipient can install an
arbitrary mail filter to selectively accept or reject mail based
on any criteria.

Currently the mail filtering API is not very well documented,
but it's there.

## ESMTP extensions

The *Courier* mail server
implements `AUTH`, `PIPELINING`,
`[DSN](courierdsn.html)`,
`SIZE`, and `8BITMIME` extensions to SMTP.
The *Courier* mail server also includes a reference
implementation of the experimental `XVERP` and
`XEXDATA` extensions.

The *Courier* mail server is a closed mail relay by
default. The *Courier* mail server cannot be accidentally
configured as a completely open relay. A deliberate feat of
stupidity is required for that to happen.

## ESMTP BOFH

The *Courier* mail server does not
deliver mail to domains with broken MX records. The
*Courier* mail server also refuses to accept any mail with
a return address in a domain with broken MX records.

The *Courier* mail server can automatically blacklist
domains whose mail servers reject delivery status
notifications.

## Header rewriting

The *Courier* mail server will
rewrite headers and MIME-ify messages whenever appropriate.
Header rewriting logic is hardcoded in C, there is no header
rewriting language as in sendmail. An interpreted language
imposes a drastic speed penalty. The rewriting library is fairly
simple, and the the standard rewriting rules will do for most
situations.

The *Courier* mail server rejects messages with
badly-formed or missing MIME headers. The *Courier* mail
server rejects messages containing 8-bit characters in the
headers, or messages that contain 8-bit content, but do not have
the required MIME headers. Accepting malformed messages of that
kind can result in the *Courier* mail server itself
sending mail that violates the relevant RFCs, therefore
*Courier* mail server will simply reject
improperly-formatted messages. There are well-defined RFC
standards that explicitly spell out how mail containing 8-bit
content or 8-bit headers should be encoded, and those standards
will have to be properly implemented by anyone that wishes their
mail to be accepted.

## Modularity

Message scheduling, dispatching, and the
actual transport mechanism are completely modularized. Different
message transport mechanisms such as UUCP can be implemented in a
simple plug-in fashion, however some C coding will be required.
## Message scheduling

The *Courier* mail server
supports VERPs, multiple recipients per message, and
RFC1894-compliant delivery status notifications.
## Load limiting

You can set a maximum number of messages to
deliver simultaneously to the same host. This, in fact, is
strongly encouraged so that a single nonfunctioning domain does
not take up all available delivery slots. Rate limiting is
implemented in the main scheduler, and applies to any transport
mechanism, not just ESMTP.
## Automatic restarts and garbage cleanup

The
*Courier* mail server's scheduling engine restarts itself
automatically, on a regular basis. This helps with memory
fragmentation. The *Courier* mail server tries to restart
itself during periods of system inactivity.
## Smart organization of the message queue and temporary directories

The *Courier* mail server automatically
creates subdirectories when necessary, and deletes them when
they're empty. When there's a sudden peak in the number of
messages added to the queue, directories used to store the
messages grow in size to accomodate the additional entries. On
many file systems, once those messages are deleted, the empty
slack space in the directory is not reclaimed, and actually slows
down subsequent directory operations. The *Courier* mail
server automatically removes empty directories, reclaiming the
slack space.
## Smart installation layout

The *Courier* mail server's configuration script will
install the *Courier* mail server into
`/usr/lib/courier` by default. Everything will go into
several subdirectories there: the actual binaries, configuration
files, the mail queue, manual pages, and auxiliary support files.
Optional configuration switches allow pretty much every major
subdirectory to be relocated anywhere else. For example, the Red
Hat RPM package for the *Courier* mail server relocates
the configuration files to `/etc/courier`, the manual
pages to `/usr/man`, and the mail queue to
`/var/spool/courier`.

## Mailing lists

The *Courier* mail server can implement both sendmail
and qmail-style address aliases. De-duping of sendmail-style
aliases is automatic. The *Courier* mail server source
distribution also includes a complete mailing list manager.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
