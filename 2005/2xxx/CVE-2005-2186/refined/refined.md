{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient access control and input validation in the McAfee IntruShield Security Management System (MISMS).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "HTML Injection: Embedding arbitrary HTML code in URLs.",
        "JavaScript Injection: Embedding and executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser context via URLs.",
        "Privilege Escalation: Accessing restricted areas and functions by manipulating URL parameters (e.g., changing `fullAccess=false` to `fullAccess=true`).",
        "Information Disclosure: Accessing sensitive information about managed devices by bypassing access controls.",
         "Credential Brute-Forcing: User IDs are passed in the URL, making it easy to brute-force to find a privileged account."
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can execute malicious scripts in the context of legitimate users, leading to account hijacking, data manipulation, and unauthorized access to sensitive information and administrative functionalities.  Attackers can also steal user credentials via crafted login pages.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulation of URL parameters.",
        "Injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code within URLs.",
        "Brute-forcing user IDs."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "A valid user account with access to the McAfee IntruShield Security Management System (MISMS) is required to exploit the HTML and Javascript injection, privilege escalation vulnerabilities. However, brute-forcing user IDs does not require a valid user account initially. Access to the MISMS web interface is required for all vulnerabilities."
