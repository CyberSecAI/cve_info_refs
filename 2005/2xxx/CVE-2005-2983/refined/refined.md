Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of "lexical references" in Oracle Reports without proper input validation. Lexical references are placeholders for text embedded in SQL statements, allowing clauses like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc., to be modified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. By manipulating the values of parameters associated with lexical references, attackers can inject arbitrary SQL code into the queries executed by Oracle Reports.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Oracle Reports does not inherently validate the input provided to lexical references. This allows malicious users to inject SQL syntax. The issue is not with the tool itself, but with how developers use it without validating input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data by crafting SQL injection queries.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Depending on the permissions of the Oracle Reports user, an attacker may be able to modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the user account executing the report has high privileges (e.g., DBA), attackers could gain elevated access to the database. They can potentially access hashkeys of database users, and if the passwords are weak or short, they could retrieve plaintext passwords using tools.
*   **Complete compromise of the database**

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating URL parameters, specifically by adding `paramform=yes` to the URL of an Oracle Report. This triggers a parameter form window, where injected SQL statements can be supplied via the parameter values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Oracle Reports server to send modified requests.
*   **Knowledge of Oracle Reports and SQL:**  The attacker needs to be familiar with how lexical references work in Oracle Reports and have the ability to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory emphasizes that the issue is not a flaw in Oracle Reports itself, but rather a result of developers failing to validate input when using lexical references.
*   The fix requires developers to manually implement input validation for all parameters used in lexical references, typically within the After-Parameter-Form-Trigger.
*   The advisory was initially sent to Oracle in May 2004 and publicly disclosed in September 2005.
*   The vulnerability affects a wide range of Oracle reports, including those in the E-Business Suite and custom applications using lexical references.
*   The advisory provides a test case and a demonstration of the exploit, showcasing how parameters can be manipulated to inject SQL queries.
