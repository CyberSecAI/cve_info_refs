Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied inputs in the `login.php` script before using them in an SQL query. Specifically, the `$username` and `$passwd` variables taken from POST requests are directly injected into the SQL query without any form of validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting malicious input in the `username` field, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query to bypass authentication, escalate privileges, or disclose sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the login mechanism without knowing a valid password by injecting SQL fragments that always evaluate to true (e.g., `' OR 'x'='x`).
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain administrative privileges by logging in as a normal user but injecting SQL to bypass authentication for an admin user.
- **Path Disclosure:**  By injecting invalid SQL, error messages can be triggered, potentially revealing sensitive path information about the web server and application.
- **Database Compromise:** The vulnerability could be further exploited to perform unauthorized actions on the database, potentially leading to data breaches or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the application via `login.php`.
- Specifically, the attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `username` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `login.php` script.
- The attacker does not need any pre-existing user accounts. The injection can be used to directly bypass authentication mechanisms.
