  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `secure.php` file of PHPSecurePages. The script includes files based on the `cfgProgDir` parameter without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This could result in complete compromise of the vulnerable application and the server it is hosted on.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is performed via an HTTP GET request, by injecting a malicious URL in the `cfgProgDir` parameter of the `secure.php` script.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They need a publicly accessible web server or a file hosting service to host their malicious file."
