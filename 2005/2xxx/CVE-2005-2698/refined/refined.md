- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `keywords` parameter within `browse.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks when a victim views the crafted URL.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `keywords` parameter, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when a user visits the link. Specifically, the user-supplied input is reflected back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and needs to trick a victim into visiting that URL.
