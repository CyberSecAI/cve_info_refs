Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the AppKit component of Apple's Mac OS X. This component is responsible for handling Microsoft Word (.doc) files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow. This implies that when processing a specially crafted .doc file, the AppKit component attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By exploiting the buffer overflow, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- Privilege escalation: The attacker-supplied code executes with the privileges of the user who opens the malicious .doc file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted .doc files: The primary attack vector involves delivering a specially crafted Microsoft Word document to a user.
- User interaction: The user needs to open the malicious .doc file for the exploit to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to supply a malicious .doc file: The attacker needs to be able to deliver or convince the user to open a crafted .doc file.
- No specific position is mentioned beyond being able to deliver a file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects applications that use AppKit (e.g., TextEdit), not Microsoft Word for Mac OS X itself.
- A patch has been released by Apple in Security Update 2005-007.
