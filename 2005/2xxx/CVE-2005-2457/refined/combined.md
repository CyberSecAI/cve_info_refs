How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2004-0887

    Martin Schwidefsky discovered that the privileged instruction SACF (Set
    Address Space Control Fast) on the S/390 platform is not handled properly,
    allowing for a local user to gain root privileges.

CVE-2004-1058

    A race condition allows for a local user to read the environment variables
    of another process that is still spawning through /proc/.../cmdline.

CVE-2004-2607

    A numeric casting discrepancy in sdla_xfer allows local users to read
    portions of kernel memory via a large len argument which is received as an
    int but cast to a short, preventing read loop from filling a buffer.

CVE-2005-0449

    An error in the skb_checksum_help() function from the netfilter framework
    has been discovered that allows the bypass of packet filter rules or
    a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-1761

    A vulnerability in the ptrace subsystem of the IA-64 architecture can
    allow local attackers to overwrite kernel memory and crash the kernel.

CVE-2005-2457

    Tim Yamin discovered that insufficient input validation in the compressed
    ISO file system (zisofs) allows a denial of service attack through
    maliciously crafted ISO images.

CVE-2005-2555

    Herbert Xu discovered that the setsockopt() function was not restricted to
    users/processes with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. This allows attackers to
    manipulate IPSEC policies or initiate a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2709

    Al Viro discovered a race condition in the /proc handling of network devices.
    A (local) attacker could exploit the stale reference after interface shutdown
    to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code in kernel mode.

CVE-2005-2973

    Tetsuo Handa discovered that the udp_v6_get_port() function from the IPv6 code
    can be forced into an endless loop, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3257

    Rudolf Polzer discovered that the kernel improperly restricts access to the
    KDSKBSENT ioctl, which can possibly lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2005-3783

    The ptrace code using CLONE_THREAD didn't use the thread group ID to
    determine whether the caller is attaching to itself, which allows a denial
    of service attack.

CVE-2005-3806

    Yen Zheng discovered that the IPv6 flow label code modified an incorrect variable,
    which could lead to memory corruption and denial of service.

CVE-2005-3848

    Ollie Wild discovered a memory leak in the icmp_push_reply() function, which
    allows denial of service through memory consumption.

CVE-2005-3857

    Chris Wright discovered that excessive allocation of broken file lock leases
    in the VFS layer can exhaust memory and fill up the system logging, which allows
    denial of service.

CVE-2005-3858

    Patrick McHardy discovered a memory leak in the ip6_input_finish() function from
    the IPv6 code, which allows denial of service.

CVE-2005-4618

    Yi Ying discovered that sysctl does not properly enforce the size of a
    buffer, which allows a denial of service attack.

The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:

                                     Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     Source                          2.4.27-10sarge2
     Alpha architecture              2.4.27-10sarge2
     ARM architecture                2.4.27-2sarge2
     Intel IA-32 architecture        2.4.27-10sarge2
     Intel IA-64 architecture        2.4.27-10sarge2
     Motorola 680x0 architecture     2.4.27-3sarge2
     Big endian MIPS architecture    2.4.27-10.sarge1.040815-2
     Little endian MIPS architecture 2.4.27-10.sarge1.040815-2
     PowerPC architecture            2.4.27-10sarge2
     IBM S/390 architecture          2.4.27-2sarge2
     Sun Sparc architecture          2.4.27-9sarge2

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatability with or to take advantage of this update:

                                     Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     kernel-latest-2.4-alpha         101sarge1

     lm-sensors                      1:2.9.1-1sarge3
     mindi-kernel                    2.4.27-2sarge1
     pcmcia-modules-2.4.27-i386      3.2.5+2sarge1
     systemimager                    3.2.3-6sarge1

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

This update introduces a change in the kernel's binary interface, the affected
kernel packages inside Debian have been rebuilt, if you're running local addons
you'll need to rebuild these as well.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get dist-upgrade

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2004-1017

    Multiple overflows exist in the io_edgeport driver which might be usable
    as a denial of service attack vector.

CVE-2005-0124

    Bryan Fulton reported a bounds checking bug in the coda_pioctl function
    which may allow local users to execute arbitrary code or trigger a denial
    of service attack.

CVE-2005-0449

    An error in the skb_checksum_help() function from the netfilter framework
    has been discovered that allows the bypass of packet filter rules or
    a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2457

    Tim Yamin discovered that insufficient input validation in the zisofs driver
    for compressed ISO file systems allows a denial of service attack through
    maliciously crafted ISO images.

CVE-2005-2490

    A buffer overflow in the sendmsg() function allows local users to execute
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2005-2555

    Herbert Xu discovered that the setsockopt() function was not restricted to
    users/processes with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. This allows attackers to
    manipulate IPSEC policies or initiate a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2709

    Al Viro discovered a race condition in the /proc handling of network devices.
    A (local) attacker could exploit the stale reference after interface shutdown
    to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code in kernel mode.

CVE-2005-2800

    Jan Blunck discovered that repeated failed reads of /proc/scsi/sg/devices
    leak memory, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2973

    Tetsuo Handa discovered that the udp_v6_get_port() function from the IPv6 code
    can be forced into an endless loop, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3044

    Vasiliy Averin discovered that the reference counters from sockfd_put() and
    fput() can be forced into overlapping, which allows a denial of service attack
    through a null pointer dereference.

CVE-2005-3053

    Eric Dumazet discovered that the set_mempolicy() system call accepts a negative
    value for it's first argument, which triggers a BUG() assert. This allows a
    denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3055

    Harald Welte discovered that if a process issues a USB Request Block (URB)
    to a device and terminates before the URB completes, a stale pointer
    would be dereferenced.  This could be used to trigger a denial of service
    attack.

CVE-2005-3180

    Pavel Roskin discovered that the driver for Orinoco wireless cards clears
    it's buffers insufficiently. This could leak sensitive information into
    user space.

CVE-2005-3181

    Robert Derr discovered that the audit subsystem uses an incorrect function to
    free memory, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3257

    Rudolf Polzer discovered that the kernel improperly restricts access to the
    KDSKBSENT ioctl, which can possibly lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2005-3356

    Doug Chapman discovered that the mq_open syscall can be tricked into
    decrementing an internal counter twice, which allows a denial of service attack
    through a kernel panic.

CVE-2005-3358

    Doug Chapman discovered that passing a 0 zero bitmask to the set_mempolicy()
    system call leads to a kernel panic, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3783

    The ptrace code using CLONE_THREAD didn't use the thread group ID to
    determine whether the caller is attaching to itself, which allows a denial
    of service attack.

CVE-2005-3784

    The auto-reaping of childe processes functionality included ptraced-attached
    processes, which allows denial of service through dangling references.

CVE-2005-3806

    Yen Zheng discovered that the IPv6 flow label code modified an incorrect variable,
    which could lead to memory corruption and denial of service.

CVE-2005-3847

    It was discovered that a threaded real-time process, which is currently dumping
    core can be forced into a dead-lock situation by sending it a SIGKILL signal,
    which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3848

    Ollie Wild discovered a memory leak in the icmp_push_reply() function, which
    allows denial of service through memory consumption.

CVE-2005-3857

    Chris Wright discovered that excessive allocation of broken file lock leases
    in the VFS layer can exhaust memory and fill up the system logging, which allows
    denial of service.

CVE-2005-3858

    Patrick McHardy discovered a memory leak in the ip6_input_finish() function from
    the IPv6 code, which allows denial of service.

CVE-2005-4605

    Karl Janmar discovered that a signedness error in the procfs code can be exploited
    to read kernel memory, which may disclose sensitive information.

CVE-2005-4618

    Yi Ying discovered that sysctl does not properly enforce the size of a buffer, which
    allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2006-0095

    Stefan Rompf discovered that dm_crypt does not clear an internal struct before freeing
    it, which might disclose sensitive information.

CVE-2006-0096

    It was discovered that the SDLA driver's capability checks were too lax
    for firmware upgrades.

CVE-2006-0482

    Ludovic Courtes discovered that get_compat_timespec() performs insufficient input
    sanitizing, which allows a local denial of service attack.

CVE-2006-1066

    It was discovered that ptrace() on the ia64 architecture allows a local denial of
    service attack, when preemption is enabled.

The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     Source                      2.6.8-16sarge2
     Alpha architecture          2.6.8-16sarge2
     AMD64 architecture          2.6.8-16sarge2
     HP Precision architecture   2.6.8-6sarge2
     Intel IA-32 architecture    2.6.8-16sarge2
     Intel IA-64 architecture    2.6.8-14sarge2
     Motorola 680x0 architecture 2.6.8-4sarge2
     PowerPC architecture        2.6.8-12sarge2
     IBM S/390 architecture      2.6.8-5sarge2
     Sun Sparc architecture      2.6.8-15sarge2

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatability with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     kernel-latest-2.6-alpha     101sarge1
     kernel-latest-2.6-amd64     103sarge1
     kernel-latest-2.6-hppa      2.6.8-1sarge1
     kernel-latest-2.6-sparc     101sarge1
     kernel-latest-2.6-i386      101sarge1
     kernel-latest-powerpc       102sarge1
     fai-kernels                 1.9.1sarge1
     hostap-modules-i386         0.3.7-1sarge1
     mol-modules-2.6.8           0.9.70+2.6.8+12sarge1
     ndiswrapper-modules-i386    1.1-2sarge1

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

This update introduces a change in the kernel's binary interface, the affected
kernel packages inside Debian have been rebuilt, if you're running local addons
you'll need to rebuild these as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

commit ab1e03b731781609a550360f295061ff57ca3dbb

commit 24eda4e69d4f0a4d5a66c8b5a8fa9b895d832368

[PATCH] Module per-cpu alignment cannot always be met
Fwd from Daniel Drake .
The module code assumes noone will ever ask for a per-cpu area more than
SMP\_CACHE\_BYTES aligned. However, as these cases show, gcc asks sometimes
asks for 32-byte alignment for the per-cpu section on a module, and if
CONFIG\_X86\_L1\_CACHE\_SHIFT is 4, we hit that BUG\_ON(). This is obviously an
unusual combination, as there have been few reports, but better to warn
than die.

[PATCH] CAN-2005-2099 Destruction of failed keyring oopses
The attached patch makes sure that a keyring that failed to instantiate
properly is destroyed without oopsing [CAN-2005-2099].
The problem occurs in three stages:
(1) The key allocator initialises the type-specific data to all zeroes. In
the case of a keyring, this will become a link in the keyring name list
when the keyring is instantiated.
(2) If a user (any user) attempts to add a keyring with anything other than
an empty payload, the keyring instantiation function will fail with an
error and won't add the keyring to the name list.
(3) The keyring's destructor then sees that the keyring has a description
(name) and tries to remove the keyring from the name list, which oopses
because the link pointers are both zero.
This bug permits any user to take down a box trivially.

[PATCH] CAN-2005-2098 Error during attempt to join key management session can leave semaphore pinned
The attached patch prevents an error during the key session joining operation
from hanging future joins in the D state [CAN-2005-2098].
The problem is that the error handling path for the KEYCTL\_JOIN\_SESSION\_KEYRING
operation has one error path that doesn't release the session management
semaphore. Further attempts to get the semaphore will then sleep for ever in
the D state.
This can happen in four situations, all involving an attempt to allocate a new
session keyring:
(1) ENOMEM.
(2) The users key quota being reached.
(3) A keyring name that is an empty string.
(4) A keyring name that is too long.
Any user may attempt this operation, and so any user can cause the problem to
occur.

[PATCH] Check input buffer size in zisofs
Add fakey 'deflateBound()' function to the in-kernel zlib routines
It's not the real deflateBound() in newer zlib libraries, partly because
the upcoming usage of it won't have the "stream" available, so we can't
have the same interfaces anyway.
This uses the new deflateBound() thing to sanity-check the input to the
zlib decompressor before we even bother to start reading in the blocks.

[PATCH] x86\_64: Fixing smpboot timing problem
This patch fixes the SMP boot timing problem that hit various people and was
introduced in 2.6.12. Please apply to stable.
>From Eric Biederman
sync\_tsc was using smp\_call\_function to ask the boot processor
to report it's tsc value. smp\_call\_function performs an IPI\_send\_allbutself
which is a broadcast ipi. There is a window during processor startup during
which the target cpu has started and before it has initialized it's interrupt
vectors so it can properly process an interrupt. Receveing an interrupt
during that window will triple fault the cpu and do other nasty things.
Why cli does not protect us from that is beyond me.
The simple fix is to match ia64 and provide a smp\_call\_function\_single.
Which avoids the broadcast and is more efficient.
This certainly fixes the problem of getting stuck on boot which was
very easy to trigger on my SMP Hyperthreaded Xeon, and I think
it fixes it for the right reasons.

[PATCH] sys\_set\_mempolicy() doesnt check if mode < 0
A kernel BUG() is triggered by a call to set\_mempolicy() with a negative
first argument. This is because the mode is declared as an int, and the
validity check doesnt check < 0 values. Alternatively, mode could be
declared as unsigned int or unsigned long.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
