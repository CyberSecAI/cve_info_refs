- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Quake 2 Lithium mod parses the '%' character in player nicknames as a format string specifier.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Format string vulnerability exists due to the mod interpreting special characters (e.g., '%') in player nicknames as format specifiers, like `%d`, `%c`, etc.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Stack overflow leading to a crash of the Quake 2 server. The attacker is working towards achieving arbitrary code execution and memory read capabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted nickname containing format string specifiers to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to a Quake 2 server running the vulnerable Lithium mod and set their nickname.
