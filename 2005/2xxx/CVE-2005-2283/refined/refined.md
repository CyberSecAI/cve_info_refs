- **Root cause of vulnerability:** WebEOC does not impose size limits on file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of file size validation during upload.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authorized attacker can upload large files that exhaust system resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker uploads large files through the WebEOC web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authorized user of the WebEOC system.
