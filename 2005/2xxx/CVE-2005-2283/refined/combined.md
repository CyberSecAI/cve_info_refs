## WebEOC is vulnerable to a denial-of-service condition via uploading large files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#956762

Original Release Date: 2005-07-13 | Last Revised: 2005-07-20

---

### Overview

WebEOC does not properly impose size limits on files that a user can upload. This may allow a authorized attacker to exhaust system resources leading to a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| WebEOC is a web-based crisis information management application that provides functions to gather, coordinate, and disseminate information between emergency personnel and Emergency Operations Centers (EOC). WebEOC does not restrict the size of files that an authenticated user can upload into a back-end database. Uploading very large files may exhaust system and database resources eventually interrupting the system operations. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authorized attacker may be able to consume a large amount of system resources. As system resources are exhausted, system operation may be disrupted resulting in a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Version 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi:*This vulnerability has been addressed in version 6.0.2 for ASP pages using the file saving mechanism in WebEOC. The file upload mechanism now checks the file size before storing the file data in the database as a binary object, limiting the total amount of data that may be uploaded into WebEOC. In an upcoming version of WebEOC this mitigation technique will be expanded to include other potential vulnerabilities.*To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi [Technical Support](http://www.esi911.com/esi/support/support.htm)*.* |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Restrict access to the WebEOC system to only known and trusted users. |
