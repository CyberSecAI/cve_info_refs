{
  "CVE-2005-2265": {
    "Description": "The `InstallVersion.compareTo()` function in Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Suite does not properly validate the input object type. When passed an object instead of a string, it assumes it's another `InstallVersion` object without verification, leading to a crash due to an access violation. Furthermore, it is possible on some OS versions to control the instruction pointer, which could allow for arbitrary machine code execution if the attacker can load exploit code at a predictable address.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `InstallVersion.compareTo()` function does not validate input object types, leading to type confusion and dereferencing invalid memory.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Type confusion",
      "Missing input validation",
      "Potential for arbitrary code execution"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution by carefully crafting input objects and loading exploit code at a predictable address. This could lead to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted JavaScript object passed to the `InstallVersion.compareTo()` function, typically via a `javascript:` URI.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to get the target browser to execute malicious JavaScript code. The attacker might also need the ability to predict memory addresses."
