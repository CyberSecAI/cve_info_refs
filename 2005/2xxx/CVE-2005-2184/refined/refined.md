The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Documentum eRoom version 6.*. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unrestricted File Uploads & Malicious Shortcut Execution:**
    *   **Root Cause:** eRoom does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of file type validation allows users to upload executable files disguised as shortcuts (.lnk).
    *   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker uploads a malicious .lnk file containing a command to be executed on the victim's system. When a user clicks the shortcut file, the linked command is executed without further user interaction, no pop-ups, or warnings.
    *  **Impact:** Remote code execution on the victim's machine when user clicks the malicious shortcut.
        * Example: The attacker used `cmd.exe /k net user hacker hackerpass /ADD` to add a new user to the victim's machine.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Attacker needs a valid eRoom account to upload a malicious .lnk file.

2.  **Session Cookie Stealing and Replay:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Session cookies do not expire, allowing for replay attacks.
    *   **Weakness:**  Cookies used for authentication do not have timeouts or other protections to prevent replay.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1.  Attacker uploads a malicious HTML file (e.g., `cookie.html`) to eRoom.
        2.  A victim browses the malicious HTML file.
        3.  The HTML file uses JavaScript to send the victim's session cookie to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.
        4.  The attacker replays the stolen cookie to gain unauthorized access to the eRoom site as the victim.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover - An attacker can impersonate a legitimate user and gain access to their information and permissions within eRoom.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:  Attacker needs a valid eRoom account to upload a malicious HTML file and control a server to receive stolen cookies.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides proof-of-concept code for cookie stealing.
*   The advisory mentions the issue might affect all versions of eRoom but can't be verified due to lack of access to a default installation.
*   There are no fixes for version 6.*, and users are advised to update.
