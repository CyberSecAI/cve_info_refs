php security update (RHSA-2006-0276)

Original Release Date: July 5, 2006

Last Revised: February 22, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-129

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

PHP is a general purpose scripting language widely used in World Wide Web
(WWW)pages and applications.

PHP's phpinfo() function was found to contain an issue in how it sanitized
long strings. If an attacker could identify a site using the phpinfo()
call in publicly-available PHP programs, they could possibly use cross-site
scriptings attacks against the site. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-0996](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0996) to this issue.

PHP's html\_entity\_decode() function was discovered not to properly handle
binary content. This could possibly allow a malicious user to disclose the
contents of a certain part of memory. To take advantage of this, an
attacker would have to find a site using the html\_entity\_decode() function
accepting untrusted input from users and showing the results. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-1490](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1490) to this issue.

A bug was found in PHP's error handling output that, under certain
conditions, would not properly escape HTML output. If a site had both the
"display\_errors" and "html\_errors" PHP enabled, an attacker could possibly
take advantage of this vulnerability to use cross-site scripting attacks
against the site. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-0208](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0208) to the issue.

The mb\_send\_mail() function in PHP was found to contain an input validation
issue. Utilizing this bug, an attacker could inject arbitrary e-mail
headers into an email sent by a script calling the mb\_send\_mail() function,
particularly where the "To" e-mail header can be set by the attacker. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2005-3883](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3883) to this issue.

The IMAP server provided by the University of Washington (uw-imap) was found
to contain a buffer overflow vulnerability. As the php-imap package in Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 3 was compiled against the static c-client libraries
from the vulnerable version of uw-imap, php-imap needed to be rebuilt
against the fixed version of uw-imap. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2005-2933](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2933) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0276.html>

php security update (RHSA-2006-0501)

Original Release Date: August 17, 2006

Last Revised: October 10, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-160

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 6.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

PHP is a general purpose scripting language widely used in World Wide Web
(WWW) pages and applications.

The version of PHP and some of the PHP addons shipped with Red Hat Enterprise
Linux version 2.1 were found to contain security vulnerabilities. The
details of these vulnerabilities are described below.

PHP's phpinfo() routine was found not to correctly validate long strings. As
a result, an attacker could possibly use this as an attack vector for
cross-site scripting attacks against websites that provide
publicly-accessible PHP scripts containing the phpinfo() function. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2006-0996](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0996) to this issue.

In select circumstances, the output of PHP's error handling functions was not
properly formatted HTML. Due to this issue, an attacker could possibly use
this as an attack vector for cross-site scripting attacks against web
sites that have enabled the "display\_errors" and "html\_errors" options in
php.ini. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-0208](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0208) to this issue.

The University of Washington's IMAP server (uw-imap) was found to have a
buffer overflow vulnerability. As the php-imap package is built against a
static version of the c-client libraries (provided by uw-imap), php-imap
needed to be rebuilt against a fixed version of the c-client libraries. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2005-2933](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2933) to this issue.

PHP's wordwrap() routine was found to have issues with integer overflow
checking while processing the "break" parameter. An attacker could possibly
cause a heap overflow if they had control over the string passed to the
"break" parameter. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-1990](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1990) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0501.html>

# uw-imap: Remote buffer overflow — GLSA **200510-10**

uw-imap is vulnerable to remote overflow of a buffer in the IMAP server
leading to execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/uw-imap** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2004g** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2004g** |

### Background

uw-imap is the University of Washington's IMAP and POP server
daemons.

### Description

Improper bounds checking of user supplied data while parsing IMAP
mailbox names can lead to overflowing the stack buffer.

### Impact

Successful exploitation requires an authenticated IMAP user to
request a malformed mailbox name. This can lead to execution of
arbitrary code with the permissions of the IMAP server.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All uw-imap users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/uw-imap-2004g"
```

## Synopsis

php security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0276)

## Topic

Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Web server.

The phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. An
attacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks against
sites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo().
(CVE-2006-0996)

The html\_entity\_decode() PHP function was found to not be binary safe. An
attacker could use this flaw to disclose a certain part of the memory. In
order for this issue to be exploitable the target site would need to have a
PHP script which called the "html\_entity\_decode()" function with untrusted
input from the user and displayed the result. (CVE-2006-1490)

The error handling output was found to not properly escape HTML output in
certain cases. An attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site
scripting attacks against sites where both display\_errors and html\_errors
are enabled. (CVE-2006-0208)

An input validation error was found in the "mb\_send\_mail()" function. An
attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary headers in a mail sent via
a script calling the "mb\_send\_mail()" function where the "To" parameter can
be controlled by the attacker. (CVE-2005-3883)

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of
Washington's IMAP Server. php-imap is compiled against the static c-client
libraries from imap and therefore needed to be recompiled against the fixed
version. This issue only affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.
(CVE-2005-2933).

Users of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches that resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

php security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0276)

## Topic

Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Web server.

The phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. An
attacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks against
sites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo().
(CVE-2006-0996)

The html\_entity\_decode() PHP function was found to not be binary safe. An
attacker could use this flaw to disclose a certain part of the memory. In
order for this issue to be exploitable the target site would need to have a
PHP script which called the "html\_entity\_decode()" function with untrusted
input from the user and displayed the result. (CVE-2006-1490)

The error handling output was found to not properly escape HTML output in
certain cases. An attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site
scripting attacks against sites where both display\_errors and html\_errors
are enabled. (CVE-2006-0208)

An input validation error was found in the "mb\_send\_mail()" function. An
attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary headers in a mail sent via
a script calling the "mb\_send\_mail()" function where the "To" parameter can
be controlled by the attacker. (CVE-2005-3883)

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of
Washington's IMAP Server. php-imap is compiled against the static c-client
libraries from imap and therefore needed to be recompiled against the fixed
version. This issue only affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.
(CVE-2005-2933).

Users of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches that resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=178028#c0)  Josh Bressers    2006-01-17 15:11:40 UTC  ``` PHP 5.1.2 has been released: <http://www.php.net/release_5_1_2.php>  The release announcement mentions this security fix:     * Possible cross-site scripting problems in certain error conditions.  The problem exists in the way PHP displays error messages.  This issue is only exploitable when 'display_errors' and 'html_errors' are both set to 'On' in the PHP configuration file.  When a HTML error message was being generated, the output was not properly sanitized, which could allow an attacker to insert arbitrary HTML, thus allowing a XSS attack.  This issue is only exploitable if 'html_errors' is on, which the configuration file cleary states should not be used on production machines.  I have verified this flaw exists in the PHP 4.3 and 5.1 branches.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=178028#c1)  Josh Bressers    2006-01-17 15:42:43 UTC  ``` This issue also affects RHEL3 and RHEL2.1   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=178028#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-04-25 14:28:31 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0276.html>    ``` |  |

## UW-IMAP vulnerable to a buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#933601

Original Release Date: 2005-10-17 | Last Revised: 2005-12-20

---

### Overview

UW-IMAP contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| [The University of Washington IMAP Server](http://www.washington.edu/imap/) (UW-IMAP) is an email server that uses the Internet Message Access Protocol (lMAP). A lack of validation on user-controlled data supplied to the UW-IMAP Server may allow a buffer overflow to occur. The UW-IMAP Server expects mailbox names enclosed with quote characters ("). If a remote attacker supplies the UW-IMAP server with a mailbox name that begins with a quote character but does not have a closing quote character, the server will continue to read data until an end quote character is reached. This may overrun the buffer meant to contain the mailbox name and overwrite the stack with attacker-controlled data. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  This vulnerability is fixed in UW-IMAP maintenance release imap-2004g. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

See the details below for more information.  Also, new Pine packages are provided since these are built together...  why not?  Might as well upgrade that too, while I'm fixing the fake security problem.  :-)   Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/imapd-4.64-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to imapd-4.64.   A buffer overflow was reported in the mail_valid_net_parse_work function.   However, this function in the c-client library does not appear to be called   from anywhere in imapd.  iDefense states that the issue is of LOW risk to   sites that allow users shell access, and LOW-MODERATE risk to other servers.   I believe it's possible that it is of NIL risk if the function is indeed   dead code to imapd, but draw your own conclusions...
