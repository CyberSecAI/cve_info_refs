# USN-184-1: umount vulnerability

19 September 2005

umount vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

David Watson discovered that "umount -r" removed some restrictive

mount options like the "nosuid" flag. If /etc/fstab contains

user-mountable removable devices which specify the "nosuid" flag

(which is common practice for such devices), a local attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary programs with root privileges by

calling "umount -r" on a removable device.

This does not affect the default Ubuntu configuration. Since Ubuntu

mounts removable devices automatically, there is normally no need to

configure them manually in /etc/fstab.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* mount
  -

##### Ubuntu 4.10

* mount
  -

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

util-linux and mount security update (RHSA-2005-782)

Original Release Date: January 16, 2006

Last Revised: January 16, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-014

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The util-linux package contains a large variety of low-level system
utilities that are necessary for a Linux system to function.

The mount package contains the mount, umount, swapon and swapoff
programs.

A bug was found in the way the umount command is executed by normal
users.
It may be possible for a user to gain elevated privileges if the user is
able to execute the "umount -r" command on a mounted file system. The
file system will be re-mounted only with the "readonly" flag set,
clearing
flags such as "nosuid" and "noexec". The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CAN-200
5-2876](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2876) to
this issue.

This update also fixes a hardlink bug in the script command for Red
Hat
Enterprise Linux 2.1. If a local user places a hard linked file named
"typescript" in a directory they have write access to, the file will be
overwritten if the user running script has write permissions to the
destination file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CAN-200
1-1494](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2001-1494) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* [https://rhn.redhat
  .com/errata/RHSA-2005-782.html](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-782.html)

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems. Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the
underlying operating system or applications that come with the operating
system. These vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only
product directly but may threaten the integrity of the underlying
platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform
may be. Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | all | Low | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Please ENTER actions for software
products which use vulnerable versions of util-linux and mount.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support [website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

Package        : loop-aes-utils
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2876

David Watson discoverd a bug in mount as provided by util-linux and
other packages such as loop-aes-utils that allows local users to
bypass filesystem access restrictions by re-mounting it read-only.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain loop-aes-utils
packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12p-4sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12p-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your loop-aes-utils package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
