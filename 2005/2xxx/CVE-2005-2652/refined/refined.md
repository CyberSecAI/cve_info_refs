The provided content describes a vulnerability in Zorum 3.5, specifically a remote code execution vulnerability, and path disclosure.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `prod.php` file where the script uses user-supplied input from the `argv[1]` parameter directly in a `system()` call without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Remote Command Execution:** The `system("mkdir $prodDir/$appDir")` line is vulnerable because `$appDir` is directly taken from the `argv[1]` parameter. By injecting shell metacharacters, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Path Disclosure:** Several other files, like `notification.php`, `user.php`, etc. disclose the full path of the script, which could aid further attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
    *   **Path Disclosure:** Information about the file paths on the system is leaked.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious payload in the `argv[1]` parameter of the `prod.php` script.
    *   **Path Disclosure:** The attacker simply requests the vulnerable scripts like `notification.php` to disclose path information.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and the ability to send HTTP requests.
    *  **Path Disclosure:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and the ability to send HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `/gorum/prod.php` file.
*   The exploit uses the `argv[1]` parameter, and the pipe (`|`) character to inject and execute commands.
*   The exploit example demonstrates how to list directories, view config files, and view system files like `/etc/passwd`.
*   The content includes a PHP exploit script with proxy support for sending the malicious request.
