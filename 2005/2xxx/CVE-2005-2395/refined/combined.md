User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
When connecting to a web server that offers both HTTP Basic authentication and
HTTP Digest authentication, Firefox selects to perform Basic authentication
rather then the more secure Digest authentication scheme. This behavior is in
contrast to RFC 2617 requirement, which describes HTTP authentication:
------------------------------------------------------------
4.6 Weakness Created by Multiple Authentication Schemes
An HTTP/1.1 server may return multiple challenges with a 401
(Authenticate) response, and each challenge may use a different
auth-scheme. A user agent MUST choose to use the strongest auth-
scheme it understands and request credentials from the user based
upon that challenge
------------------------------------------------------------
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup a Web Server to support both Basic and Digest authentication mode in
parallel i.e. IIS server in a windows domain
2. Use firefox to connect to the web-server.
3. send user/pass credentials, when Firefox prompts the for credentials.
4. Use a network sniffer to to track traffic.
5. analyze sniffer dump, note that Firefox sends the user's credential to the
wb-server, specifying HTTP Basic scheme.
Actual Results:
from network sniffer:

(In reply to [comment #2](/show_bug.cgi?id=281851#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - CVE-2005-2395 Wrong scheme used when server offers both Basic and Digest auth [rfc2617 obsoletes rfc2068]"))
> So the problem seems to be that nsHttpChannel::GetCredentials will go with the

Yes. Mozilla follows the older RFC 2068 (HTTP 1.1 RFC)
"An HTTP/1.1 server may return multiple challenges with a 401
(Authenticate) response, and each challenge may use a different
scheme. The order of the challenges returned to the user agent is in
the order that the server would prefer they be chosen. The server
should order its challenges with the "most secure" authentication
scheme first. A user agent should choose as the challenge to be made
to the user the first one that the user agent understands."
Does IIS always return Digest AFTER Basic authentication in the WWW-Authenticate
headers or did that take some hacking of the Metabase? What browers are smart
enough to handle this correctly?
Valid RFE, probably not security sensitive.

> Yes. Mozilla follows the older RFC 2068 (HTTP 1.1 RFC)
IMHO it should follow the more secure option manadated in RFC 2617, which
obsoletes RFC 2068
> Does IIS always return Digest AFTER Basic authentication in the WWW-
Authenticate headers or did that take some hacking of the Metabase?
This is the default behavior of IIS 5.0 I was told IIS 6.0 places digest first
by I didn't verify.
>What browers are smart enough to handle this correctly?
Seen the same problem with IE 6.

Attached patch

[version 0.1](attachment.cgi?id=195675&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=195675&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=281851&attachment=195675)

I made this patch in an attempt to learn a bit more about array and string
usage in the Mozilla API, and I hope I can get some help to evolve the patch
into something that resembles proper usage ... If you'd like to do that via.
e-mail or IRC, I'd be happy to do so instead.
Anyway, some things I'm not happy about:
\* The "static" priority array should probably live in some longer-lived object;
maybe the HttpHandler?
\* The "static" priority array could be a string list pref, like
'networking.http.auth.schemePriorityList' with a comma-seperated, prioritized
from 0->X, list. Or something ... The idea is that if someone (say, Netscape
:-) makes 2-3 new HTTP authentication schemes and they want one of them to have
a priority between basic and digest, they can easily just modify this pref. As
it is now, all unknown schemes get a random priority higher than the known
ones.
\* challengesList and schemeList is really just a map of scheme <->
fullChallengeString. I have no idea if there is a better way of doing this ...
\* The strings here are just insane. Why do I have to go through all that
trouble (nsDependentCString(nsCString->get())) when I want to check
nsCStringArray.IndexOf? According to common sense I should be able to just pass
in a nsCString to IndexOf, since it is a CStringArray ... Of course, that
'common sense' is there to fill the void that is my knowledge of the Mozilla
String API and C strings in general :-)

I don't see any comments from Darin here, but out of band I think he told me we
still follow the old spec for server compatibility. Possibly enough servers we
care about have evolved since that time that we can fix it.

I'm not sure what to think about this bug. It's possible that Digest
authentication can be more secure than NTLM, or vice versa, depending on what
mode of NTLM the server supports. In that case, what should we do? I really
prefer giving servers the choice here since it gives "smart" server admins the
flexibility to do what's best for users. However, I understand that it would be
wise for Firefox to prefer Digest auth to Basic auth even if the server lists
Basic auth first.
At first glance, the patch looks pretty good. I'll probably have more comments
once I look it over more closely.
Given that IE also implements the older RFC, it makes it a bit more risky to
consider changing our behavior at this point in time. What about Opera and
Safari? What do they do?

The I.E. I have access to here is version 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp\_sp2\_gdr.050301-1519
(IE6, WinXP SP2), and it chooses basic auth on
<<http://www.security.nnov.ru/files/atest/all.asp>> (which is where, according to
<<http://securityfocus.com/archive/1/410580/30/0/threaded>>, I.E. "offers
strongest authentication".)
So it would seem to me that
<<http://securityfocus.com/archive/1/410580/30/0/threaded>> is wrong and [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=281851#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - CVE-2005-2395 Wrong scheme used when server offers both Basic and Digest auth [rfc2617 obsoletes rfc2068]")

IIS and other servers will probably always offer NTLM before Digest because of
the autosend abilities of IE and Mozilla in Windows. So whether we let mozilla
decide or the server decide the result will probably be the same.

Opera 8.5 build 7700 on Windows selects Basic, just like IE and Mozilla
currently does without [attachment 197260](/attachment.cgi?id=197260 "version 0.2") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=197260&action=edit "version 0.2") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=197260&action=diff "version 0.2") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=281851&attachment=197260).
It might be worth noting that neither IE nor Opera present other authentication
methods if you click Cancel in the Basic dialog. Mozilla presents one dialog for
every auth scheme in sequence where applicable.

I don't have access to Safari, but tried Konqueror, and it presented me with a
user/password dialog that said "Site: NTLM at www.security.nnov.ru", so it would
seem that it uses the (presumed) strongest method by default.
gandalf tested it too, and it said "testdigest@security.nnov.ru at
www.security.nnov.ru" there, so I presume NTLM is for some reason disabled in
his build, but it picked digest over basic.
Clicking Cancel did not provoke an auth dialog for a "lesser" scheme (like
Mozilla does).

Since Firefox cannot know if NTLM is better than Digest or vice versa, I think Firefox should simply prefer anything over Basic authentication. When deciding between other authentication schemes, Firefox should just select them in the order specified by the server. (Negotiate does not necessarily mean Kerberos!)

I agree. This means, AFAICS, that [attachment 197260](/attachment.cgi?id=197260 "version 0.2") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=197260&action=edit "version 0.2") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=197260&action=diff "version 0.2") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=281851&attachment=197260) can be used as attached except changing the pref network.http.auth-scheme-priority-list to read only "basic" and only adding schemePriorityList.AppendCString(NS\_LITERAL\_CSTRING("basic")).

This is an alternate patch that only implements re-ording "basic" auth challenges. It attempts to do the right thing if given multiple basic auth challenges. I haven't fully tested this patch, so any help testing it would be greatly appreciated. The patch includes some cleanup and simplification of some related code.

v1 patch
My testing shows that the patch presents me with other schemes before "basic" in the order specified by the server.
Would it be an idea to keep the pref as proposed in [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=281851#c22 "RESOLVED FIXED - CVE-2005-2395 Wrong scheme used when server offers both Basic and Digest auth [rfc2617 obsoletes rfc2068]")?
It would make it easier to make policy changes at a later date, and also for embedders to make their own decision.
I'm not saying I see an absolute need for it, but I don't see any drawbacks either.

While "Negotiate" does not necessarily absolutely mean "Kerberos", in almost
all practical cases in use today, it almost always means something stronger than
"Basic". Microsoft uses Negotiate to choose between NTLM and Kerberos.
I think it \*is\* safe to put Basic behind Negotiate when sorting by security.
We ran into a problem just recently where an Apache server was sending
"Negotiate" followed by "Basic" and the browser always prompts for Basic,
ignoring the "Negotiate" extension which was the opposite of what was intended -
which was to use Negotiate if possible, else fall back to Basic.
For the rare case where someone might prefer Basic over other choices, use
the preference option, but I think the default should be that Basic is
always used as a last resort.

For unrelated reasons I did some recent testing on how Firefox implements several aspects of RFC 2617, including the one reported by this bug (which I wasn't aware of when I did my testing). I found a number of issues, and while searching Bugzilla found this entry. In addition to this bug, I also found a few other problems.
RFC 2616 section 14.47 specifies the WWW-Authenticate header as follows:
WWW-Authenticate = "WWW-Authenticate" ":" 1#challenge
According to section 2.1, this syntax specifies that WWW-Authenticate contains one or more comma-separated "challenge" elements, and "challenge" gets defined in RFC 2617.
RFC 2617 section 1.2 defines the "challenge" element as follows:
challenge = auth-scheme 1\*SP 1#auth-param
In other words, the "challenge" elements consists of "auth-scheme" (which gets defined as word) one or more spaces, then one or more parameters (defined, roughly, as name=value tuples, elsewhere).
As I interpret this, RFC 2616 and RFC 2617 permit a single WWW-Authenticate header to specify multiple challenges, and the following header seems legal to me, according to RFC 2616 and RFC 2617:
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Test Realm", Digest realm="Test Realm", algorithm=MD5, domain="/", nonce="1350785623", qop="auth"
The fact that this is a valid header is unambiguously confirmed by section 1.2 of RFC 2617:
Note: User agents will need to take special care in parsing the WWW-
Authenticate or Proxy-Authenticate header field value if it contains
more than one challenge, or if more than one WWW-Authenticate header
field is provided, since the contents of a challenge may itself
contain a comma-separated list of authentication parameters.
In my testing, I've set up a test server and pointed Firefox 16.0.1 to it. When Firefox received a response with the above header, it prompted for authentication, but responded with a Basic authentication scheme.
If I reverse the order of the schemes, and have the custom server respond with the following header:
WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="Test Realm", algorithm=MD5, domain="/", nonce="1350785798", qop="auth", Basic realm="Test Realm"
In this case, Firefox fails to prompt for authentication entirely.
I also tested the Elinks 0.12 browser. In both of the above cases, elinks prompted for authentication and responded with the MD5 Digest authorization scheme.
Additional testing:
RFC 2617 specifies only MD5 as the hash mechanism for the Digest authorization scheme, however RFC2617 does not prohibit other schemes from being used. Section 3.2.1 of RFC 2617 states:
algorithm
A string indicating a pair of algorithms used to produce the digest
and a checksum. If this is not present it is assumed to be "MD5".
If the algorithm is not understood, the challenge should be ignored
(and a different one used, if there is more than one).
I am using gcrypt, and it was fairly trivial for me to implement Digest using SHA1, or any other hash method implemented in gcrypt, in place of MD5. So I tried the following headers:
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Test Realm", Digest realm="Test Realm", algorithm=MD5, domain="/", nonce="1350787263", qop="auth", Digest realm="Test Realm", algorithm=SHA1, domain="/", nonce="1350787263", qop="auth"
... and several other permutations. The results were fairly consistent: Firefox uses Basic authorization scheme if it's the first one that appears in the WWW-Authenticate header. If something else appears, even Digest/MD5, which Firefox otherwise implements, Firefox fails to authenticate. Elinks always used Digest/MD5, no matter what its position was, in the header, ignoring the SHA1 challenge.
When I change the server to use a separate WWW-Authenticate header for each challenge, Firefox actually ignores the header with the SHA1 scheme, if it's the first one, and picks either Digest/MD5 or Basic, whichever one sees first, consistent with this bug report.
WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="Test Realm", algorithm=SHA1, domain="/", nonce="1350787799", qop="auth"
WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="Test Realm", algorithm=MD5, domain="/", nonce="1350787799", qop="auth"
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Test Realm"
In this case, Firefox responds with a Digest authorization scheme, and ignores the SHA1 header. When the order is SHA1/Basic/MD5, Firefox uses Basic.
In this respect, Firefox's behavior is the same as Elinks'.

Any idea if this is going to be fixed in Firefox?, or we just want to keep the original behaviour?

I am still seeing Firefox choosing to use Basic auth, when it's offered first before the preferable NTLM and Negotiate options. Any prospect of this ever being fixed?

I have the same problem.
In my case, Users must be authenticated to Squid, to have access to internet.
IE and Chrome choose negotiate over basic, firefox not. (In Squid logs, i found that firefox tries Basic and negotiate at the same time).
There is any solution to force firefox to choose negotiate over basic.
This is my squid config :
### basic authentication
auth\_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic\_ncsa\_auth /etc/squid3/users
auth\_param basic children 5
auth\_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server
auth\_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours
### negotiate kerberos and ntlm authentication
auth\_param negotiate program /usr/local/bin/negotiate\_wrapper -d --ntlm /usr/bin/ntlm\_auth --diagnostics --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp --domain=??????.COM --kerberos /usr/lib/squid$
auth\_param negotiate children 10
auth\_param negotiate keep\_alive off
### pure ntlm authentication
auth\_param ntlm program /usr/bin/ntlm\_auth --diagnostics --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp --domain=??????.COM
auth\_param ntlm children 10
auth\_param ntlm keep\_alive off

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Dear bugTraq,
I have reported this issue some time ago:
http://www.security.nnov.ru/Fnews19.html
but it looks like it was ignored, and not fixed in latest mozilla and
firefox releases, so I decided to send "formal" advisory
Issue: Mozilla browsers authentication weakness
Author: 3APA3A <3APA3A (at) security.nnov (dot) ru [email concealed]>
Advisory URL: http://www.security.nnov.ru/Fnews19.html
Vendor: Mozilla (http://www.mozilla.org)
Products: Mozilla 1.7.11 (Windows version tested)
FireFox 1.0.6 (Windows version tested)
Type: Man-in-the-Middle, information leak
Exploit: Not required
I. Intro
RFC 2617 defines Authentication mechanism for HTTP protocol. Any web
browser implement this standard for web site access authentication.
II. Vulnerability
Firefox and Mozilla browser have vulnerability in authentication
mechanism implementation. Potential impact of this vulnerability is
weak authentication protocol (for example cleartext) may be chosen for
Web site authentication instead of stronger one.
III. Details
From RFC 2617:
The user agent MUST
choose to use one of the challenges with the strongest auth-scheme it
understands and request credentials from the user based upon that
challenge.
Instead, Mozilla uses authentication schemas in the order of
WWW-Authenticate headers sent by Web server. It may lead to situation
weak authentication (for example cleartext "Basic" authentication) may
be chosen by Mozilla while both server and Mozilla support stronger
authentication mechanism.
IV. Demonstration
This links demonstrate initial handshake for different authentication
protocols:
http://www.security.nnov.ru/files/atest/basic.asp - Basic authentication
http://www.security.nnov.ru/files/atest/digest.asp - Digest authentication
http://www.security.nnov.ru/files/atest/ntlm.asp - NTLM authentication
http://www.security.nnov.ru/files/atest/negotiate.asp - Negotiate authentication
With this link you can check which protocol was chosen by browser, if
server support few authentication protocols:
http://www.security.nnov.ru/files/atest/all.asp
For Mozilla/Firefox "Basic" authentication with cleartext login/password
transmitted over the wire will be chosen by default. By pressing
"Cancel" you can choose different authentication. Internet Explorer
offers strongest authentication.
