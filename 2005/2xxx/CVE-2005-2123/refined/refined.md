  "CVE-2005-2123": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Content": "The provided content contains information related to CVE-2005-2123.",
      "Source": "Multiple sources"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "An unchecked buffer in the rendering of Windows Metafile (WMF) and Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image formats.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. It could also be used for local privilege escalation or remote denial of service.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted file (WMF/EMF image).",
        "Viewing a folder containing a malicious image.",
        "Visiting a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer.",
        "Viewing an HTML email with a specially crafted image attachment via Outlook or Outlook Express.",
         "Opening a specially crafted image embedded in an Office document.",
        "Local exploitation by running a specially-designed program after logging onto the system.",
        "Accessing the component through other vectors such as another program passing parameters to it."
       ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Ability to create a specially crafted WMF/EMF image.",
        "Ability to deliver the image to a target (e.g. via email, website, file share, local storage, or other program that uses the vulnerable component)."
      ]
    },
    "Additional Information": {
       "Affected Systems": "Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP1/SP2, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003/SP1, Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems/SP1, and Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition are all vulnerable.",
       "Mitigation": "The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who persuaded a user to open a specially crafted file or to view a folder that contains the specially crafted image. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a malicious file, except potentially through previewing an email message.",
        "Workaround": "Reading e-mail messages in plain text format can mitigate the HTML e-mail attack vector by preventing the rendering of malicious images. However, this disables pictures and rich content."
