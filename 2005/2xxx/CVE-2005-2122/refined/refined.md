Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2005-2122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Windows Shell handles certain properties of `.lnk` (shortcut) files. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when Windows processes a malformed .lnk file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of .lnk file properties, specifically, the way Windows processes malformed .lnk file properties before passing them to allocated buffers.
-  The vulnerability is triggered when Windows attempts to display properties of shortcut files, or opens a malformed .lnk file with specially crafted properties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Complete System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of the system with the same privileges as the user opening the malicious file (if an administrator opens the file, the attacker could gain administrative privileges). This includes:
    - Installing programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction.
    - **Opening a malicious .lnk file:** An attacker can persuade a user to open a specially crafted .lnk file, typically through email attachments or by hosting the file on a website and tricking the user into downloading/opening it.
    - **Viewing properties of a malicious .lnk file:** An attacker can trick a user to view the properties of a specially crafted .lnk file.
- **Local Access:** An attacker with valid logon credentials could also exploit the vulnerability locally by logging on and opening the malicious file.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker can host a website with a malicious .lnk file that prompts the user to perform an action (e.g. downloading or opening a malicious file) when visiting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to create a specially crafted .lnk file.
- Ability to deliver the malicious .lnk file to the target user. This could be via:
    - Email attachments
    - Hosting on a malicious web server
    - Direct access to the target system (local exploitation).
- The attacker needs to persuade the user to open or preview the crafted .lnk file.
