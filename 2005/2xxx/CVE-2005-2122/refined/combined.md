How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly-discovered, privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own "Vulnerability Details" section.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

We recommend that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 2000 | Windows XP Service Pack 1 | Windows XP Service Pack 2 | Windows Server 2003 | Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shell Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-2122](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-2122) | Remote Code Execution\ | Important\ | Important\ | Important\ | Important\ | Important\ |
| Shell Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-2118](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-2118) | Remote Code Execution\ | Important\ | Important\ | None\ | None\ | None\ |
| Web View Script Injection Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-2117](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-2117) | Remote Code Execution\ | Moderate\ | None\ | None\ | None\ | None\ |
| **Aggregate Severity of All Vulnerabilities** | **Important**\ | **Important**\ | **Important**\ | **Important**\ | **Important**\ |  |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The severity ratings for non-x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating systems versions as follows:

* The Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows XP Service Pack 2 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces several prior security bulletins. The security bulletin IDs and operating systems that are affected are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Windows 2000 | Windows XP (All versions) | Windows Server 2003 | Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS05-016**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=43001) | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced | Not Applicable |
| [**MS05-024**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=44361) | Replaced | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Not Applicable |

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 ended on June 30, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a ended on December 31, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 ended on June 30, 2005. I am still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 have reached the end of their life cycles. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require additional *custom support for these products* must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers.

**Security update support for Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

With the release of Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) will no longer receive security update support. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. Microsoft will continue to fully support Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based systems, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions for 64-bit computing requirements. Microsoft continues to license and support Windows Server 2003 Enterprise and Datacenter editions for Itanium-based systems, and the 64-bit version of SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition. In the future, we will expand Itanium support to Visual Studio 2005, .NET Framework 2005, and SQL Server 2005.

Customers who require additional assistance about this issue must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for information about the available migration options.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Shell Vulnerability- CAN-2005-2122:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows because of the way that it handles the .lnk file name extension. By persuading a user to open an .lnk file that has specially-crafted properties an attacker could execute code on an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Shell Vulnerability- CAN-2005-2122:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform an action. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* To exploit this vulnerability locally the attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

#### Workarounds for Shell Vulnerability- CAN-2005-2122:

Do not open files that have .lnk extensions and that come from unknown or untrusted sources.

After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform an action. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful through e-mail a user must save an attachment locally and then preview it in Windows Explorer.

#### Workarounds for Web View Script Injection Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2117:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable Web View:**

  Disabling Web View will reduce the ability to maliciously use this feature to perform an attack. To disable Web View, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **My Computer.**
  2. Click **Tools** menu, and then click **Folder Options**.
  3. On the **General tab,** under **Tasks**, click **Use Windows classic folders**, and then click **OK.**

  These settings take affect only after you log off the system and then log back on again.

  **Impact of Workaround:** This change will reduce the functionality of Windows Explorer by removing the left hand task pane which contains links to common folders and tasks.
* **Use the Group Policy settings to disable Web View on all affected systems that do not require this feature:**

  Disabling Web View will reduce the ability to maliciously use this feature to perform an attack.

  For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Web sites:

  + [Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding the Group Policy Feature Set](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/stepbystep/gpfeat.mspx)
  + [Windows 2000 Group Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/howto/grpolwt.mspx)

  **Impact of Workaround:** This change will reduce the functionality of Windows Explorer by removing the task pane, which contains links to common folders and tasks.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the perimeter firewall:**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection by using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Blocking outbound SMB traffic at the perimeter firewall will help prevent systems from trying to connect to a malicious file server outside the firewall. For more information about the ports, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of Workaround:** Computers that are behind the firewall will be unable to access trusted file servers by using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol outside the network.

#### FAQ for Web View Script Injection Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2117:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. By persuading a user to preview a malicious file, an attacker could execute code. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process that Windows Explorer uses to validate HTML characters in certain document fields when in Web View.

**What is Web View?**

Web View is one of two formats that Windows Explorer provides to view file and folder information. This feature allows a user to preview a file or folder in a thumbnail view before they open it. Web View also displays information about that file or folder, such as the title and the author.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a malicious file and placing it in a local or remote location. The attacker would then have to persuade a user to connect to the folder in Windows Explorer and preview the document. The document could then cause the affected system to execute code.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows Explorer validates HTML characters in certain file fields.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

Arpidfix.exe is used by the security update installer to address an issue documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 904630](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/904630). This file is not installed onto the affected system.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key.

  Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP2\KB900725\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 900725 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows XP (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

This security update requires Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1 or a later version. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 322389](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389).

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**

The update for this issue will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |

| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951). For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:

**Windows2000-kb900725-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB900725.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:

**Windows2000-kb900725-x86-enu /norestart**

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB900725\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 900725 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Windows Shell fails to handle shortcut files properly

#### Vulnerability Note VU#922708

Original Release Date: 2005-10-11 | Last Revised: 2005-10-11

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows Shell does not properly handle some shortcut files and may permit arbitrary code execution when a specially-crafted file is opened.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows supports files that point to another file, called "shortcut" files. These files have the .lnk extension, and may have properties that are passed to the target program or file.  Windows does not properly handle some properties on shortcut files and may be vulnerable to a specially-crafted shortcut file format. An attacker that has crafted such a shortcut file and that has convinced a user to open the file may be able to execute arbitrary code on the system. This file may be opened from an email message or a web link.The arbitrary code is executed with the user's privileges, so if an administrative user has opened the file, the attacker may be able to take complete control of the system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code and take complete control of the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Please see [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-049](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-049.mspx) for more information on fixes, workarounds, and updates. |
