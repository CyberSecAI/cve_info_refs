- **Root cause of vulnerability:** WebEOC bases privileges and roles on client-side resources. The system assumes that if a user can navigate to a specific resource via URI, they are authorized to use it and obtain all associated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Client-side authorization leads to privilege escalation. The application trusts client-side requests without server-side validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain elevated privileges, accessing sensitive information and resources.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URI to directly access a resource, an attacker can bypass intended authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URI to access specific resources.
