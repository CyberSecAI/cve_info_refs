## WebEOC privileges are based on client-side authorization

#### Vulnerability Note VU#258834

Original Release Date: 2005-07-13 | Last Revised: 2005-07-20

---

### Overview

WebEOC ties privileges and roles to client-side resources. If an attacker can access a resource directly, that attacker will be granted all the privileges associated with that resource.

### Description

| WebEOC is a web-based crisis information management application that provides functions to gather, coordinate, and disseminate information between emergency personnel and emergency operations centers (EOC). WebEOC privileges and authorizations are granted to a user based on the resources they are accessing. It is assumed that if a user can navigate to a specific resource, then that user is authorized to use that resource and obtain all privileges associated with it. In numerous places in a WebEOC system, resources are requested via URIs. An attacker may be able exploit this design by crafting a URI that will directly access a resource, thus elevating that attacker's privileges. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers may be able to gain elevated privileges giving them access to sensitive information and resources. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Version 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi:*In version 6.0.2 this vulnerability has been addressed by adding validation checks to all function calls submitted to the web server. Any resource request sent to the WebEOC application is validated at the server to ensure that the user is logged in and has the proper permissions.*To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi [Technical Support](http://www.esi911.com/esi/support/support.htm)*.* |
