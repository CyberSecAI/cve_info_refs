## WebEOC implements weak algorithms to encrypt sensitive information

#### Vulnerability Note VU#491770

Original Release Date: 2005-07-13 | Last Revised: 2005-07-14

---

### Overview

WebEOC uses weak cryptographic algorithms to encrypt sensitive information.

### Description

| WebEOC is a web-based crisis information management application that provides functions to gather, coordinate, and disseminate information between emergency personnel and Emergency Operations Centers (EOC). WebEOC uses weak algorithms to encrypt sensitive information. The prerequisite information and effort needed to crack the encryption depends on the algorithm being attacked. However, for a skilled attacker, compromising the crypto-system may still a trivial task. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could recover or derive a private encryption keys, or apply simple cryptanalytic techniques to decipher an encrypted message. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Version 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi:*This vulnerability is addressed in 6.0.2 by hashing passwords (using SHA-512) rather than encrypting them.*To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi [Technical Support](http://www.esi911.com/esi/support/support.htm)*.* |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Restrict access to the WebEOC login pages to only known and trusted users. |
