- **Root cause of vulnerability**: WebEOC uses weak cryptographic algorithms to encrypt sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could recover or derive private encryption keys, or apply simple cryptanalytic techniques to decipher an encrypted message.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A skilled attacker with the ability to analyze the crypto-system.
