Versions affected: stable versions up through 0.1.0.13 and experimental
versions up through 0.1.1.4-alpha.

Impact: Tor clients can completely lose anonymity, confidentiality,
and data integrity if the first Tor server in their path is malicious.
Specifically, if the Tor client chooses a malicious Tor server for
her first hop in the circuit, that server can learn all the keys she
negotiates for the rest of the circuit (or just spoof the whole circuit),
and then read and/or modify all her traffic over that circuit.

Solution: upgrade to at least Tor 0.1.0.14 or 0.1.1.5-alpha.

The details:

In Tor, clients negotiate a separate ephemeral DH handshake with each
server in the circuit, such that no single server (Bob) in the circuit
can know both the client (Alice) and her destinations. The DH handshake
is as follows. (See [1,2] for full details.)

Alice -> Bob: E_{Bob}(g^x)
Bob -> Alice: g^y, H(K)

Encrypting g^x to Bob's public key ensures that only Bob can learn g^x,
so only Bob can generate a K=g^{xy} that Alice will accept. (Alice, of
course, has no need to authenticate herself.)

The problem is that certain weak keys are unsafe for DH handshakes:

Alice -> Mallory: E_{Bob}(g^x)
Mallory -> Bob:   E_{Bob}(g^0)
Bob -> Mallory:   g^y, H(1^y)
Mallory -> Alice: g^0, H(1^y)

Now Alice and Bob have agreed on K=1 and they're both happy. In fact,
we can simplify the attack:

Alice -> Mallory: E_{Bob}(g^x)
Mallory -> Alice: g^0, H(1)

As far as we can tell, there are two classes of weak keys. The first class
(0, 1, p-1=-1) works great in the above attack. The new versions of Tor
thus refuse handshakes involving these keys, as well as keys < 0 and >= p.

The second class of weak keys are ones that allow Mallory to solve for y
given g^y and some guessed plaintext. These are rumored to exist when the
key has only one bit set [3]. But in Tor's case, Mallory does not know
g^x, so nothing she can say to Alice will be acceptable. Thus, we believe
Tor's handshake is not vulnerable to this second class of weak keys.

Nonetheless, we refuse those keys too. The current Tor release refuses
all keys with less than 16 "0" bits set, with less than 16 "1" bits set,
with values less than 2**24, and with values more than p - 2**24. This
is a trivial piece of the overall keyspace, and might help with next
year's weak key discoveries too.

Yay full disclosure,
--Roger

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
