```
Root cause of vulnerability: The ARC archive program creates temporary files with insecure permissions.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure temporary file creation with world-readable permissions.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information from the temporary file, which is used during archive creation.
Attack vectors: Local access.
Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to have local access to the system to read the world-readable temporary file.
