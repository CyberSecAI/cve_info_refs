Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2005-2428:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a default configuration issue in IBM Lotus Domino, specifically concerning how user information is displayed in the Public Address Book (names.nsf database). By default, this database is readable by all users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information, including password hashes, through hidden HTML fields.
*   **Unsalted Password Hashes:** Lotus Domino's password hashing algorithm does not use a salt, meaning the same password always produces the same hash. This makes rainbow table attacks and pre-computed hash databases more effective.
*   **Default Readable Database:** The names.nsf database is by default readable by all users, allowing access to this sensitive information.
*   **Hidden Fields:** Although the fields containing sensitive data like the password hash are not displayed to the user, they are still present in the HTML source of the page as hidden fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Compromise:** Attackers can extract password hashes of users and attempt to crack them, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Information Gathering:** Attackers can gather other sensitive configuration information such as password change dates, client platform information, client machine names, and Lotus Domino release versions. This information can be used to launch further targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of Lotus Domino WebMail.
*   **Direct Database Access:** Users can directly access the Public Address Book (`names.nsf`) and view person entries through a web browser.
*   **HTML Source Inspection:** Attackers can access the sensitive data by viewing the source code of the web page and extracting the data from hidden fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the Lotus Domino server.
*   **Basic Web Access:** Attackers require access to a web browser to view the source code of the Lotus Domino web interface.
*   **No Special Privileges:** No specific privileges are required to access the Public Address Book (names.nsf) in its default configuration.
