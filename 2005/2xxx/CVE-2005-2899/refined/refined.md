The provided content describes a vulnerability affecting multiple Cj Design applications: CjTagBoard 3.0, CjLinkOut 1.0, and CjWeb2Mail 3.0. It details cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities present in these applications.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the applications. Specifically, user-supplied input through HTTP GET parameters is directly included in the HTML output without encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. These are present in multiple input fields of the affected applications, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they visit the affected page. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities including:
*   Session hijacking (cookie theft).
*   Defacement of the web page.
*   Redirection to malicious sites.
*   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript code embedded in specific parameters. The examples show how to inject script tags into vulnerable parameters such as `date`, `time`, `name`, `ip`, `agent`, and `msg` in CjTagBoard; `123` in CjLinkOut; and `name`, `message`, `ip`, and `emsg` in CjWeb2Mail.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs to be able to craft malicious URLs. The target user must then access this malicious URL via their browser to be affected by the injected code. The attacker can be remote and does not require any special position on the network or within the system.
