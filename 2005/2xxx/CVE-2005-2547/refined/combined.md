How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : bluez-utils
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2547
Debian Bug     : 323365

Henryk Plötz discovered a vulnerability n bluez-utils, tools and
daemons for Bluetooth.  Due to missing input sanitising it is possible
for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands supplied as device name
from the remote device.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem
since it doesn't contain bluez-utils packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.15-1.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.19-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your bluez-utils package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Henryk Plötz    2005-08-06 10:10:46 UTC  ``` There is a security vulnerability in bluez-utils 2.16 through 2.18 (I only tested 2.18, but the CVS logs indicate that the problem exists at least since 2.16) which allows for remote command execution (over the air) with root privileges and bypassing of the Bluetooth PIN.  The vulnerability occurs when the pin helper is called and thus exists only when "security user" is set in hcid.conf (which is the default in Gentoo Linux, but not in the upstream package). The attacker also needs to get his device name into the device name cache and I'm not sure how to do this in general so it might be harder to exploit in a default installation.   However, upstream has released a fixed bluez-utils-2.19 (which also needs bluez-libs-2.19, unfortunately) and I think Gentoo include this version ASAP. Should this not be possible then at least the existing version ought to be patched. The difference between the vulnerable and the non-vulnerable version is: <http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/bluez/utils/hcid/security.c?r1=1.31&r2=1.34>  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-06 11:45:28 UTC  ``` liquidx or mobile/pda herds: please apply patch or bump to 2.19 ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Henrik Brix Andersen    2005-08-08 10:19:43 UTC  ``` liquidx: are you around to handle this? If I do not hear from you by tomorrow, I will handle the bump so we can get it marked stable on all affected archs. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Henrik Brix Andersen    2005-08-09 11:59:23 UTC  ``` I have added net-wireless/bluez-libs-2.19 and net-wireless/bluez-utils-2.19, which address the issue of this bug report.  I will mark them stable on x86 tomorrow if no additional bug reports tick in. Other archs: please follow. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-10 00:55:52 UTC  ``` I asked for a CAN number to MITRE. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Henrik Brix Andersen    2005-08-10 03:49:03 UTC  ``` Stable on x86. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-10 08:09:24 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-12 00:25:02 UTC  ``` ====================================================== Candidate: CAN-2005-2547 URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2547> Reference: MLIST:[bluez-devel] 20050804 Possible security vulnerability in hcid when calling pin helper Reference: URL:<http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7893206&forum_id=1881> Reference: CONFIRM:[https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101557](show_bug.cgi?id=101557 "RESOLVED FIXED - net-wireless/bluez-utils<= 2.19 security vulnerability") Reference: CONFIRM:<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/bluez/utils/hcid/security.c?r1=1.31&r2=1.34>  security.c in hcid for BlueZ 2.18 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the Bluetooth device name when invoking the PIN helper. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Carlos Silva (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-12 03:56:21 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Henrik Brix Andersen    2005-08-12 04:06:17 UTC  ``` What about hppa? ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-12 08:22:00 UTC  ``` You're right, we missed hppa. hppa, sparc : please test and mark stable. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Michael Hanselmann (hansmi) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-13 00:33:13 UTC  ``` Stable on hppa. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-15 09:47:58 UTC  ``` sparc please test and mark stable ASAP, thx.  ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-17 06:14:29 UTC  ``` sparc stable. didn't get the chance to properly test it, but it should be fine, hopefully i'll get the bt kit by this weekend, play with it and leave it be or mask it.  ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-17 09:43:15 UTC  ``` GLSA 200508-09  ``` |  |
