  "CVE-2005-2117": {
    "status": "RELEVANT",
    "cve_description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Web View in Windows Explorer handles certain HTML characters in preview fields. By persuading a user to preview a malicious file, an attacker could execute code. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Windows Explorer's Web View validates HTML characters within certain document fields when displaying previews.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of HTML characters in preview fields within Web View.",
        "Script injection vulnerability in Windows Explorer's Web View feature."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, potentially granting the attacker the same user rights as the local user. In the case of administrative users, complete system control could be compromised.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker crafts a malicious file with HTML characters to exploit the vulnerability.",
         "An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform an action." ,
        "Persuading a user to preview this malicious file through Windows Explorer."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to preview a specially crafted malicious file. This requires user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.",
      "affected_systems": [
          "Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4"
          ]
    },
    "workarounds": [
      "Disable Web View.",
      "Use Group Policy settings to disable Web View.",
      "Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the perimeter firewall."
      ]
