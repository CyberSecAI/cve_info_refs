{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A memory leak in the worker MPM of the Apache HTTP Server occurs when handling aborted connections. The memory used for the transaction pool is not freed, leading to memory exhaustion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by repeatedly sending requests that are then aborted, leading to memory exhaustion on the server. This prevents the server from handling legitimate connections.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network connections"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to establish network connections to the vulnerable server and trigger the abort condition."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_components": [
      "Apache HTTP Server worker MPM"
    ],
    "affected_configurations": "This vulnerability only affects users using the non-default 'worker' Multi-Processing Module (MPM) in Apache HTTP Server.",
     "vulnerability_severity": "Moderate",
     "exploitation_complexity": "Exploiting the memory leak requires a specific sequence of events to trigger a race condition. This vulnerability is not easily exploitable, and the impact is lower due to the use of a non-default MPM and the race condition.  The DoS impact is also limited as a crash only occurs when using the non-default worker MPM."
