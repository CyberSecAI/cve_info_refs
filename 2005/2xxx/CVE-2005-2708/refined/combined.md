How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Firstly, the test program is irrelevant.  On RHEL3 U4, the following command takes the code path in question (altered by the patch above):    bash -c 'ulimit -v 100 ; /bin/date'  However, my x86 box simply prints an error on the console about failing to load the interpreter for binfmt-464c.  Thus, the steps listed to reproduce the problem are inadequate.  Please try to reproduce this problem on the latest released kernel (which is version 2.4.21-32.0.1.EL, a post-U5 security erratum) that is untainted. Also, please correct the hardware architecture of this bug report if you're not using an x86-based system.

The problem is that load_elf_binary() -- which is trying to load a legitimate ELF binary, is returning -ENOEXEC back to search_binary_handler() because load_elf_interp() has returned a BAD_ADDR:          if (elf_interpreter) {                 if (interpreter_type == INTERPRETER_AOUT)                         elf_entry = load_aout_interp(&interp_ex,                                                      interpreter);                 else                         elf_entry = load_elf_interp(&interp_elf_ex,                                                     interpreter,                                                     &interp_load_addr);                  if (BAD_ADDR(elf_entry)) {                         printk(KERN_ERR "Unable to load interpreter\n");                         send_sig(SIGSEGV, current, 0);                         retval = -ENOEXEC; /* Nobody gets to see this, but.. */                         goto out_free_dentry;                 }                 reloc_func_desc = interp_load_addr;                  allow_write_access(interpreter);                 fput(interpreter);                 kfree(elf_interpreter);         }  and *because* search_binary_handler() sees the -ENOEXEC, it kicks off the attempt to load the bogus module.  And therein lies the problem, for whatever reason, the modprobe process results in the double-fault, and the original exec operation continues, and fails as it should.  But that all may be a red herring, since ENOEXEC with respect to execve means:         ENOEXEC An  executable  is  not in a recognised format, is for the wrong               architecture, or has some other format error that means it  can-               not be executed.  However in this case, that's not at all true.  It's legitimate, but the attempt to load the /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 interpreter into the limited address space fails, and load_elf_interp() returns -ENOMEM.  But the ENOMEM is "lost" in the elf_entry variable.  However, if -ENOMEM is in fact returned back to search_binary_handler(), it all works just fine.  ENOMEM with respect to execve means:         ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.  which isn't *exactly* what's going on here, but pretty close...  There's also the question of why the modprobe is failing, given that the bogus module name doesn't exist.  You would think that shouldn't cause the kernel to double-fault.  I mean do *all* of the request_module() calls in the kernel require that the target module pre-exist?  Since the kernel seems to handle it differently/successfully on at least i386 and ia64, I haven't determined whether the request_module() is even attempted on those architectures, or whether the operation fails in a different code path.     ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=161925#c10)  Dave Anderson    2005-09-01 14:18:01 UTC  ```  Working on a patch that addresses both problems, i.e., having load_elf_binary() return the proper errno value (ENOMEM), and preventing the request_module() from double-faulting -- presumably because the modprobe exec is reacting to the limited address space inherited from the process calling request_module().  The ENOMEM return will fix this problem, but for ELF objects only.  If a legitimate "odd" binfmt request did in fact come in, and the user had done ulimit beforehand, then the oops would still occur.  Thanks for the report -- and sorry for the delay.     ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=161925#c14)  Mark J.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
