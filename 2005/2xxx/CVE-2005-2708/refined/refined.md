{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the kernel's handling of errors when loading ELF binaries with a limited address space. Specifically, when the `load_elf_interp()` function fails (e.g., due to insufficient memory when loading the interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2), it returns an error that is not properly propagated. The parent function `load_elf_binary()` converts this to a generic `-ENOEXEC` error which causes `search_binary_handler()` to attempt to load a bogus module, triggering a double fault within the `modprobe` process due to the limited address space inherited from the original process.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper error handling: The kernel does not correctly propagate the specific error (ENOMEM) from `load_elf_interp()` to `search_binary_handler()` which can result in the execution of a wrong path.",
    "Insufficient resource checking within the kernel when handling the request module",
    "Lack of proper validation in `request_module()` calls can lead to unexpected crashes when attempting to load a module with invalid format or under constrained environment."
  ],
  "Impact": "A local user can cause a kernel panic, leading to a denial of service on the system. The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to execute a program with an address space limit low enough to cause the interpreter loading failure.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is triggered via local execution of a specially crafted executable binary or by using `ulimit -v` to limit the virtual memory of a process and then executing any program.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the vulnerable system capable of executing arbitrary code."
