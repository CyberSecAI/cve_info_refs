```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- The `VIfromLine()` function in `SRC/object/VIews.c` has a boundary error when copying input to a buffer (`tmpstr[256]`) on the stack, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- The `FIOgetargv()` function in `SRC/object/fileio.c` has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to an unbounded loop writing past the end of the `buf[256]` buffer, or due to a lack of element checking with the `*argv[128]` array.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Stack-based buffer overflow in `VIfromLine()` due to unbounded loop copying input into fixed-size buffer.
- Stack-based buffer overflow in `FIOgetargv()` due to unbounded loop or lack of bounds checking on an array

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the user running the gopher client.
- System compromise, potentially allowing attackers to take total control if the client is run with elevated privileges.

Attack vectors:
- Malicious Gopher server sending an overly long "+VIEWS:" reply message.
- Malicious string or link on an untrusted server that is processed by the gopher client, particularly when invoking a third-party program.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to set up a malicious Gopher server or control a server to serve malicious links.
- The victim needs to connect to the malicious server or click a malicious link with the vulnerable gopher client.
