Package        : gopher
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2772

Several buffer overflows have been discovered in gopher, a
text-oriented client for the Gopher Distributed Hypertext protocol,
that can be exploited by a malicious Gopher server.

For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.3woody4.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.7sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11.

We recommend that you upgrade your gopher package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## UMN Gopher vulnerable to buffer overflow via overly long "+VIEWS:"

#### Vulnerability Note VU#619812

Original Release Date: 2005-09-02 | Last Revised: 2005-09-02

---

### Overview

The University of Minnesota Gopher client may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow when handling overly long "+VIEWS:" reply messages sent from a malicious server.

### Description

| The [UMN Gopher suite](http://quux.org/devel/gopher/Downloads) includes a Gopher client for navigating Gopherspace. However, the Gopher client may incorrectly handle a reply message from the server with overly long "+VIEWS:" content. The VIfromLine() function contains a boundary error when copying input to a buffer on the stack, which may cause a stack-based buffer overflow condition.  Successful exploitation may allow remote arbitrary code execution. If the user is running the gopher client with elevated privileges, the system may be compromised to the point of the attacking taking total control.The Gopher protocol is generally disused at present and is disabled or not included in many popular web browsers and operating systems. However, the UMN Gopher code may be present in other clients, and as such may be exploitable by clicking on a seemingly-benign web link on a modern web browser. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the remote system by convincing the user to follow a gopher link. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Disable Gopher support**Unless a specific need is known for Gopher support in your web browser or operating system, either disable support in the application or remove the Gopher application(s) from the system. This will help to mitigate future attacks should the Gopher code in question not be updated in a timely fashion.**Only connect to trusted hosts**As a best practice, do not connect to Gopher hosts or follow web links you are unfamiliar with. This may not mitigate the vulnerability exposure completely as it is not possible to be certain a server has not been compromised.**Apply an update**Contact your vendor for updates, fixes, and workarounds. |

1. BACKGROUND

The Internet Gopher Client is based on the UMN Gopher/Gopherd 2.3.1 code. Gopher
is an Internet technology that predates the Web. It presents information as a virtual
network-wide filesystem. Modern browsers such as Konqueror can display gopherspace as
if it contained files on your local machine (trees, drag and drop, etc.), but the
difference is that each file or folder in that tree may be on a different machine.

2. DESCRIPTION

i figured i would audit the gopher program family one last time(part 3 of 3, a
trilogy!), this time the client instead of the server.

gopher(v3.0.9 and below) contains a two remotely exploitable buffer overflows.  the
first is in the processing of "+VIEWS:" information, located in SRC/object/VIews.c in
the VIfromLine() function.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
boolean
VIfromLine(VIewobj *vi, char *line)
{
     char tmpstr[256], *cp;
     int i;

     /** Okay, read until the next space, put the result in tmpstr **/
     for (cp = line,i=0; (*cp != ' '&&*cp!='\0'&&*cp!=':'); cp++,i++)
	  tmpstr[i] = *cp;

     tmpstr[i]='\0';
     line = cp+1;
     VIsetType(vi, tmpstr);

     if (*line == '\0')
	  return(FALSE);

     /** Parse language **/
     if (*line != ':') {
	  for (cp = line,i=0; (*cp != ' '&&*cp!='\0'&& *cp!=':'); cp++,i++)
	       tmpstr[i] = *cp;
	  tmpstr[i]='\0';
	  line = cp+1;
	  VIsetLang(vi, tmpstr);
     }

     if (*line == '\0')
	  return(FALSE);

     /** Okay, parse off the size (if present) **/
     cp = strchr(line,'<');

     if (cp != NULL) {
	  for (cp++,i=0; (*cp!='\0'&& *cp!='>'); cp++,i++)
	       tmpstr[i] = *cp;
	  tmpstr[i]='\0';
	  line = cp+1;
	  VIsetSize(vi, tmpstr);
     }

     if (*line != '\0')
	  VIsetComments(vi, line);

     return(TRUE);
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this can be exploited immediately upon the client's connection to an untrusted server.
the overflow itself occurs when an unbounded loop writes past the end of the tmpstr[256]
buffer, making this a stack overflow.  however, do to a null-byte that gets appended during
the overflow you must replace the "VIewobj *vi" value with what it was meant to be--this
makes exploitation more involved and specific to each system.

an example listing that will cause the overflow is as follows. (<...> = replace with real
values)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+-1<N>
+INFO: 0filler<TAB>filler<TAB>filler<TAB>filler<N>
+VIEWS:<TAB><N><SPACE>
<SPACE><256+ bytes of data/overflow><N>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the second buffer overflow is in the processing of arguments when executing third
party programs.  this can be abused best by forging a web link which launches a third
party web browser.  other methods also work, they are just more obvious.  the vulnerable
code is located in SRC/object/fileio.c in the FIOgetargv() function.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
static char **
FIOgetargv(char *cmd)
{
     int           inquote = 0;
     int           insquote = 0;
     int           i;
     static char  *argv[128];		/* Sufficient for now.. */

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
this can be exploited via a malicious string/link placed on an untrusted server. the
overflow itself occurs when an unbounded loop writes past the end of the buf[256], or
lack of element checking with the *argv[128] array--depending on the method used.  the
vulnerability is a standard stack overflow, however many (non-alnum) characters get
changed/truncated during this process making exploitation more involved.

an example listing that will cause the overflow is as follows. (<...> = replace with real
values)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+-1<N>
+INFO: hWeblink<TAB>filler<TAB><256+ bytes of data/overflow><TAB>filler<TAB>filler<N>
+VIEWS:<N>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(it should be noted that the "legacy" University of Minnesota versions(v2.x.x) also
have the same code present)

3. ANALYSIS

successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities will result in the ability of untrusted
gopher servers to execute arbitrary code as the user running the gopher client.

4. EXPLOIT (<http://fakehalo.us/xgopher-client.c>, for the first overflow mentioned)

/*[ gopher[v3.0.9+]: remote (client) buffer overflow exploit. ]*

 * The Internet Gopher Client is based on the UMN              *
 * Gopher/Gopherd 2.3.1 code. Gopher is an Internet technology *
 * that predates the Web. It presents information as a virtual *
 * network-wide filesystem. Modern browsers such as Konqueror  *
 * can display gopherspace as if it contained files on your    *
 * local machine (trees, drag and drop, etc.), but the         *
 * difference is that each file or folder in that tree may be  *
 * on a different machine.                                     *
 *                                                             *
 * this client contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow *
 * in the processing of "+VIEWS:" information, located in      *
 * SRC/object/VIews.c in the VIfromLine() function.            *
 *                                                             *
 * this is a stack overflow that can be exploited immediately  *
 * upon the client's connection to an untrusted gopher server. *
 * while this is a stack overflow, exploitation of this        *
 * overflow is not completely standard, and special values     *
 * will be needed for it to work. (see the first three DEFINEs *
 * below)                                                      *
 *                                                             *
 * i made this simply to be sure it was possible to exploit,   *
 * tested successfully on mandrake/9.2 with gopher/3.0.9       *
 * compiled from source.                                       *

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
