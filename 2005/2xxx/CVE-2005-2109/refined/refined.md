Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2005-2109, as reported in the provided advisory for WordPress versions 1.5.1.2 and earlier:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Several XSS vulnerabilities exist within the WordPress admin section.
    *   Example URLs provided:
        *   `http://wordpress/wp-admin/post.php?action=confirmdeletecomment&p=1&comment=22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E%3C/script%3E`
        *   `http://wordpress/wp-admin/post.php?action=confirmdeletecomment&p=122%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E%3C/script%3E&comment=2`
    *   These XSS issues, while in the admin section, are considered high risk because an attacker with an admin's cookie can forge it and access the admin area.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   The XMLRPC server in WordPress is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   The vulnerability exists because the XMLRPC server receives data from the `$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA` variable, which is not sanitized by `magic_quotes_gpc()` or similar functions.
    *   This means that nearly every method within the XMLRPC server is potentially vulnerable.
    *   An example XML payload is provided to exploit the vulnerability and gain an admin hash:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <methodCall>
        <methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>
            <params>
                <param><value><string>
                foobar' UNION SELECT 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 FROM wp_users
                WHERE (user_login='admin' AND MID(user_pass,1,1)='2')/*
                </string></value></param>
                <param><value><string><http://host/?p=1#1></string></value>
                </param><param><value><string>admin</string></value></param>
            </params>
        </methodCall>
        ```
    *   The SQL injection allows an attacker to retrieve password hashes.
    *   The attacker can then use this hash, along with the user login name, to forge a cookie and access the admin section.
*  **Forgotten Password Security Issues:**
    *   If `register_globals` is enabled, an attacker can exploit an uninitialized `$message` variable in `wp-login.php`.
    *   This allows the attacker to prepend arbitrary content to the password reset email.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   Several files disclose the full physical path of the server.
    *   Examples:
        *   `http://wordpress/wp-admin/menu-header.php`
        *   `http://wordpress/wp-atom.php?feed=1`
        *   `http://wordpress/wp-rss.php?feed=1`
        *   `http://wordpress/wp-rss2.php?feed=1`
    *   These disclosures aid attackers by revealing the system's file structure, facilitating further attacks.

**Root Cause:**

*   **XSS:** Lack of proper input sanitization in the admin section, specifically in the comment deletion confirmation functionality.
*   **SQL Injection:** The XMLRPC server processes data from the `$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA` variable without adequate sanitization, while the rest of the application uses `magic_quotes_gpc` for sanitizing user-supplied data, leading to a bypass of intended security measures.
*   **Forgotten Password Issue:** Uninitialized variable usage in the password reset functionality when `register_globals` is enabled.
*  **Full Path Disclosure:** Improper error handling and lack of protection for certain PHP files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can steal admin cookies, gaining access to the admin panel. This could allow the injection of malicious code via plugins.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can retrieve password hashes, gain admin access by forging a cookie, and then execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious PHP code into plugins.
*   **Forgotten Password Issue:** An attacker can alter password reset emails, potentially leading to phishing attacks.
*  **Full Path Disclosure:** Information leakage of the system's file structure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript code are used to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **SQL Injection:** Malicious XML requests to the XMLRPC server exploit the lack of input sanitization.
*   **Forgotten Password Issue:** Malicious requests to the password reset functionality when `register_globals` is enabled.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Direct access to specific vulnerable files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to lure an admin user to click on a malicious link.
*  **SQL Injection:** An attacker needs the ability to send crafted XML requests to the WordPress XMLRPC server. No authentication is needed for the initial SQL injection.
*   **Forgotten Password Issue:** The attacker needs to send crafted requests to the `wp-login.php` script while `register_globals` is enabled.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** No special access required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also includes a Perl script `wpcmdexec.pl` that automates the exploitation of the SQL Injection vulnerability and demonstrates how to achieve remote code execution.
*   The script automates the process of extracting the password hash of the admin user through SQL injection, and uses the hash to create a session cookie and login to the administrative panel and inject and execute code by editing plugin files.
