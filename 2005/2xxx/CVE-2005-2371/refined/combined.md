Dear Bugtraq Reader

3 months ago (15-april-2005) I informed the Oracle Security Team \
(secalert_us@oracle.com) that I will publish bug details if the bugs are not fixed \
with the next critical patch update (CPU July 2005). I know that Oracle products are \
complex and a good patch quality need some time. That's why I offered Oracle \
additional time if 3 months are not sufficient for fixing the bugs. Oracle never \
asked for more time.

Oracle's behaviour not fixing critical security bugs for a long time (over 650 days) \
is not acceptable for their customers. Oracle put their customers in danger. At least \
one critical vulnerability can be abused from any attacker via internet.

I decided to publish these vulnerabilities because it is possible to mitigate the \
risk of these vulnerabilities by using the workarounds provided in the advisories.

Kind Regards

 Alexander Kornbrust

Details
#######
Oracle Reports is Oracle's award-winning, high-fidelity enterprise reporting
tool. It enables businesses to give immediate access to information to all
levels within and outside of the organization in an unrivaled scalable and
secure environment.

Oracle Reports, a component of the Oracle Application Server, is used by Oracle
itself for the E-Business Suite. Many large customers are using Oracle Reports
as reporting tool for their enterprise applications.

By specifing a special value for the parameter desname Oracle Reports can
overwrite any file on the application server.
On Windows systems an attacker can overwrite any files (e.g. boot.ini) on the
application server. On UNIX system an attacker can overwrite all files (e.g.
opmn.xml) which belongs to the Oracle Application Server user.

This attack can be done with a simple URL.

TestURL
#######
Will be provided if a patch is available.

Workaround
##########

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
