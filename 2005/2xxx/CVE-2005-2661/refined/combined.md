| [Description](#c0)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 09:19:09 UTC  ``` For some reason evolution-mail segfaults.  Specifically, I see evolution  segfault when I click on mail and then the mail-settings option. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 11:06:54 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 11](show_bug.cgi?id=11 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Evolution: mailcomponent crashes when opening mailsettings") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 14:57:53 UTC  ``` test ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 19:28:48 UTC  ``` Ok, have a way of going around the issue (I think).  The problem seems to occur if the mailclient crashes before you close the program the first time the configure-database gets corrupted.   If you directly after Evolution starts for the first time exits cleanly it seems to be working as it should after that. Can this be confirmed somewhere else?   ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 20:45:26 UTC  ``` The shutdown-just-after-starting-the-first-time solution seems to work just fine.  Yayyyy!!!  Changing severity to minor, now that we have a  work-around. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 22:17:53 UTC  ``` I had this problem and had to login to my IMAP server first before opening mail settings.  I'm marking this as fixed since I think it's more of an evolution issue than anything we're doing wrong. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 23:48:45 UTC  ``` Please don't do this. I am assigned to the bug and I haven't marked it as being resolved since I want to look in to the issue. No other distributions has this problem. I wan't to make sure it's not due to our default -O3 CFLAGS. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-07 13:00:08 UTC  ``` Hmmm.  I often get a segfault when trying to print from an email, but it doesn't happen all of the time.  Worse, I don't see any pattern of when it happens. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  JP Sartre    2002-01-19 11:14:09 UTC  ``` Well, I don't know about you guys, but I segfault everytime I try to apply a new filter. Just installed gentoo, so maybe I'm missing something? I can read and delete email fine, just can't add filters. Not sure if this is related or should be a new bug?  JP ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-19 12:19:36 UTC  ``` it's probably not related.  ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-26 11:00:41 UTC  ``` The filter crash is fixed in 1.0.1-r2.  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-07 10:08:37 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 563](show_bug.cgi?id=563 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Evolution Mail Settings Broken") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-08 15:27:11 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 602](show_bug.cgi?id=602 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - evolution segfault") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Nathan Quinlan    2002-05-28 07:55:42 UTC  ``` First time installer of Gentoo, I got the iso image last week and finished  installing everything yesturday.  This Evolution bug still appears to exist.   Emerge installed Evolution 1.0.5 and since I didn't exit after doing the wizard  the evolution-mail process keeps segfaulting. After removing ~/evolution and following the work around it no longer segfaults  but this bug still happens.  Should be re-opened. ``` |  |

# IMAP Proxy: Format string vulnerabilities — GLSA **200603-04**

Format string vulnerabilities in IMAP Proxy may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code when connected to malicious IMAP servers.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/up-imapproxy** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.4** |

### Background

IMAP Proxy (also known as up-imapproxy) proxies IMAP transactions
between an IMAP client and an IMAP server.

### Description

Steve Kemp discovered two format string errors in IMAP Proxy.

### Impact

A remote attacker could design a malicious IMAP server and entice
someone to connect to it using IMAP Proxy, resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code with the rights of the victim user.

### Workaround

Only connect to trusted IMAP servers using IMAP Proxy.

### Resolution

All IMAP Proxy users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/up-imapproxy-1.2.4"
```

Package        : up-imapproxy
Vulnerability  : format string vulnerability
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2661

Steve Kemp discovered two format string vulnerabilities in
up-imapproxy, an IMAP protocol proxy, which may lead remote attackers
to the execution of arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.4-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your imapproxy package.
