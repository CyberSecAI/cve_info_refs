Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a boundary error within the ACE archive decompression library (`vrAZace.dll`) used by various HAURI anti-virus products. Specifically, the error occurs during the extraction of ACE archives.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when a specially crafted ACE archive containing a compressed file with an overly long filename (longer than 272 characters) is processed. The library fails to properly handle the filename length, leading to a buffer overflow during decompression.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this buffer overflow allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This means a malicious actor could gain complete control over the compromised machine.
*   **System Compromise:** The vulnerability can lead to a complete compromise of the system running the affected HAURI anti-virus software.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious ACE Archive:** The primary attack vector involves using a maliciously crafted ACE archive file. This archive must contain a compressed file with a filename exceeding 272 characters.
*   **File Scanning:** The attack requires that the anti-virus software has the functionality to scan compressed files enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Deliver Malicious File:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted ACE archive to a system running a vulnerable version of HAURI anti-virus software. This could be achieved through various methods such as email, web downloads, or other file transfer methods.
*   **Compressed File Scanning Enabled:** The target system needs to have the compressed file scanning feature enabled in their anti-virus settings for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Affected Software:**

*   ViRobot Expert 4.0
*   ViRobot Advanced Server
*   ViRobot Linux Server 2.0
*   HAURI LiveCall

The advisory notes that other versions may also be affected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered "Highly Critical" due to its ability to grant an attacker system-level access.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tan Chew Keong of Secunia Research.
*   Patches are available for affected products.
*   The vulnerability was assigned Secunia Advisory ID SA14359.
