- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing input sanitization before executing shell commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Insufficient input sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary shell commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the processing of inputs that are used in shell commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to provide crafted input that is then used in shell command execution within the affix Bluetooth FTP client.
