Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2005-2256:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization of the `formLanguage` parameter in the `index.php` file of phpPgAdmin. This parameter is used to include files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application directly uses user-supplied input (`formLanguage`) to include files, making it vulnerable to including arbitrary files from the local server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to read the content of files on the server, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, local file inclusion vulnerabilities can sometimes lead to remote code execution, depending on the server configuration and the nature of the included file.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that contains the `formLanguage` parameter pointing to a local file.
*   **Remote Network:** The attack can be performed remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable phpPgAdmin instance.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   `magic_quotes_gpc` must be disabled for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional notes:**
*   The Debian security advisory explicitly mentions that the old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by the problem, while the stable (sarge) and unstable (sid) distributions are affected.
*   Patches were released for the stable (sarge) and unstable (sid) distributions.
