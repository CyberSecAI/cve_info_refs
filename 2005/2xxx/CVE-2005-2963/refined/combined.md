How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
October 5th, 2005                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : mod-auth-shadow
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2963
Debian Bug     : 323789

A vulnerability in mod_auth_shadow, an Apache module that lets users
perform HTTP authentication against /etc/shadow, has been discovered.
The module runs for all locations that use the 'require group'
directive which would bypass access restrictions controlled by another
authorisation mechanism, such as AuthGroupFile file, if the username
is listed in the password file and in the gshadow file in the proper
group and the supplied password matches against the one in the shadow
file.

This update requires an explicit "AuthShadow on" statement if website
authentication should be checked against /etc/shadow.

For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-3.1woody.2.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-auth-shadow package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Date: Thu, 18 Aug 2005 13:55:08 +0200
```
Package: libapache-mod-auth-shadow
Version: 1.4-1

Maintainer: Marcin Owsiany <porridge at debian.org>

  I experience problems with the mod-auth-shadow Apache2 module when used in conjunction
with FrontPage extentions on the same server. The problem appears to be that mod-auth-shadow
automatically turns itself on (although 'AuthShadow on' isn't present) when one uses the
'require group' directive.

Unfortunately no patch at the SourceForge site, just a confirmation of the bug:

[----- from SourceForge Patch Archives -----]
AuthShadow off fallback mod_auth fix To fix the incorrect authorization result use together
with mod_auth. If "AuthShadow off" is specified, it should fall back to "mod_auth" (if
enabled). But before patching it will always fail if specified "require group" in .htaccess.

The following .htaccess can demonstrate the abnormal behaviour:

AuthShadow off
AuthType Basic
AuthName "My Test"
AuthUserFile /home/alan/myuserfile
AuthGroupFile /home/alan/mygroupfile
require group mygroup

Thanks for the report. Unfortunately I have never used frontpage
extensions, so I could use some more help.

I need some clarification. Is adding "AuthShadow off" sufficient to make
it work like it should? Or is that command included just to show that
even explicitly disabling authshadow doesn't help?

No need to keep those lines, they are just single-time commands for
debian BTS control bot :)

Also, when replying, please keep 323789@bugs.debian.org in CC, rather
than control@bugs.debian.org. The latter is for bug metadata
manipulation.

Yes, now I can reproduce the problem. I'll work with the upstream
maintainer and/or try to debug this myself.

It was OK, but I got misled by the frontpage bit that the bug is somehow
frontpage-specific.

Subject: mod\_auth\_shadow turning itself on with require group
Date: Thu, 8 Sep 2005 19:58:10 +0200
```
Hi!

I have received a bug report on mod_auth_shadow, which you can see with
all replies at <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=323789>

The problem is that mod_auth_shadow always turns itself on, when
"require group <whatever>" is used in the same scope. This makes it
impossible to use any other authentication modules with "require group"
when mod_auth_shadow is loaded.

"AuthShadow off" seems to have no effect.

I could reproduce that with the following:

-------------------------------------------------
mkdir ~/public_html/test/
cat << END > ~/public_html/test/.htaccess
AuthShadow off
AuthType Basic
AuthName "My Test"
AuthUserFile /tmp/tuser
AuthGroupFile /tmp/tgroup
require group foogroup
END
echo 'oj:' > /tmp/tuser
echo 'foogroup: oj' > /tmp/tgroup
wget -S -O/dev/null --http-user=oj --http-password='' <http://localhost/~porridge/test/>
-------------------------------------------------

error.log contains:

[Thu Sep  8 19:32:22 2005] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] access to /~porridge/test/ failed.  Reason: user oj not allowed access

Modifying apache configuration not to load auth_shadow (and removing the
"AuthShadow off" line) makes the above work as expected.

Please keep 323789-forwarded@bugs.debian.org in Cc when replying to this
message.

regards,

Marcin

I have prepared packages which seem to fix this issue for me.
They available at
<http://people.debian.org/~porridge/mod-auth-shadow-test/>
which is also aptable as:
deb <http://people.debian.org/~porridge/mod-auth-shadow-test/> ./

Please test whether they fix the issue for you and report back.

Hi!

mod_auth_shadow is an apache module which lets you perform HTTP
authentication against /etc/shadow. Whether it should act for certain
location or directory, is controled with AuthShadow on/off directive.

However, it seems that one of the handlers mistakenly does not check the
status of this directive, which means that mod_auth_shadow always runs
for locations which have "require group <somegroup>" specified.

This was reported upstream by someone over a year ago
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1008478&group_id=11283&atid=311283>

Since authorization is involved, this bug is security-related. If the
user were lucky, and /etc/{group,shadow} gave access to some group, but
other authentication mechanism didn't, then this would mean granting
them access unintentionally.

I have prepared packages which seem to work for me and asked the bug
submitter to test them. I also posted the patch to the SF patch forum,
and forwarded it upstream, which might get some more testing.
The preliminary sid packages are at
deb <http://people.debian.org/~porridge/mod-auth-shadow-test/> ./

Either way, this patch inevitably changes the package behavior, since
now an explicit "AuthShadow on" is needed also with "require group
<...>". I wonder whether I should add a NEWS.Debian note...

I think that an advisory should be prepared. In such case, the behavior
change should be warned about in the advisory as well.

please let me know what you think,

Marcin

Superb, the module now works flawlessly!

I use mod_auth_shadow-2.0-1 though so I had to make a tiny adjustment to your
patch to get it to compile/work though:

        auth_shadow_config_rec *s = (auth_shadow_config_rec *)
-              ap_get_module_config(r->per_dir_config, &authshadow_module);
+              ap_get_module_config(r->per_dir_config, &auth_shadow_module);

        if (s->auth_shadow_flag != 1)
             return DECLINED;

I see -- yes, it 'turns itself on' in the sense that it validates the
user/group.  But it declines to validate the password.  (The end result
being that for users to be valid they have to pass the user/groups
tests in mod_auth_shadow even if AuthShadow is off.)

Yes, it looks good.  Thanks a lot.  I've applied it, and released
a new version (1.5).
