The provided content discusses HTTP Request Smuggling, a vulnerability technique, but it does not provide information directly related to CVE-2005-2093.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the discrepancies in how different HTTP devices/entities (e.g., cache servers, proxy servers, web application firewalls) parse malformed HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness is the failure of HTTP servers or devices to properly handle malformed inbound HTTP requests, leading to parsing inconsistencies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of HTTP Request Smuggling can lead to:
    - Web cache poisoning (associating a URL to the wrong content in the cache).
    - Session hijacking.
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS).
    - Bypassing web application firewalls (allowing attacks like worms or buffer overflows to reach the web server).
    - Manipulation of the web server's request/response sequencing, enabling credential hijacking.

**Attack vectors:**
Attackers craft multiple specially-crafted HTTP requests that cause the targeted entities to interpret different sets of requests. This allows for smuggling a request to one device without the other being aware of it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a system with multiple HTTP devices/entities in the data flow between the user and the web server. They also need the knowledge to craft malformed HTTP requests to cause parsing discrepancies.

Therefore, the provided content is related to HTTP Request Smuggling in general and not specifically to CVE-2005-2093, hence it's not possible to provide information directly related to the CVE.
