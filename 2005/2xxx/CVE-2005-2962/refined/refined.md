Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a post-installation script in the `ntlmaps` package that incorrectly sets the permissions of the configuration file.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the setting of world-readable permissions on the `ntlmaps` configuration file. This configuration file contains sensitive information: the username and password used to connect to a Windows NT system.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker (local user) can gain access to the stored username and password, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the Windows NT system the proxy is configured to connect to. This constitutes an information leak.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access to the system where `ntlmaps` is installed. Any user with read access to the configuration file can extract the credentials.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the vulnerable `ntlmaps` package is installed. No special privileges are required beyond being able to read files.
