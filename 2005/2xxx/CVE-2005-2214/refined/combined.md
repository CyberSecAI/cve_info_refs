How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: world readable apt.conf with proxy passwd
Date: Mon, 18 Apr 2005 10:06:07 +0200
```
Package: apt
Version: 0.5.28.1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

During install apt.conf is written; including proxy configuration if
needed. The Proxy string is stored in apt.conf but permissions allow
group and others to read apt.conf hence to get the proxy password which
could even be a real users password.

Best regards,

Alexander Mader.

Which happens to be apt-setup from base-config if I'm correct...

apt-setup in Debian GNU/Linux installs the apt.conf file with insecure
permissions, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information
such as passwords.

This is severity inflation: This bug affects a minority of a minority of
users (users who have a proxy that requires a password, have some reason
to use it for apt, and somehow have managed to avoid the inherent
security issues of the http password being sent in the clear over the
network).

The only real solution to this bug is to remove support for passwords in
the proxy setting. Making the file mode 600 by default, or even only if
a password is present cripples the system for regular users by breaking
apt-get source and hardly makes it anymore secure anyway.

An option is to only support the http_proxy and ftp_proxy environment
variables, but this is painful in other ways (bug #123144).

Another option is to move the proxy settings to a separate file and
read this file too.
