Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-2341:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the Research in Motion (RIM) BlackBerry Attachment Service. This flaw occurs specifically when the service renders TIFF image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap overflow: The vulnerability is due to a heap overflow that is triggered when a specially crafted TIFF file is processed by the BlackBerry Attachment Service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service of the BlackBerry Attachment Service. The service stops functioning.
- Impact may be limited: The denial of service may only affect some users, and the service might restart automatically after a period of time or when manually restarted. Other services such as sending/receiving messages, calls, internet browsing or running handheld applications are unaffected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email attachment: The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted TIFF image as an email attachment.
- User interaction: The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the malicious TIFF image on a BlackBerry Handheld device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker: The attacker can be remote and does not need to be authenticated.
- Ability to craft a malicious TIFF image: The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted TIFF file that will trigger the heap overflow.
- Ability to send email: The attacker needs the ability to send an email to a user.
- Requires user interaction: The attacker must rely on the user to open the malicious attachment on their BlackBerry device.

**Additional Details:**
- The BlackBerry Attachment Service is responsible for rendering certain types of email attachments for display on BlackBerry devices.
- The service may automatically restart after a period of time (default is 25 minutes), or can be manually restarted by an administrator.
- A temporary solution is suggested to either exclude TIFF images or to disable the attachment service completely.
- The vulnerability was reported by FX of Phenoelit.
