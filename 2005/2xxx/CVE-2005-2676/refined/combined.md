A XSS vulnerability has been found in EXIF data. As Coppermine is capable of displaying EXIF data, everybody who runs coppermine (any version) will have to apply this security fix as soon as possible:

* users running cpg1.3.3 should download the file attached, rename it from "displayimage.txt" to "displayimage.php" and upload it to their webserver into the coppermine root folder, replacing the existing file on the server.
* users running any previous version should upgrade to cpg1.3.4, as there are several other things that have been fixed. If you can't do this now, make sure to fix the vulnerability: Edit displayimage.php with a text editor, findCode Select Expand`if (isset($exif) && is_array($exif)) {`and replace withCode Select Expand`if (isset($exif) && is_array($exif)) {
          //Sanitize the data - to fix the XSS vulnerability - Aditya
          foreach ($exif as $key=>$data) {
            $exif[$key] = htmlentities(strip_tags(trim($data,"\x7f..\xff\x0..\x1f")),ENT_QUOTES); //sanitize data against sql/html injection; trim any nongraphical non-ASCII character:
          }`
  Next, find
  Code Select Expand`if (isset($iptc) && is_array($iptc)) {
          if (isset($iptc['Title'])) $info[$lang_picinfo['iptcTitle']] = trim($iptc['Title']);
          if (isset($iptc['Copyright'])) $info[$lang_picinfo['iptcCopyright']] = trim($iptc['Copyright']);
          if (!empty($iptc['Keywords'])) $info[$lang_picinfo['iptcKeywords']] = trim(implode(" ",$iptc['Keywords']));
          if (isset($iptc['Category'])) $info[$lang_picinfo['iptcCategory']] = trim($iptc['Category']);
          if (!empty($iptc['SubCategories'])) $info[$lang_picinfo['iptcSubCategories']] = trim(implode(" ",$iptc['SubCategories']));
      }`
  and replace with
  Code Select Expand`if (isset($iptc) && is_array($iptc)) {
          //Sanitize the data - to fix the XSS vulnerability - Aditya
          foreach ($iptc as $key=>$data) {
            $iptc[$key] = htmlentities(strip_tags(trim($data,"\x7f..\xff\x0..\x1f")),ENT_QUOTES); //sanitize data against sql/html injection; trim any nongraphical non-ASCII character:
          }
          if (isset($iptc['Title'])) $info[$lang_picinfo['iptcTitle']] = trim($iptc['Title']);
          if (isset($iptc['Copyright'])) $info[$lang_picinfo['iptcCopyright']] = trim($iptc['Copyright']);
          if (!empty($iptc['Keywords'])) $info[$lang_picinfo['iptcKeywords']] = trim(implode(" ",$iptc['Keywords']));
          if (isset($iptc['Category'])) $info[$lang_picinfo['iptcCategory']] = trim($iptc['Category']);
          if (!empty($iptc['SubCategories'])) $info[$lang_picinfo['iptcSubCategories']] = trim(implode(" ",$iptc['SubCategories']));
      }`.
   Save your edits, then upload the edited file to your webserver, overwriting the exiting one.
* users running the devel version cpg1.4.x: make sure to update all your files from the cvs as suggested in the sticky thread on the cpg1.4 testing/bugs board.
* users running unsupported ports (especially those who run the deprecated nuke ports): we have no idea if the vulnerability exists in your code as well, but you should take a look at it and use the fix if applicable

~~I will package up a new stable release (cpg1.3.4) that will be available soon. It will contain the fix discussed in this thread.~~
[edit GauGau]
New package released: a brand new package cpg1.3.4 has been released that contains the above mentioned fix. - [Download cpg1.3.4](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/coppermine/cpg1.3.4.zip?download)

[edit]
Fixed the bug described below, uploaded new file and changed the instructions above accordingly. - Aditya

Had you enabled IPTC info before applying the above file - the line numbers you are saying are not the ones that were changed

[edit]
Yes - you are right bug is a side effect of the security fix ![:(](https://coppermine-gallery.com/forum/Smileys/default/sad.gif "Sad")

Grab the latest files from the CVS and you'll be good to go.

If someone does not allow other people to upload files, would this keep the gallery from being vulnerable to this?

I have just released the new package cpg1.3.4 that contains above mentioned fix - see the very first posting in this thread.

Everytime I visit my coppermine gallery a Microsoft Outlook Installer takes place and i cannot understand the reason why, but it really seems some kind of malware.
I tested on several machines and since this thing started this morning (italian time) i suppose it's related to this bug, but **even if i upload the new coppermine version (1.3.4) the problem still remains**.

I have to say the problem appears ONLY in Coppermine's pages and you can find it here (if you dare...) [www.maolu.it/gallery](//www.maolu.it/gallery)

Could this be related to the XSS vulnerability?

A kind thanks for your work

I'm visiting your gallery and no strange action take place.  You are not using exiff data in your picture. so your problems are not related with tihs bug.  Check your PC, clear the bowser cache, and try again

maolu has already resolved the issues he/she experienced: it wasn't coppermine acting up, but improper proxy settings. The whole issue is not related to the XSS vulnerability nor the fix, so I'm marking the postings that deal with it as "invalid".

@all: please do only reply to announcement threads like this one if you have something to say that everyone could benefit from (e.g. a broken link or similar). Individual issues you might consider to be related to XSS vulnerabilities should not go into this thread - start a new thread instead on the support board. Help us to keep announcement threads clean and focused on the issues they deal with. If announcement threads drift to much or contain irrelevant information, other users might miss important stuff because of the "background noise". We had to lock most announcement threads soon after they were started because people replied with irrelevant issues. Try not to mess with this thread as well, it'd be a pity if we had to lock it as we had to in the past.

Question:

This file [displayimage.php] makes a Coppermine install 1.3.3 into 1.3.4?  Or should 1.3.3 users download 1.3.4 release and upgrade?  I hope this reply is okay in this thread, if not sorry.

Yes I read that but I guess what I really wanted to know if I should update my Coppermine to version 1.3.4 [which I assume is stored in the DB].

You don't need to do anything with your database. The version number is stored in include/init.inc.php

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
