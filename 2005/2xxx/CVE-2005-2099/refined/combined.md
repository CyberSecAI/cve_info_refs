[PATCH] Module per-cpu alignment cannot always be met
Fwd from Daniel Drake .
The module code assumes noone will ever ask for a per-cpu area more than
SMP\_CACHE\_BYTES aligned. However, as these cases show, gcc asks sometimes
asks for 32-byte alignment for the per-cpu section on a module, and if
CONFIG\_X86\_L1\_CACHE\_SHIFT is 4, we hit that BUG\_ON(). This is obviously an
unusual combination, as there have been few reports, but better to warn
than die.

[PATCH] CAN-2005-2099 Destruction of failed keyring oopses
The attached patch makes sure that a keyring that failed to instantiate
properly is destroyed without oopsing [CAN-2005-2099].
The problem occurs in three stages:
(1) The key allocator initialises the type-specific data to all zeroes. In
the case of a keyring, this will become a link in the keyring name list
when the keyring is instantiated.
(2) If a user (any user) attempts to add a keyring with anything other than
an empty payload, the keyring instantiation function will fail with an
error and won't add the keyring to the name list.
(3) The keyring's destructor then sees that the keyring has a description
(name) and tries to remove the keyring from the name list, which oopses
because the link pointers are both zero.
This bug permits any user to take down a box trivially.

[PATCH] CAN-2005-2098 Error during attempt to join key management session can leave semaphore pinned
The attached patch prevents an error during the key session joining operation
from hanging future joins in the D state [CAN-2005-2098].
The problem is that the error handling path for the KEYCTL\_JOIN\_SESSION\_KEYRING
operation has one error path that doesn't release the session management
semaphore. Further attempts to get the semaphore will then sleep for ever in
the D state.
This can happen in four situations, all involving an attempt to allocate a new
session keyring:
(1) ENOMEM.
(2) The users key quota being reached.
(3) A keyring name that is an empty string.
(4) A keyring name that is too long.
Any user may attempt this operation, and so any user can cause the problem to
occur.

[PATCH] Check input buffer size in zisofs
Add fakey 'deflateBound()' function to the in-kernel zlib routines
It's not the real deflateBound() in newer zlib libraries, partly because
the upcoming usage of it won't have the "stream" available, so we can't
have the same interfaces anyway.
This uses the new deflateBound() thing to sanity-check the input to the
zlib decompressor before we even bother to start reading in the blocks.

[PATCH] x86\_64: Fixing smpboot timing problem
This patch fixes the SMP boot timing problem that hit various people and was
introduced in 2.6.12. Please apply to stable.
>From Eric Biederman
sync\_tsc was using smp\_call\_function to ask the boot processor
to report it's tsc value. smp\_call\_function performs an IPI\_send\_allbutself
which is a broadcast ipi. There is a window during processor startup during
which the target cpu has started and before it has initialized it's interrupt
vectors so it can properly process an interrupt. Receveing an interrupt
during that window will triple fault the cpu and do other nasty things.
Why cli does not protect us from that is beyond me.
The simple fix is to match ia64 and provide a smp\_call\_function\_single.
Which avoids the broadcast and is more efficient.
This certainly fixes the problem of getting stuck on boot which was
very easy to trigger on my SMP Hyperthreaded Xeon, and I think
it fixes it for the right reasons.

[PATCH] sys\_set\_mempolicy() doesnt check if mode < 0
A kernel BUG() is triggered by a call to set\_mempolicy() with a negative
first argument. This is because the mode is declared as an int, and the
validity check doesnt check < 0 values. Alternatively, mode could be
declared as unsigned int or unsigned long.
