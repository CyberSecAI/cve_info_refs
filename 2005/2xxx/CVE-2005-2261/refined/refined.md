      "description": "Scripts in XBL controls from web content continued to be run even when Javascript was disabled. By itself this causes no harm, but it could be combined with most script-based exploits to attack people running vulnerable versions who thought disabling javascript would protect them. In the Thunderbird and Mozilla Suite mail clients Javascript is disabled by default for protection against denial-of-service attacks and worms; this vulnerability could be used to bypass that protection.",

        "Failure to enforce content security policies on XBL scripts",
		"Bypassing Javascript disablement settings."
