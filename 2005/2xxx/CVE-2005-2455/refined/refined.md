Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2005-2455:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** A serious security vulnerability exists in Greasemonkey, specifically within the `GM_*` APIs. This vulnerability allows a website, if it matches a user script, to read any local file on the user's machine or list the contents of local directories.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `GM_*` APIs, which provide extra functionalities to Greasemonkey scripts. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Greasemonkey except for a "neutered" version 0.3.5.
    *   The `GM_xmlhttpRequest` API was specifically identified as problematic, because it can access local files, bypassing the same-origin policy limitation of the regular `XMLHttpRequest`.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A malicious website could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored on a user's local file system.
    *   Attackers could list the contents of directories, potentially leading to further exploitation.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Any website matching a user script is a potential attack vector. This includes wildcard (`*`) scripts.
    *  A website can exploit this flaw by accessing the `GM` object and using `GM_xmlhttpRequest` to fetch local files or list local directories.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to host a website that matches a user-installed Greasemonkey script.
    *   No direct access to the user's system is required; the attack can be performed through a web browser.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue affects all platforms where Greasemonkey is used.
*   The recommended immediate action was either to install Greasemonkey version 0.3.5 or to disable/uninstall Greasemonkey completely, while the developers worked on a fix. Version 0.3.5 is a "neutered" version lacking powerful GM\* APIs, and many scripts dependent on these APIs will fail to function properly.
*  While it was acknowledged that  `GM_xmlhttpRequest` is used by many user scripts because it allows cross-domain requests (unlike normal xmlHttpRequest), it also became the source of an exploitable security flaw when it was found to be able to access local files.
*  There were discussions about limiting the `GM_xmlhttpRequest` API instead of removing all `GM_*` APIs in the temporary fix.
*   Some users suggested using the NoScript Firefox extension as a mitigation method, as it blocks all JavaScript execution by default from untrusted pages.
