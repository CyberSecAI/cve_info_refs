      "vulnerability": "The `InstallTrigger.install()` method accepts a callback function that will be called with the final success or error status. By forcing a page navigation immediately after calling the install method this callback function can end up running in the context of the new page selected by the attacker.",

            "Same-origin policy violation",
            "Improper callback handling"
        ],
        "impact": "Callback script can steal data from the new page such as cookies or passwords, or perform actions on the user's behalf such as make a purchase if the user is already logged into the target site. This vulnerability is more critical in the Mozilla Suite where the install whitelist is disabled by default.",
