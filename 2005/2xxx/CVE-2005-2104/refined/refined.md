Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2005-2104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `sysreport` utility creates a temporary directory using an insecure method, specifically by directly using `/tmp/sysreport.$$`. This is problematic because the process ID (`$$`) is predictable and the directory is created with a wide open umask of `0077`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Temporary Directory Creation:** The use of `/tmp/sysreport.$$` is predictable and subject to race conditions.
- **Race Condition:** A local attacker can exploit the time between the directory creation and usage to create their own directory with the same name.
- **Insufficient Permissions:**  The umask `0077` is not secure enough as it is still readable by others.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause `sysreport` to write its output to a directory that the attacker controls. This allows the attacker to read the contents of the sysreport, potentially gaining access to sensitive system information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Race Condition Exploitation:** The attacker must be able to create a directory with the same name in the brief window between sysreport's creation attempt and usage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local user access on the vulnerable machine.
- The attacker must be able to execute commands to exploit the race condition.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- **Affected Products:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3 and 4.
- **Fixed Versions:** `sysreport-1.3.15-3` (RHEL4), `sysreport-1.3.7.2-7` (RHEL3) and `sysreport-1.3.7.0-5` (RHEL2.1).
- **Mitigation:**  The fix involves using `mktemp -d /tmp/sysreport.XXXXXXXX` to create the temporary directory, which is a safer method than `umask 0077 ROOT=/tmp/sysreport.$$`.
- **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by Bill Stearns.
