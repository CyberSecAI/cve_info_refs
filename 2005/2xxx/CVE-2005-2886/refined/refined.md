Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient file type validation during the upload process. The application blacklists certain file extensions but allows others (like .inc), which can contain executable code (PHP in this case).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The XSS vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in various modules and scripts, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Path Disclosure:** The application discloses file paths due to improper handling of file requests, potentially revealing sensitive information about the system's directory structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Upload:** The application uses a blacklist approach for file uploads instead of a whitelist. The blacklist is incomplete, allowing the upload of executable files like `.inc`.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Output Encoding:** Multiple scripts within the application fail to sanitize user input before rendering it in HTML, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Path Disclosure:** The application exposes directory paths through direct access to certain scripts, revealing the site's internal structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary system commands on the server, potentially gaining full control of the webserver, compromising data, or launching attacks against other systems.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially stealing user cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other client-side attacks.
*   **Path Disclosure:** An attacker could gain information about the server's file system structure, which could be used to find configuration files or other sensitive information and can also facilitate other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Upload a specially crafted file with a `.inc` extension containing malicious PHP code. Access the file via a direct URL with a command parameter.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Inject malicious JavaScript into specific parameters within the vulnerable URLs.
*   **Path Disclosure:** Direct access via a web browser to vulnerable scripts with no file extension specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:**
    *   Attacker needs to register on the website.
    *   Attacker can access the upload functionality.
    *   The server must be configured to execute files with the `.inc` extension as PHP scripts (or similar).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted URLs to a user of the application.
*   **Path Disclosure:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to make direct web requests to the vulnerable scripts.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory also points out the use of a blacklist instead of a whitelist for file uploads as an issue.
*   The `system()` function in the uploaded PHP code allows arbitrary command execution on the server.
*   The XSS vulnerabilities can be triggered using specially crafted URLs with script tags.
*   The path disclosure allows attackers to see the server's directory structure.
*   The attacker was able to find database credentials by using the remote command execution vulnerability to view the config file.
