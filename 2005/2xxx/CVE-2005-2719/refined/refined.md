{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Ventrilo server fails to properly handle malformed status packets received via UDP. Specifically, the server does not validate if the amount of data in the packet matches the amount specified in the header.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Lack of proper error handling"
    ],
    "impact": "The server crashes or exits abnormally. On Windows, the server logs an error message and aborts. On Linux, the server crashes within the `free()` function.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote exploitation via sending a malformed UDP status packet to the server's UDP port.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the server's port. No authentication is required."
