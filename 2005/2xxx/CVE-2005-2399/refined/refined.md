The provided content relates to multiple vulnerabilities in PHP Surveyor version 0.98 stable, which include SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and path disclosures. This matches the general description of CVE-2005-2399.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple files, including `browse.php`, `dataentry.php`, `export.php`, `admin.php`, `labels.php`, `dumplabel.php`, `conditions.php`, `spss.php`, `deletesurvey.php`, `dumpsurvey.php`, and `statistics.php` are vulnerable to SQL injection via various parameters such as `sid`, `start`, `id`, `lid`, and `qid`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The files `browse.php`, `dataentry.php`, and `export.php` are vulnerable to XSS via the same parameters that are vulnerable to SQL injection.
*  **Path Disclosure:** Multiple files, including `question.php`, `survey.php`, `group.php`, `database.php`, `dumpquestion.php`, `labels.php`, `sessioncontrol.php`, and `html.php`, are vulnerable to path disclosure.

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   The lack of sanitization also causes XSS vulnerabilities because user-supplied data is displayed without being encoded to prevent script injection.
*   Path disclosure occurs when sensitive file system paths are revealed due to insufficient error handling or direct access to specific files.

**Impact:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could manipulate database queries to access, modify, or delete data, potentially leading to data breaches, loss of data integrity, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Path Disclosure:** An attacker could obtain sensitive information about the server's filesystem, which can be used to exploit other vulnerabilities or plan more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors involve manipulating parameters passed via HTTP GET or POST requests to the vulnerable PHP scripts. These parameters are not validated or sanitized before being used, making them prone to SQL injection and XSS attacks.
*   Path disclosures are achievable by directly accessing vulnerable PHP files, leading to outputting system paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   The attacker requires a basic understanding of HTTP request manipulation and the ability to craft malicious SQL queries or JavaScript payloads.
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
