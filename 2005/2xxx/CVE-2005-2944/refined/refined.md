      "source": "bugs.gentoo.org_1c5f0e19_20250125_112126.html",
      "root_cause": "The GNOME Workstation Command Center (gwcc) creates a temporary file with a predictable name (/tmp/gwcc_out.txt) and then uses this filename in a command. This allows an attacker to create a symbolic link to a different file, causing the command to operate on that linked file instead of the intended temporary file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure temporary file creation",
        "Predictable temporary file name",
        "Symlink attack vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Local users can create and overwrite arbitrary files by exploiting the insecure temporary file creation and symlink attack vulnerability.",
       "attack_vector": "Local attacker creates a symbolic link with the name of the predictable temporary file to an arbitrary file. When gwcc runs a command on the predictable file, it operates on the attacker's linked file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker requires local access to the system to create the symbolic link."
