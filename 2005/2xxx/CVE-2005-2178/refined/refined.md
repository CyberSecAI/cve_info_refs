Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `probe.cgi` script's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, the script takes a parameter named `olddat` from the query string and directly uses it in a Perl `open()` function. The script doesn't validate or filter this input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input validation on the `olddat` parameter.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** By manipulating the `olddat` parameter, an attacker can force the script to attempt to open any file on the server that the webserver user has permissions to read.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** The usage of `|` (pipe) in the `olddat` parameter allows the execution of arbitrary shell commands by opening a pipe to the shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver user.
*   **Data Disclosure:**  The attacker can read arbitrary file data if the web server has read access to those files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request that includes the malicious `olddat` parameter in the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Knowledge of how to manipulate HTTP GET requests.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `probe.cgi`
*   The vulnerable line is: `open (VF, "$olddat");`
*   The attack vector is a URL such as: `http://the-vuln.site.org/cgi-bin/probe.cgi?olddat=|id|`
