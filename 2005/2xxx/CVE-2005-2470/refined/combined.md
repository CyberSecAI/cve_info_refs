How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Adobe Acrobat contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#896220

Original Release Date: 2005-08-16 | Last Revised: 2005-09-08

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow in Adobe Acrobat/Acrobat Reader may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition

### Description

| Adobe Acrobat is a suite of applications that allow users to manipulate PDF (Portable Document Format) files. A buffer within a core plug-in for Adobe Acrobat and Acrobat Reader can be overwritten using a specially-crafted PDF document.  For more information refer to Adobe Security Advisory [321644](http://www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/321644.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted PDF file, that attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or crash the Adobe Acrobat/Acrobat Reader process. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade to unaffected version**Upgrade to unaffected versions of Adobe Acrobat and Acrobat Reader. For a list of unaffected versions please see Adobe Security Advisory [321644](http://www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/321644.html). |
| --- |

| **Do not accept PDF files from untrusted sources**Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted PDF file. By only accessing PDF files from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. |

# Adobe Reader: Buffer Overflow â GLSA **200508-11**

Adobe Reader is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially
lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/acroread** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.0.1.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.0.1.1** |

### Background

Adobe Reader is a utility used to view PDF files.

### Description

A buffer overflow has been reported within a core application
plug-in, which is part of Adobe Reader.

### Impact

An attacker may create a specially-crafted PDF file, enticing a
user to open it. This could trigger a buffer overflow as the file is
being loaded, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Adobe Reader users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/acroread-7.0.1.1"
```

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
