How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CAN-2005-2315 	CAN-2005-2316  How-To-Repeat: 	1) Buffer overflow (CAN-2005-2315)  	* create a buffer, a DNS packet, bigger than 268 (256+12) bytes. 	* Fill the buffer with random data. 	* Clear the Z and QR flags. 	* Send it to dnrd. 	* Repeat til dnrd dies.  	Impact : this could probably be exploited to perform remote execution. 	However, dnrd runs in an chroot environment and runs as non-root.  	2) Infinite recursion causes stack overflow (CAN-2005-2316)  	* Create a buffer, a DNS packet. 	* in the QNAME, use Message compression (see rfc 4.1.4). Set the  	  pointer to point on another location in the buffer. 	* On this new location set another pointer to point pack to the 	  original QNAME location. In other words, its a circular buffer.  	Dnrd will recurse until the stack is overflowed. 	To reproduce #2 its important to not have any valid digits between the 	loops. It must only contain pointers.  	Impact : crash -> DoS ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=83851#c1)  Pav Lucistnik   freebsd_committer freebsd_triage  2005-07-21 16:43:10 UTC  ``` State Changed From-To: open->closed  Committed, thanks! ``` |  |

Natanael Copa reports that dnrd is vulnerable to a remote
buffer overflow and a remote stack overflow. These
vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending invalid DNS
packets to dnrd.

The buffer overflow could potentially be used to execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the dnrd daemon.
Note that dnrd runs in an chroot environment and runs as
non-root.

The stack overflow vulnerability can cause dnrd to
crash.
