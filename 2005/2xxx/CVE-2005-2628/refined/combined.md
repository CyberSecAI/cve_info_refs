## Macromedia Flash Player fails to properly validate the frame type identifier read from a "SWF" file

#### Vulnerability Note VU#146284

Original Release Date: 2005-11-11 | Last Revised: 2006-05-09

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability in some versions of the Macromedia Flash Player may allow a remote attacker to execute code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Macromedia Flash Player is a player for the Flash media format and enables frame-based animations with sound to be viewed within a web browser.  Some versions of the Flash Player, specifically 7.0.53.0 and earlier, contain an array bounds checking error in the way that they handle a frame type identifier read from the Flash (SWF) file. This error can results in a heap memory access vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. A maliciously crafted SWF that exploits this vulnerability could be supplied through a web page, for example.Note that vulnerable versions of the Flash Player are provided with a number of versions of Microsoft Windows, Apple's Mac OS X, and some distributions of the Linux operating systems. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with the ability to supply a specially crafted SWF file to a vulnerable host may be able to execute arbitrary code on that system. The attacker-supplied code would be executed with the privileges of the user opening the file. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Patches have been released in response to this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more information. |

| **Workarounds**  Microsoft has published a number of workarounds for users of the affected products on Microsoft Windows platforms. Please see the Workarounds section of [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-020](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-020.mspx) for more information. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves publicly reported vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are documented in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin. These vulnerabilities are also documented in [Macromedia Security Bulletin MPSB05-07](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56128) for customers using Flash Player 5 and 6. Customers who have installed Flash Player 7 and higher are advised to download the latest version from the [Adobe website](https://www.macromedia.com/). Customers that have followed the guidance in [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-03](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=62431) are not at risk from the vulnerability.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Is Flash Player a Microsoft technology?**

No. This software is made by Adobe Systems Inc., formerly Macromedia, Inc.

**Is Flash Player redistributed by Microsoft?**

Yes. Some versions of Flash Player have been redistributed by Microsoft. The supported versions of Windows that redistribute Flash Player are Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition and Windows Millennium Edition. No other supported versions of Windows redistribute Flash Player. Other software applications from Microsoft may also redistribute Flash Player.

**Note**: If both flash.ocx and swflash.ocx are present on the system then the GUID used to instantiate the Flash Player should be registered to flash.ocx. Regardless of this, the security update will register the GUID to the new flash.ocx that is installed.

**Which versions of the Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe are redistributed with Windows?**

| Microsoft Windows version | Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe Filenames and Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1 | Swflash.ocx 5.0.44 |
| Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition | Flash.ocx 6.0.79 |
| Microsoft Windows 98 and Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition (SE) | Swflash.ocx 5.0.44 |
| Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (ME) | Swflash.ocx 4.0.28 |

**I use a version of Windows that is not listed in this table. Might I still have the Flash Player installed on my system?**

Yes. Flash Player is available for download from Adobe Systems, Inc. (formerly Macromedia, Inc). Flash Player also may have been installed or required by another software application. You can determine whether you have Flash Player installed and if so what version by visiting the following [Adobe Web site](https://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/). If you have a version of Flash Player earlier than 7.0.63.0 or 8.0.24.0 you have a version that may be affected by the reported vulnerabilities.

The [Adobe Security Bulletin](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=62431) describes the vulnerabilities and provides the download locations so that you can install version 7.0.63.0 or 8.0.24.0 of Flash Player.

**Note** If you do not have Flash Player installed the [Adobe Web site](https://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/) will prompt you to install the latest version of Flash Player.

**I have a Flash Player version earlier than version 7 on my system. What can I do?**

If you are using any of the Windows versions called out in âWhich versions of the Flash Player are redistributed with Windows?â you can visit Windows Update to receive security updates for these versions of Windows. If you use any other supported Windows version, or if you are using Flash Player 7 and higher, you can visit the Adobe download center as called out under the affected software section of the [Adobe security bulletin](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=62431) to install the update

**How does the extended support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition affect the release of security updates for these operating systems?**

Microsoft will only release security updates for critical security issues. Non-critical security issues are not offered during this support period. For more information about the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policies for these operating systems, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33327).

**Note** Support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition (Me) ends on July 11, 2006. For more information, visit the following [Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifean18)

For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities that are addressed in this security bulletin?**

Yes. Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition are critically affected by this vulnerability. The security updates for Flash Player 5.x and 6.x are available for download only from the [Windows Update Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130). Visit the Adobe website for [updates](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=62431) to Flash Player 7 and higher. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 ended on June 30, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a ended on December 31, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 have reached the end of their life cycles. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT 4.0 SP6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 1.2.1 to determine whether this update is required?**

No. MBSA 1.2.1 will not determine whether this update is required. MBSA 1.2.1 will only determine if an update is required for products that MBSA 1.2.1 supports. MBSA 1.2.1 does not support the detection of Flash Player. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about the programs that MBSA 1.2.1 currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). However, Microsoft has developed a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) that will help customers determine if the security updates provided in this security bulletin are required. See the "Can I use a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?" FAQ for more information about this tool.

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For download links and more information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). SMS customers should review the "Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required? " FAQ for more information about SMS and EST.

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 2.0 to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA 2.0 will determine whether this update is required. MBSA 2.0 can detect security updates for products that Microsoft Update supports. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update.

The SMS SUS Feature Pack, which includes the Security Update Inventory Tool (SUIT), can be used by SMS for detecting security updates. SMS SUIT uses the MBSA 1.2.1 engine for detection; therefore, SMS SUIT has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to applications that MBSA does not detect.

For more information about the Security Update Inventory Tool, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/2003/featurepacks/suspack).

The SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates can be used by SMS for detecting security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50757).

SMS 2.0 or SMS 2003 customers that are not using the Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates will need to download and deploy an updated version of the Extended Security Update Inventory Tool in order to receive full detection and deployment for this update.

For more information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Can I use SMS to determine if the Flash Player is installed on a system?**

Yes. SMS can help detect if the Flash Player is installed on a system. SMS can search for the existence of the files flash.ocx and swflash.ocx. Versions of flash.ocx and swflash.ocx that are earlier than version 6.0.80 and all 5.x.x.x versions may be vulnerable.

**Note** If both flash.ocx and swflash.ocx are present on the system then the GUID used to instantiate Flash Player should be registered to flash.ocx. Regardless of this, the security update will register the GUID to the new flash.ocx that is installed.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Flash Player Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0024:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe because of the way that it handles Flash Animation (SWF) files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Flash Animation (SWF) file that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a Web site containing the specially crafted SWF file or viewed an e-mail message containing the specially crafted SWF file as an attachment. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Flash Player Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0024:

* Customers that have followed the guidance in [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-03](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=62431) are not at risk from the vulnerability.
* By default, Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 do not ship with a vulnerable version of Flash Player installed. However, customers that have installed a version of Flash Player 7.0.62.0 or 8.0.22.0 or earlier on these versions of Windows are encouraged to follow the guidance in the [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-03.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=62431)
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario described previously.
  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed.

* **Change your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet security zone and in the Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the following method:

  **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and "\*.update.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the following method:
* **Remove the Flash Player from your system**

  If you want to remove Flash Player, refer to the [Adobe Flash Player Support FAQ](https://www.macromedia.com/go/tn_15511) for instructions.

  To regain functionality you need install the Flash Player ActiveX control from the [Adobe Web](https://www.macromedia.com/) site

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Change Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  Use the following text to create a .reg file to restrict access to the Macromedia Flash folder. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Safer\CodeIdentifiers]
  "TransparentEnabled"=dword:00000002
  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Safer\CodeIdentifiers\0\Paths\{2742f840-c2d8-4eb3-a486-0a9d0879f29f}]

* **Change your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet security zone and in the Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the following method:

  **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and "\*.update.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the following method:
* **Remove Flash Player from your system**

  If you want to remove Flash Player, refer to the [Adobe Flash Player Support FAQ](https://www.macromedia.com/go/tn_15511) for instructions.

  To regain functionality you need install the Flash Player ActiveX control from the [Adobe Web](https://www.macromedia.com/) site

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Macromedia Flash Player: Remote arbitrary code execution — GLSA **200511-21**

A vulnerability has been identified that allows arbitrary code execution on
a user's system via the handling of malicious SWF files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-plugins/adobe-flash** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.0.61** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.0.61** |

### Background

The Macromedia Flash Player is a renderer for the popular SWF
filetype which is commonly used to provide interactive websites,
digital experiences and mobile content.

### Description

When handling a SWF file, the Macromedia Flash Player incorrectly
validates the frame type identifier stored in the SWF file which is
used as an index to reference an array of function pointers. A
specially crafted SWF file can cause this index to reference memory
outside of the scope of the Macromedia Flash Player, which in turn can
cause the Macromedia Flash Player to use unintended memory address(es)
as function pointers.

### Impact

An attacker serving a maliciously crafted SWF file could entice a
user to view the SWF file and execute arbitrary code on the user's
machine.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Macromedia Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-plugins/adobe-flash-7.0.61"
```
