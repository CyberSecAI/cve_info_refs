Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Land Down Under (LDU) forum software. Specifically, it allows users to embed HTML and JavaScript code within their signatures, which are then rendered when other users view their forum posts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically stored XSS. The injected script is stored in the user's signature and executed when other users view posts made by that user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking/Cookie Theft:** An attacker can inject a malicious script (provided in the content) into their signature. When another user (especially an admin as the post indicates) views a forum post by the attacker, the script is executed. This script steals the user's cookies and sends them to the attacker controlled server. This can be used for session hijacking.
- **Arbitrary Actions:** With access to the victim's session, the attacker can perform actions on their behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Signature:** The attacker crafts a signature containing malicious JavaScript code.
- **Forum Post:** The attacker then posts on the forum, causing the malicious signature code to be rendered to other forum users who view that forum post.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Registered user:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the forum software.
- **Ability to modify signature:** The attacker needs the ability to modify their user signature.

The provided content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, including specific example code for the attack and an attacker controlled server used to log the stolen cookies.
