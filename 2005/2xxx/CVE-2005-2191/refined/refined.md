Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `idProduct` parameter in multiple ASP pages is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page. Specifically, the `name` parameter in `comersus_backoffice_listAssignedPricesToCustomer.asp` and the `message` parameter in `comersus_backoffice_message.asp` are vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the `idProduct` parameter in `comersus_optAffiliateRegistrationExec.asp` and `comersus_optReviewReadExec.asp`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code and potentially gain access to sensitive data or modify the database. The error messages reveal the vulnerability exists in `/comersus6/includes/databaseFunctions.asp`, line 39.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks through the `name` parameter in `comersus_backoffice_listAssignedPricesToCustomer.asp` and the `message` parameter in `comersus_backoffice_message.asp`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which can be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL injection could lead to:
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data in the database, including customer information, product details, and administrator credentials.
    *   Modification or deletion of data within the database.
    *   Potential full control over the database server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful XSS attacks could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing user cookies and taking over user sessions).
    *   Website defacement.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code via the `idProduct` URL parameters in the vulnerable ASP pages (`comersus_optAffiliateRegistrationExec.asp` and `comersus_optReviewReadExec.asp`).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code via the `name` parameter in `comersus_backoffice_listAssignedPricesToCustomer.asp` and the `message` parameter in `comersus_backoffice_message.asp` using specially crafted URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web pages, they don't need to be authenticated to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities, however, it is unclear if authentication is needed for the XSS vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes**
* The report mentions that the vendor was contacted, but no reply was received.
* The provided exploit URLs use a Microsoft Access database which is not the most commonly used database, which might indicate that the issue might be less prevalent.
