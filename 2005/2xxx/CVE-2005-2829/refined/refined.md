  "CVE-2005-2829": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer displays file download dialog boxes and accepts user input during interaction with a Web page. This interaction could be in the form of certain keystrokes that a user makes when visiting a Web page. A custom dialog box may also be positioned in front of a file download dialog box to make this more convincing. A user may also be persuaded to double-click an element of a Web page.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way Internet Explorer handles file download dialog boxes and accepts user input during interaction with a webpage, allowing the transfer of user interactions with a webpage to the file download dialog box.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of user input in dialog boxes.",
        "Lack of proper validation of user interactions before executing actions in a dialog box."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Malicious Web page: Attacker hosts a malicious webpage that exploits the vulnerability when a user visits the page.",
          "Social Engineering: An attacker persuades the user to interact with the webpage in a specific way (e.g., keystrokes, double-clicks).",
          "Positioning Custom Dialogs: Overlays a custom dialog box in front of the real file download dialog to make the attack more convincing."
        ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a website that contains malicious code to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker relies on social engineering to persuade the user to visit the website and interact with the content."
