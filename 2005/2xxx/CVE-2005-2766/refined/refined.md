- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition logs the username and password used for connecting to an internal LiveUpdate server in clear text within the `Log.Liveupdate` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cleartext storage of credentials in log files.
    - Log file location is accessible to all users.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Privilege escalation by obtaining credentials of service or domain accounts from log file.
    - Unauthorized access to the Internal LiveUpdate server and potentially other servers in different security zones.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local access to a machine with vulnerable Symantec AntiVirus installation, where the attacker has access to the All Users profile.
    - Reading of the `Log.Liveupdate` file, which is located in a publicly accessible directory (`C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Symantec\LiveUpdate`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Access to the local file system with read permissions for the `Log.Liveupdate` file.
