The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the Dragonfly Shopping Cart application.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Hidden Price Value Vulnerability (HPVV):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application uses hidden form fields (`x_DragonflyCartProductPrice`) to store product prices.
    *   **Weakness:** These hidden fields can be easily modified by the client before submitting the purchase request.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can modify the price of products to an arbitrary value, including zero, allowing them to purchase items at heavily discounted prices or for free.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Modifying the HTML form before submitting it.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Basic understanding of HTML and web form manipulation.

2.  **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SQL code through URL parameters. Examples include:
        *   `/demo/dc_Categoriesview.asp??key='&RecPerPage=5`
        *   `/demo/dc_Categoriesview.asp?key=%26dir%26`
        *   `/demo/dc_productslist_Clearance.asp?cmd=%27`
        *   `/demo/ratings.asp??PID='`
        *   `/demo/dc_forum_Postslist.asp?start='`
        *   `/demo/dc_forum_Postslist.asp?key_m='`
        *   `/demo/dc_forum_Postslist.asp?psearch=1&Submit=Search%20%28%2A%29&psearchtype='`
        *   `/demo/dc_forum_Postslist.asp?psearch='&Submit=Search%20%28%2A%29&psearchtype=1`
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Understanding of SQL syntax and the use of web proxies to modify HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions other hidden fields (like IP addresses) that could be used for attacks, though the impact is not fully explained
*   The advisory includes specific error messages returned by the application due to the exploits which indicate the lack of proper input sanitization, which is a common cause for SQL Injection.

This advisory provides more detail than the typical CVE description would contain, with specific vulnerable URLs, error messages and examples of how to exploit each vulnerability.
