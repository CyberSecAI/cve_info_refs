The provided content relates to CVE-2005-2187.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The McAfee IntruShield Security Management System (MISMS) had vulnerabilities stemming from insecure handling of URL parameters and lack of proper access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **HTML Injection:** The system was vulnerable to HTML injection through URL parameters. Specifically, the `thirdMenuName` parameter in `SystemEvent.jsp` could be manipulated to inject arbitrary HTML code.
2.  **JavaScript Injection:** Similar to HTML injection, the system allowed embedding of JavaScript code within the `resourceName` parameter in `SystemEvent.jsp`.
3.  **Privilege Escalation (Accessing Restricted Reports):** Non-privileged users could access restricted reports by manipulating the `fullAccessRight` parameter in `reports-column-center.jsp` from `false` to `true`.
4.  **Privilege Escalation (Alert Manipulation):** Non-privileged users could acknowledge, de-acknowledge, and delete alerts by changing the `fullAccess` parameter in `SystemEvent.jsp` from `false` to `true`.
5.  **User ID Brute Forcing:** User IDs were passed in clear text in URLs, making it trivial to brute-force accounts to find privileged manager accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTML Injection:** Phishing attacks against valid manager accounts could be performed.
*   **JavaScript Injection:** Malicious scripts could be executed in the security context of the user, leading to potential session hijacking or other malicious activities (e.g., cookie theft, login page manipulation).
*   **Accessing Privileged Reports:** Unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive configuration information about the IP devices.
*   **Alert Manipulation:** Unauthorized users could tamper with alerts, including acknowledging, deleting, or de-acknowledging them which can impact security incident response.
*   **Gaining Access to Management Console:** Attackers could brute-force user IDs to gain access to privileged accounts, giving them full control over the MISMS.
*   **Account hijacking:** By using JavaScript injection, the attacker can create a fake login form to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities by crafting malicious URLs and sending them to users or by directly accessing the vulnerable pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For HTML/JavaScript injection, accessing privileged reports, and alert manipulation, the attacker needed a valid user account on the MISMS.
*   For brute-forcing user IDs, an attacker would need network access to the MISMS server.
