  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of specially crafted IPv6 packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cisco IOS IPv6 packet handling is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack and may potentially be vulnerable to a flaw that allows arbitrary code execution."

    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker on the local network segment may be able to crash or take control of the device running IOS. This includes denial-of-service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted IPv6 packets sent from the local network segment."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be on the local network segment and be able to craft and send arbitrary IPv6 packets."
  },
  "additional_notes": "Only devices configured to handle IPv6 traffic are vulnerable. Packets sent from outside the local network will not affect the device."
