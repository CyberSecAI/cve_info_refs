Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details**
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `prod.php` file in Zorum 3.5. The script uses the `system()` function with user-supplied input from the `argv[1]` parameter without proper sanitization. Specifically, the script takes the value of `$argv[1]`  and uses it in a `mkdir` command, making it vulnerable to command injection.
*   **Weakness:** Command injection vulnerability in the `prod.php` script due to insecure use of the `system()` function with unsanitized user input.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to:
    *   Viewing sensitive files like configuration files (e.g., `config.php`) containing database credentials.
    *   Accessing system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    *   Modifying or deleting server files.
    *   Gaining full control of the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `prod.php` script, including a malicious command in the `argv[1]` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability, making it remotely exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit code also includes proxy support.
*   The exploit code attempts to bypass some security measures using settings like `allow_call_time_pass_reference = on` and `register_globals = on`.
*   The information also details potential path disclosure vulnerabilities via various PHP files, revealing the file structure of the Zorum installation which may aid further exploitation.
