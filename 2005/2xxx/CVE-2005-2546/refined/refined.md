Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `admin.php` script of Arab Portal v2.0 beta 2. The application limits the size of the username and password fields to 20 characters. When the user enters more than 20 characters in these fields, it triggers a PHP error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Lack of input validation:** The application does not properly validate the length of user-provided input for the username and password fields before passing it to subsequent functions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The application outputs a PHP error message that includes the full file path. This can expose sensitive information about the server's directory structure and potentially the web application structure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can trigger the error and gain information about the server's file paths. This information can be used in further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web interface by submitting an overly long username or password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker only needs to be able to access the login page of the Arab Portal.
*   No special privileges are required.
*   The attacker needs to supply the targeted field a string that exceeds 20 characters.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided content also references an "exploit," which is simply the URL of the login page: `<http://www.victim.com/forum/admin/index.php>`. This is the page where the vulnerable username and password fields are located.
*   The error message indicates a call to `errmsg()`, but this function is not defined, indicating a potential flaw in error handling.
*  The message also mentions that "ARAB PORTAL is powerful nuke designed by arabian programmers".
*  The message includes  HTML code segments for input fields.
