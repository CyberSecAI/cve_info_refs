- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `lockmail` program in maildrop does not drop group privileges before executing commands provided on the command line.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing privilege release. Specifically, the program fails to drop group privileges before executing commands, leading to the execution of commands with the group mail privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with group mail privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation through the command line interface of `lockmail`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute commands using the `lockmail` program.
