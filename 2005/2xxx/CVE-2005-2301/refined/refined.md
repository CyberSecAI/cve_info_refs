Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerabilities addressed in PowerDNS 2.9.18:

**Vulnerability 1 (LDAP Backend):**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper escaping of queries in the LDAP backend.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input sanitization/escaping when constructing LDAP queries. This can cause queries to fail.
*   **Impact:** The primary impact described is that queries can fail leading to PowerDNS not answering DNS questions. The advisory also mentions there might be further risks.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending specifically crafted DNS queries that, when processed by the LDAP backend, result in invalid LDAP queries.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be able to send DNS queries to a PowerDNS server configured to use the LDAP backend.

**Vulnerability 2 (Recursion):**

*   **Root Cause:**  When a client denied recursion sent a query, it could temporarily blank out answers for clients that *were* allowed recursion.
*   **Weakness:** Logic flaw in how recursion permissions are applied, leading to temporary denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  A temporary denial of service (DoS) where authorized users would receive SERVFAIL or Refused responses for a domain, instead of actual DNS data. It's noted that PowerDNS would not give a denial of existence.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a DNS query from a client that is *not* allowed recursion, targeting a domain for which legitimate clients *are* allowed recursion.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to send a specific type of DNS query from a source not allowed recursion, while a legitimate user is also querying the same server.

**Summary of Findings:**
The content provides more detail than a standard CVE description, outlining specific vulnerabilities within the PowerDNS software and the potential impacts. The advisory explicitly mentions that both issues are fixed in version 2.9.18.
