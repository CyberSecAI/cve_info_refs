Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Oracle Forms Builder 9.0.4 creates temporary files in the local temp directory (%TEMP%). These files contain the username and password of the current database connection.
*   These temporary files are not deleted after closing the Forms Builder application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of database credentials (username and password) through temporary files.
*   **Insecure Storage:** Passwords are stored in cleartext within the temporary HTML files.
*   **Lack of Cleanup:** The application fails to remove temporary files containing sensitive information after use, leaving them accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains access to the temporary directory could obtain database usernames and passwords, which can then be used to compromise the database.
*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could lead to a data breach if an attacker uses the stolen credentials to access and exfiltrate data from the database.
*   **Compromise of Other Systems:** If the compromised user accounts have access to other systems or resources, the attacker could gain additional access and escalate the attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Access:** An attacker would need to gain access to the local file system of a machine where Oracle Forms Builder 9.0.4 is running and to the temp directory. This could happen through various means like malware or direct access to the machine.
*   **Unprotected Temp Directory:** If the temp directory is not properly secured, this increases the chance of exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local file system access to the target machine.
*   **Knowledge of Temp Directory:** The attacker needs to know the location of the temp directory (typically %TEMP% on Windows).
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to access the temporary files after they are created by the Forms Builder, but before they are cleaned up (if a cleanup process is in place).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 9.0.4 to mitigate a different issue (cleartext passwords in Apache log files). This highlights the challenge of addressing vulnerabilities where one fix might introduce another issue.
*   The advisory mentions that Oracle was informed of the issue on 14-Feb-2005, and they released a patch in July 2005.
*   A workaround was suggested to set the environment variables TMP, TEMP and TMPDIR to a secure location and to regularly clean up the temp directory.
