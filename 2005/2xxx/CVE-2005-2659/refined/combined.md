How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Subject:** CVS commit: pkgsrc/devel/chmlib

**To:** None *<pkgsrc-changes@NetBSD.org>*

**From:** Min Sik Kim *<minskim@netbsd.org>*

**List:** pkgsrc-changes

**Date:** 09/12/2005 14:49:10
```
Module Name:	pkgsrc
Committed By:	minskim
Date:		Mon Sep 12 14:49:10 UTC 2005

Modified Files:
	pkgsrc/devel/chmlib: Makefile buildlink3.mk distinfo
	pkgsrc/devel/chmlib/patches: patch-aa

Log Message:
Update chmlib to 0.36.  This version includes two security fixes.

Changes:
    - Major security fix (iDEFENSE Security Advisory IDEF1099 - Stack Overflow
      Vulnerability)
    - Major security fix from Palasik Sandor (LZX decompression buffer overrun)
    - Bugfix/enhancement from David Huseby to make the "what" flags to
      chm_enumerate work correctly, and to pass the flags along to the callback
      function (via the chmUnitInfo structure) so that the callback doesn't
      need to re-parse the filename.
    - Compilation fixes for x86-64 from Vitaly V. Bursov.
    - Miscellaneous fixes to the configure script, including some significant
      cleanup by Vadim Zeitlin.  The changes from Vadim should also allow the
      configure script to correctly configure the build on OS X, where it was
      previously failing to note that pread64 doesn't work.
    - Minor update to the Makefile.in to do a mkdir before the install, in case
      the specified INSTALLPREFIX directory is non-existent

Package        : chmlib
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-2659 CVE-2005-2930 CVE-2005-3318
BugTraq ID     : 15211

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in chmlib, a library for
dealing with CHM format files.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-2659

    Palasik Sandor discoverd a buffer overflow in the LZX
    decompression method.

CVE-2005-2930

    A buffer overflow has been discovered that could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2005-3318

    Sven Tantau discoverd a buffer overflow that could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain chmlib packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.35-6sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.37-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your chmlib packages.
