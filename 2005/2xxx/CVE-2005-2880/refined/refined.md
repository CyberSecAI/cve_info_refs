The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in phpCommunityCalendar 4.0.3 and possibly prior versions, as reported by retrogod. These include SQL injection, login bypass, and cross-site scripting (XSS) issues.

**1) SQL Injection / Login Bypass:**
   - **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization in the login process for category administrators. When magic quotes are off, the application fails to properly escape user-provided input.
   - **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability in the login mechanism located at `webadmin/login.php`.
   - **Impact:** Attackers can bypass authentication as a category admin and gain unauthorized access to add, delete, and modify events.
   - **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious SQL query using the login field, an attacker can manipulate the SQL statement to bypass the intended authentication mechanism. For example, using `' or isnull(1/0) /*` as the username and leaving the password field empty.
   - **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the login page with manipulated POST parameters. The target server must have `magic_quotes_gpc` disabled.

**2) SQL Injection:**
   - **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `LocationID` parameter.
   - **Weakness:**  SQL injection vulnerability in the `week.php` script.
   - **Impact:**  Potentially allows arbitrary SQL queries to be executed on the database.
   - **Attack Vector:** Modifying the `LocationID` parameter in the URL, such as `http://[target]/[path]/week.php?LocationID=-1'[INJECTION]%20/*`
   - **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to send crafted HTTP GET requests to `week.php` with a modified `LocationID`.

**3) Admin Directory Access:**
   - **Root Cause:** The "admin" directory is not consistently protected via `.htaccess` or other means.
   - **Weakness:** Lack of proper access control for the `admin` directory.
   - **Impact:** An attacker can access the main admin control panel if the directory is not password-protected.
   - **Attack Vector:** Accessing the `/admin/` directory directly via a web browser.
   - **Required Capabilities:** Simple access to a vulnerable installation through HTTP requests.

**4) Cross Site Scripting (XSS):**
   - **Root Cause:** Inadequate sanitization of user-provided input before rendering it in HTML context.
   - **Weakness:**  XSS vulnerability exists in multiple PHP pages, where unsanitized input is reflected in the HTML output, allowing the execution of JavaScript code.
   - **Impact:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, and other malicious actions.
    - **Attack Vector:** Injection of malicious JavaScript through multiple parameters, including event fields and URL parameters like `font`, `LocationID`, `CeTi`, `Contact`, `Description`, and `ShowAddress`. Examples include using payloads like `\');</script><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` and `"><script>alert('LOL')</script>`.
   - **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to craft malicious payloads in the URL parameters or event fields, then convince a user to view the page or submit a crafted event with the malicious input.

**Vulnerable URLs:**
   - `webadmin/login.php`
   - `week.php`
   - `admin/`
   - `thankyou.php`
   - `calDaily.php`
   - `calMonthly.php`
   - `calMonthlyP.php`
   - `calWeekly.php`
   - `calWeeklyP.php`
   - `calYearly.php`
   - `calYearlyP.php`
   - `day.php`
   - `event.php`
