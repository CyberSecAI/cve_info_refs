Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Insecure temporary file creation within the Skype for Linux application when a user adds a profile picture.
- The application creates a file named `/tmp/skype_profile.jpg` without properly checking for the existence of the file or if it's a symbolic link, using `O_CREAT` without `O_EXCL` or `O_NOFOLLOW`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The program creates a temporary file in a world-writable directory `/tmp` without proper checks and using insecure creation flags
- **Symlink Vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows for a symlink attack by a malicious local user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local attacker can create a symbolic link at `/tmp/skype_profile.jpg` pointing to a file they wish to overwrite. When the Skype user updates their profile picture, the chosen picture will overwrite the target file, with the privileges of the Skype user.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** In some specific conditions, such as the case when the user is root or if the user is running with elevated privileges, this vulnerability can be exploited to escalate privileges, by overwriting files related to authentication (e.g., `/var/run/sudo`). This could lead to an attacker bypassing authentication mechanisms and gaining unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access Required:** The attacker must have local access to the system where Skype for Linux is running.
- **Symlink Creation:** The attacker creates a symbolic link in the `/tmp` directory pointing to the target file to be overwritten.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
- The attacker also needs to be able to predict or know when the victim user will update their Skype profile picture.
