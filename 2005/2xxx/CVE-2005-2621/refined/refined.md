Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in ECW Shop 6.0.2:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when generating the HTML page.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding allows injection of malicious scripts.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or other malicious actions when a user visits the manipulated page.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `key` parameter in the URL.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick a user into accessing it.
2.  **Information Disclosure & Possible SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly handle single quote characters (`'`) in the `min` and `max` parameters, causing an error message that includes potentially sensitive information about the system.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation and error handling, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.
    *   **Impact:**  The error message reveals information about the application's structure and database. While SQL injection is not confirmed, the vulnerability could be exploited to retrieve sensitive data or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `min` and `max` parameters in the URL using single quotes.
     *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker can craft a malicious URL to trigger the error.
3.  **HTML Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize HTML tags in the `ctg` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization allowing injection of arbitrary HTML code.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code into the web page, potentially defacing the website or displaying malicious content.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `ctg` parameter in the URL to inject HTML code.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick a user into accessing it.

4. **Cart/Order Manipulation:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows negative values to be entered as the quantity of items in the cart.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation of quantity values during cart operations.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can add negative quantity items to the cart, effectively giving themselves a credit that they can use to reduce the cost of their order. This can result in financial losses for the online shop.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Modifying the quantity of items during the cart checkout process.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application's shopping cart functionality.

**Summary:**

The identified vulnerabilities in ECW Shop 6.0.2 include XSS, information disclosure potentially leading to SQL injection, HTML injection, and cart manipulation. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious code, disclose sensitive data, deface the website or manipulate order totals. The vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of proper input validation, output sanitization, and insufficient error handling by the application, as well as not validating the integrity of data in the shopping cart.
