Summary:

Covide, a webbased groupware application has had a problem where it was possible to inject
sql due to special crafted urls. This made it possible to change the user id once logged in.

Solution provided to the authors:

Type cast the queries where possible and check user input to see if it is what
is expected.

Contacted the authors on June the 5th 2005. Havn't had a reply yet, although the cvs shows
that they are working on a fix. A session user id is now being used instead of
a user id which was fetched global.

Hans Wolters
