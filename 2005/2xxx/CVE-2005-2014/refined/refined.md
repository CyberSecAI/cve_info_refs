Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2005-2014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The primary root cause is the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries and outputting it to web pages. This allows for multiple vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Insecure Database Access:** The `backup.php` script allows unauthenticated users to download the entire database, including sensitive information such as password hashes.
*  **Insecure Language Pack Upload:** The language pack upload feature does not adequately check the uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Inputted variables are not sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page which can disclose sensitive information like cookies.
*   **SQL Injection:** Vulnerable SQL queries, particularly within the administrative login process and the "id" parameter in multiple scripts, can be exploited to bypass authentication, access or manipulate database information.  The vulnerability is exacerbated when `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled.
*   **Arbitrary Database Download:** The `backup.php` script allows for downloading the entire database without authentication.
*   **Admin Authentication Bypass:**  SQL injection in the login process allows an attacker to log in as an administrator by crafting a malicious username. Also, the downloaded database's password hashes can be used to gain admin access by setting appropriate cookies.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  After gaining admin access, a malicious language pack (e.g., a modified `en.php` with a `passthru()` function) can be uploaded to achieve remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can steal sensitive information such as user cookies, password hashes, and the entire database.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the application.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the webserver, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** By combining the vulnerabilities, an attacker can gain a remote shell and fully compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Vulnerabilities are exploited via specially crafted HTTP requests to the application's web pages.
*   **Malicious Language Pack Upload:**  After gaining admin access, an attacker can upload a modified language pack that contains malicious PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:**  The attacker needs an understanding of HTTP requests, SQL syntax, and web application vulnerabilities.
*   **No Authentication Required (for some vulnerabilities):**  The database download vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
*   **Administrative Access (for some vulnerabilities):** The arbitrary code execution requires administrative access, achievable through other vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Perl script (`pafaq.pl`) demonstrates an automated method for exploiting some of these vulnerabilities, specifically the database download and adding an admin user by setting cookies.
*   The vendor did not respond to the vulnerability report.
*   A temporary workaround suggested was to delete `backup.php` and enable `magic_quotes_gpc` (though it's noted that disabling `magic_quotes_gpc` is the default php.ini setting).
