The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in FunkBoard V0.66CF and possibly prior versions.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple parameters across various PHP files (editpost.php, prefs.php, newtopic.php, reply.php, profile.php, register.php) are vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
    *  **Attack Vectors:**  By crafting specific URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads injected into vulnerable parameters (e.g., `fbusername`, `fbpassword`, `subject`, `fmail`, etc.).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to craft URLs and convince a user to click the malicious link or visit the infected page.

2.  **Path Disclosure:** The file `images/forums.php` discloses the server's full file path when accessed.
    *   **Root Cause:** The application displays the full server path of the file within the error message.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper error handling or sanitization of output.
    *   **Impact:** Can aid attackers in understanding the system structure.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Accessing the file directly via a web browser.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Basic web browsing capabilities.

3.  **Database Username & Password Disclosure:** The installation scripts `mysql_install.php` and `pg_install.php` are not automatically deleted after installation.
    *   **Root Cause:** The installation script is not removed after installation is complete.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Improper cleanup of install files.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can access these files and retrieve the database username and password stored in plaintext, potentially leading to a full compromise of the database. Additionally, an attacker could overwrite the database configuration using the install script.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Accessing the installation scripts directly via a web browser.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Basic web browsing capabilities.

4.  **Remote Code Execution:** Through the `mysql_install.php` file, an attacker can inject PHP code into the configuration file `info.php`.
    *   **Root Cause:** The installation script `mysql_install.php` does not sanitize the email field, allowing the injection of arbitrary PHP code, which is later written to the `info.php` file
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, insecure file writing practices.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by accessing the generated `info.php` file with a `command` parameter. This gives them full control over the server.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** First accessing the vulnerable install script, injecting malicious PHP code, and then accessing the `info.php` to execute the injected commands.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to craft a POST request to `mysql_install.php` and access to the generated `info.php` file

The content also includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit in PHP that demonstrates the remote code execution vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
Funkboard v0.70 was released to address these security issues.
