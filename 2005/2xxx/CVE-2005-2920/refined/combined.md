How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Clam AntiVirus contains a buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#363713

Original Release Date: 2005-09-27 | Last Revised: 2005-11-03

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Clam AntiVirus is a UNIX-based, anti-virus toolkit often deployed with mail servers to detect malicious attachments. A signedness error in ClamAV (libclamav/upx.c) may allow a buffer overflow to occur. If a remote attacker sends a specially crafted [UPX](http://www.upx.org/)-packed executable to a vulnerable ClamAV installation, that attacker may be able to trigger the buffer overflow. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application linked to the ClamAV process. In addition, this vulnerability may prevent ClamAV from detecting malicious UPX-packed executables. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  This issue was corrected in [ClamAV 0.87](http://www.clamav.net/stable.php#pagestart). |
| --- |

| **Do not access UPX-packed executables from untrusted sources**Exploitation occurs by via specially crafted UPX-packed executables. By only accessing UPX-packed executables from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. |

# Clam AntiVirus: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200509-13**

Clam AntiVirus is subject to vulnerabilities ranging from Denial of Service
to execution of arbitrary code when handling compressed executables.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.87** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.87** |

### Background

Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit, designed for
integration with mail servers to perform attachment scanning. Clam
AntiVirus also provides a command line scanner and a tool for fetching
updates of the virus database.

### Description

Clam AntiVirus is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in
"libclamav/upx.c" when processing malformed UPX-packed executables. It
can also be sent into an infinite loop in "libclamav/fsg.c" when
processing specially-crafted FSG-packed executables.

### Impact

By sending a specially-crafted file an attacker could execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Clam AntiVirus,
or cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Clam AntiVirus users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.87"
```

Package        : clamav
Vulnerability  : infinite loop, buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2919 CAN-2005-2920
Debian Bug     : 328660

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in Clam AntiVirus, the
antivirus scanner for Unix, designed for integration with mail servers
to perform attachment scanning.  The following problems were
identified:

CAN-2005-2919

    A potentially infinite loop could lead to a denial of service.

CAN-2005-2920

    A buffer overflow could lead to a denial of service.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain ClamAV packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.4.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.87-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
