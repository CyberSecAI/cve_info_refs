  "CVE-2005-2920": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) when processing malformed UPX-packed executables. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "A signedness error in the `libclamav/upx.c` component of ClamAV can lead to a buffer overflow.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Buffer Overflow: A specially crafted UPX-packed executable can trigger a buffer overflow due to a signedness error."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using the ClamAV library. Additionally, the vulnerability can prevent ClamAV from detecting malicious UPX-packed executables.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote: By sending a specially crafted UPX-packed executable to a vulnerable ClamAV installation, a remote attacker can trigger the buffer overflow."
      ],
     "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious UPX-packed executable to a system using a vulnerable version of ClamAV."
      ]
