The provided content is related to CVE-2005-2250.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Bluetooth FTP client of the `affix` package. This is triggered by a long filename during an OBEX file share operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow: The software does not properly validate the length of the filename received during an OBEX file share, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is triggered over the network via the Bluetooth protocol when sharing files using OBEX.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote: The attacker needs to be in a position to send Bluetooth OBEX file share requests to the target system.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable service: The attacker must be aware of the specific service and protocol (Bluetooth FTP using OBEX) to exploit this vulnerability.
