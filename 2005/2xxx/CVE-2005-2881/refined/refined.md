The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in phpCommunityCalendar 4.0.3 and possibly earlier versions.

**1) SQL Injection / Login Bypass:**
   - **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user input in the `webadmin/login.php` file when magic quotes are disabled.
   - **Weaknesses:** SQL injection vulnerability, lack of proper input sanitization/validation.
   - **Impact:** Allows unauthorized access to category administration tools. An attacker can bypass the login system using a crafted SQL injection.
   - **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted username (e.g., `' or isnull(1/0) /*`) in the login form.
   - **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker must have knowledge of the SQL injection vulnerability and be able to access the login page.

**2) SQL Injection:**
   - **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user input in `week.php` when processing the `LocationID` parameter.
   - **Weaknesses:** SQL injection vulnerability, lack of proper input sanitization/validation.
   - **Impact:** Allows an attacker to potentially manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application. This could lead to data retrieval, modification, or deletion, depending on the database permissions and application code.
   - **Attack Vector:** By injecting SQL code into the `LocationID` parameter in the `week.php` URL (e.g., `http://[target]/[path]/week.php?LocationID=-1'[INJECTION]%20/*`).
   - **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must have knowledge of the SQL injection vulnerability and be able to modify the `LocationID` parameter.

**3) Insecure admin directory:**
   - **Root Cause:** Lack of proper access control for the `admin` directory, which should be password-protected by `.htaccess`.
   - **Weaknesses:** Inadequate access control, insecure configuration of the web server.
   - **Impact:** Allows unauthorized access to the main administrator control panel.
   - **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the `admin/` directory (`http://[target]/[path]/admin/`).
    - **Required Capabilities:** The attacker only needs to know the path of the admin directory and have access to the web application.

**4) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
   - **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user input when displaying data in various PHP pages.
   - **Weaknesses:** XSS vulnerability, lack of output encoding.
   - **Impact:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which could be executed by other users. This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
   - **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious scripts into various fields when adding an event (e.g., `\'\);</script><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`) or through URL parameters (e.g., `font`, `LocationID`, `CeTi`, `Contact`, `Description`, `ShowAddress`).
   - **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to add events or craft URLs with the malicious javascript payload.
