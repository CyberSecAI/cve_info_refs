- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `config.php` script in Comdev eCommerce 3.0 does not properly validate the `path[docroot]` HTTP request parameter, which is used to specify the location of an included file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Input validation error, specifically an arbitrary file inclusion vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change the location of an included file to a malicious file they control. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP request by manipulating the `path[docroot]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious file on a web server accessible to the vulnerable server.
