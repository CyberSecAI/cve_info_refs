Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2804:

*   **Vulnerability:** Novell GroupWise Client Integer Overflow
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to securely parse the saved port number of the last authentication store in the Windows registry.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of large integer values read from the registry.
*   **Attack Vector:** Modifying the `TCP/IP Port` value within the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Novell\GroupWise\Login Parameters` registry key to a large number (e.g., 11111111111111111111111111111111).

*   **Affected Versions:** GroupWise 6.5.3 and likely all previous versions.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to modify the Windows registry of the target machine.
