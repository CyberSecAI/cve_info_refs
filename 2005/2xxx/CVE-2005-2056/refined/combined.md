## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# Clam AntiVirus: Denial of Service vulnerability — GLSA **200506-23**

Clam AntiVirus is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack when processing
certain Quantum archives.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.86.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.86.1** |

### Background

Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit, designed for integration
with mail servers to perform attachment scanning. Clam AntiVirus also
provides a command line scanner and a tool for fetching updates of the
virus database.

### Description

Andrew Toller and Stefan Kanthak discovered that a flaw in libmspack's
Quantum archive decompressor renders Clam AntiVirus vulnerable to a
Denial of Service attack.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a Denial of
Service by sending a specially crafted Quantum archive to the server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Clam AntiVirus users should upgrade to the latest available
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.86.1"
```

Debian Security Advisory DSA 737-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Michael Stone

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : clamav
Vulnerability  : various DOS vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote DOS
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CAN-2005-1922, CAN-2005-1923, CAN-2005-2056, CAN-2005-2070

A number of potential remote DOS vulnerabilities have been identified in
ClamAV. In addition to the four issues identified by CVE ID above, there
are fixes for issues in libclamav/cvd.c and libclamav/message.c.
Together, these issues could allow a carefully crafted message to crash
a ClamAV scanner or exhaust various resources on the machine running the
scanner.

For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 3.1 (sarge)
- ------------------

  Sarge was released for alpha, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
