Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the failure of Novell Groupwise WebAccess to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in dynamically generated web content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application does not properly validate or encode user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
*   **Theft of Authentication Credentials:**  The injected script can be used to steal authentication credentials such as cookies or session tokens.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** XSS can be used as a stepping stone for more significant attacks, such as defacing websites or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Injection:** An attacker can send a specially crafted email containing malicious HTML code, which, when viewed by the victim in WebAccess, triggers the XSS vulnerability. Specifically, an email containing the following HTML:  `<IMG SRC="j&#X41vascript:alert(document.cookie)">`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send emails to a Groupwise user.** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a user of the vulnerable Groupwise WebAccess system.
*   **No special user privileges needed:** The exploit does not rely on any elevated privileges. The XSS is triggered by the vulnerable application processing user input.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:**  GroupWise 6.5 SP4 is specifically mentioned as vulnerable, and it's suspected that all previous versions of GroupWise WebAccess are also vulnerable.
*   **Vendor Response:** Novell has released an advisory and a patch to address this vulnerability.
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by Francisco Amato of Infobyte Security Research.
