How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Problem type   : remote

BugTraq ID     : 14242

Several problems have been discovered in Mozilla, the we browser of
the Mozilla suite.  Since the usual praxis of backporting apparently
does not work for this package, this update is basically version
1.7.10 with the version number rolled back, and hence still named
1.7.8.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CAN-2004-0718, CAN-2005-1937

    A vulnerability has been discovered in Mozilla that allows remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary Javascript from one page into the
    frameset of another site.

CAN-2005-2260

    The browser user interface does not properly distinguish between
    user-generated events and untrusted synthetic events, which makes
    it easier for remote attackers to perform dangerous actions that
    normally could only be performed manually by the user.

CAN-2005-2261

    XML scripts ran even when Javascript disabled.

CAN-2005-2263

    It is possible for a remote attacker to execute a callback
    function in the context of another domain (i.e. frame).

CAN-2005-2265

    Missing input sanitising of InstallVersion.compareTo() can cause
    the application to crash.

CAN-2005-2266

    Remote attackers could steal sensitive information such as cookies
    and passwords from web sites by accessing data in alien frames.

CAN-2005-2268

    It is possible for a Javascript dialog box to spoof a dialog box
    from a trusted site and facilitates phishing attacks.

CAN-2005-2269

    Remote attackers could modify certain tag properties of DOM nodes
    that could lead to the execution of arbitrary script or code.

CAN-2005-2270

    The Mozilla browser familie does not properly clone base objects,
    which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.8-1sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your Mozilla packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Solution:**
 - Do not browse untrusted web sites when browsing trusted sites.

 Workarounds provided by the
researcher:
 - 1. Check the URL address opening new dialog box titled as 'Explorer User Prompt' and
containing text like 'Script Prompt' etc. If the domain contains multiple domain suffixes, for example
www.real-address.com.non-real-address.com, use the following workaround method:
 - 2. When typing
sensitive information to a Web site password-type dialog boxes, be sure that this site is a legitimate
site.
 ***Update:*** Use special security features included to some browsers,
IP-URL Checker etc. to resolve the origin of the Web page. Use popup blocker in some situations.
 Move
the JavaScript dialog box from covering the original URL address at location bar.
 NOTE: Using multiple
domain suffixes may indicate a spoofing attempt.
 In Mozilla-based browsers: Those dialog boxes
mentioned are titled as [JavaScript Application] (Javascript-sovelma in Finnish etc.).

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=289940#c0)• 20 years ago |
|  | |

Right now our chrome code generally excpects its event handlers to be called
onyl from the code that normally fires the events in question, but lots of event
handlers listen for events that can be synthesized by untrusted content, and
we're thus vulnerable to security problems, or at least unexpected code
execution. We have a solution for this problem, and that is to check if the
event in question is trusted or not, but way too often this check is omitted and
it's by now unlikely to expect this problem to be fixable by adding those
checks, and not forgetting those checks in new code etc.
The safer fix for this problem is to simply stop delivering untrusted events to
chrome code. This way, if people forget something related to this, their code
won't work rather than having security problems creep into the code. The
potential problem with this approach is that existing code that does rely on
untrusted events in chrome code is broken by this change. But I think that's
inevitable, and I'm hoping the breakage won't be too broad. Because of this, we
do need an alternate apporach that the code that does indeed need to see
untrusted events from chrome code can use. That will be done by an optional
additional argument to the addEventListener() method that tells whether the
listener wants untrusted events or not. By default content code will get them,
chrome code won't.
The big part of this change is to mark all our internal events as trusted, where
applicable. This will be done by changing the constructors of the various
ns\*Event classes such that the C++ compiler will require you to specify if an
event is trusted or not. Patch coming up (tested only on Win32 and Gtk2 builds
for now).
(marking security sensitive to keep the visibility of this problem down for now)

Couldn't this always be trusted? Even if the focusevent was untrusted we're

Hmm.. is this a problem in general, that 'fake' events can have real effects
that chrome is interested in. Like if a javascript clickevent is dispatched on a
link.

That's a tough one (since the page can just call submit() on the form, which
does a similar but not identical thing).

Have a look at nsEventStateManager::DispatchNewEvent and its caller. I \*think\*
this is already done.

I can't say I'm sure either, but I must say I'd be surprised if this wasn't the
case.

Not really, IMO. No matter how a submit happens, the onsubmit event should be
trusted since it's an event that tells you that we're now submitting, no matter
what triggerd the submit action (i.e. a synthetic click event on a submit button
should fire a trusted onsubmit event, just like calling form.submit() should).

This is IMHO inconsistent. Content calling Reset() will give an untrusted
reset/submit event, but content dispatching a DOMActivate will get a trusted
one. I think I agree that these could be trusted.

I'm probably commenting at completely the wrong time of day, so all I can think
of is that we currently update the status bar with a link's target as it gets
focus (although but we don't clear it when it blurs...)

Shouldn't the code in nsButtonBoxFrame::MouseClicked default to untrusted event
if there is no aEvent. Similar question in other MouseClicked functions.
Dbaron/bz, does MouseClicked (with or without an aEvent argument) ever get
called unless the user actually clicked on the frame using the mouse or through
accessibility interfaces?
Maybe we could use check for js on the stack and make it untrusted unless the
top js is chrome?

hoping we get review overnight and can get this approved on thursday if it
looks good.

In @@ -343,43 +348,48 @@ nsHTMLButtonElement::HandleDOMEvent(nsPr
Should the last event in this block always be trusted? Or should we promote the
event to a trusted one sometime later on if it in fact causes a
submission/reset (does it ever not?).
For the various click functions, I think it might be a good idea to implement a
nsContentUtils::IsCallerNativeOrChrome(). There might be embedders that want to
call these functions.
So is nsEventListenerManager::RegisterScriptEventListener the function that is
called when you set myElem.onfoo = <jscode> ? Please add some documentation
to the headerfile that explains that this function will do a iscallerchrome
check.
r=me with that

silver says nsEvent.h declares nsEvent as a struct. please don't forward declare
it incorrectly, that'll trigger a warning.

Yeha, w/o the casts I get:
../../../../mozilla/content/events/src/nsDOMUIEvent.cpp:58: error: conditional
expression between distinct pointer types `nsGUIEvent\*' and `nsUIEvent\*'
lacks a cast
Fixed the rest, including sickings latest findings (except the
nsHTMLLableElement case which we decided should remain as is).

I've completed the patch and incorporated [bug 292326](/show_bug.cgi?id=292326 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arrowscrollbox doesn't scroll on hover") and [bug 292464](/show_bug.cgi?id=292464 "RESOLVED FIXED - event listeners added using addEventListener() listen only trusted events") (295210 was
checked in independently). I'm not attaching it because it doesn't actually work
-- the "blocked" bugs are still exploitable on the branch, for example. Diffing
against the trunk now to see what I flipped the wrong way. Could be my
replacement for the trunk's GetOwnerDoc() was wrong :-( (nsGenericElement and a
couple others).

Found the missing lines doing a careful diff of diffs between the trunk and

be able to just copy that from the trunk).

Thanks.

This patched disabled ability the catch to key events and changing them to
another one, which as I far as I know can only be done using initkeyevent, check
the second example on this page:
<http://www.pooyak.com/blog/archives/000146.shtml>
I know that this is something that potentially can cause many security problems
but at the same time it is something very useful for web application. For
example a popular usage is to make the tab key working in a text area, as I did
on the edit page of Uniwakka, a scientific Wiki. I remember the old version of
Yahoo Mail also had functionality (IE Only), but I couldn’t find a reference to
it. There tab is used for indentation:
<http://www.istitutocolli.org/uniwakka/SandBox/edit>
I also use that to port a popular script for changing the keyboard layout to
Firefox. This script allows users to type in Persian language in text inputs
without having any special software installed. The IE version of it is very
popular in Persian community:
<http://www.pooyak.com/p/persianjavascript/>
In Internet Explorer it is done by either changing keyCode property of the event
(which as I remember is read-only in Mozilla) or using some IE specific text
selection functions to find the cursor position and put the new character there.
I'm looking forward either for getting back this functionality or knowing
alternate solutions to it.
Thanks

This vulnerability permits a malicious website to inject a "frame" into the browser window of another website. For example, the content from <http://www.malicious.com> can be loaded into another window displaying the content from <http://www.mybank.com>. The flaw can be exploited by a malicious webpage to spoof its identity as a trusted site. This may lead to stealing sensitive user information such as passwords, or further compromise of the user system. Proof-of-concept browser test tools have been publicly posted.

Those patches are pretty small, and deal with one C source file and its header file.  I was thinking about cloning this bug and posting the spec-file and patches in the cloned bug, so we can issue packages that fix the Mozilla- Mail bugs...  Would it be appropriate to do so?  Or should I post them here in this bug? Or not do it at all?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=160202#c16)  Pekka Savola    2005-08-30 18:37:31 UTC  ``` I don't think we should respin the packages for this.

See, for example, <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-769.html>. One more additional patch, named firefox-307259-branch.patch in mozilla-1.7.10-1.1.3.2.src.rpm, is needed to close that hole.  The same patch is also used in mozilla-1.7.10-1.3.2.src.rpm from FC3 updates and mozilla recompiles after adding it without any issues (at least on an RH7.3 installation).  Resulting binaries work or you are not reading that. :-)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=160202#c19)  Pekka Savola    2005-09-10 18:43:50 UTC  ``` Hmm.. not sure if we can add it at that point (this update is pending release in any case).  Maybe someone would need to create new packages (e.g., based on 1.7.11) which incorporate that patch under a new PR number?   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=160202#c20)  Marc Deslauriers    2005-09-15 02:02:09 UTC  ``` Packages were released to updates.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-45

## Content-generated event vulnerabilities

Announced
July 12, 2005
Reporter
Omar Khan, Jochen, shutdown, Matthew Mastracci
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.5
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.10

### Description

In several places the browser UI did not correctly distinguish between true
user events, such as mouse clicks or keystrokes, and synthetic events
genenerated by web content. The problems ranged from minor annoyances like
switching tabs or entering full-screen mode, to a variant on [MFSA 2005-34](mfsa2005-34.html)

Synthetic events are now prevented from reaching the browser UI entirely
rather than depend on each potentially spoofed function to protect
itself from untrusted events.
