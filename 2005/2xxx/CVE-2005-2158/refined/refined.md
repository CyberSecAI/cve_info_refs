The provided content describes two vulnerabilities affecting JBoss jBPM 2.0. Only the first vulnerability relates to CVE-2005-2158.

**Vulnerability 1: Remote Code Execution**

*   **Root Cause:** A vulnerability in the embedded HSQLDB of JBoss 3.2.x allows for remote code execution. This is a regression bug from JBoss 3.2.1 that was fixed in JBoss 3.2.2.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The HSQLDB database exposes functionality that can be abused to execute arbitrary commands on the server. Specifically, this involves using `CREATE ALIAS` to map Java methods to database functions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the JBoss/jBPM host with the access control rights of the JBoss process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted SQL statements to the HSQLDB instance via JDBC.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the HSQLDB port (default 1701) and must be able to make JDBC connections to it.

**Technical details:**

The provided ant script demonstrates the vulnerability by creating aliases for Java methods within the HSQL database and then calling them:
* `CREATE ALIAS COMPDEBUG FOR "org.apache.xml.utils.synthetic.JavaUtils.setDebug"` creates an alias to enable debug mode.
* `CREATE ALIAS SETPROP FOR "java.lang.System.setProperty"` creates an alias to set a system property.
* `CREATE ALIAS COMPILE FOR "org.apache.xml.utils.synthetic.JavaUtils.JDKcompile"` creates an alias that compiles and executes java code, allowing command execution.

The exploit sets the `org.apache.xml.utils.synthetic.javac` property to `cmd.exe` and then calls the `COMPILE` alias with the command `/c REGEDIT.EXE`, which results in the execution of `REGEDIT.EXE` on the server.

**Vulnerability 2: JBoss class loader covert channel**

*   This vulnerability is not related to CVE-2005-2158. It relates to information disclosure and is described in a previous bugtraq posting.
*   It involves an information leak in the `org.jboss.web.WebServer` class, which reveals system platform information through crafted HTTP requests (e.g., "GET %.").
*   The RMI class download service on port 8083 also allows version fingerprinting.

This vulnerability is not part of the CVE description.
