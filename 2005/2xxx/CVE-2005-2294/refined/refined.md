Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-2294 (though this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, the content describes the vulnerability referenced by the CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- When an Oracle Forms application retrieves more records than specified by the "buffered records" parameter, it creates a temporary file in the application server's temp directory. This file contains an unencrypted copy of the database table used in the Forms application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** Oracle Forms creates temporary files containing sensitive database data without encryption.
-   **Inadequate File Permissions:**  The temporary files are created with default permissions that allow any user on the application server to read their contents (e.g., `rw-rw-r--`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers with access to the application server can read the temporary files and gain access to sensitive data, such as credit card information, user data, etc., present in the database table.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the application server's filesystem to read the insecurely created temp files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must have a valid user account on the application server with the ability to read files in the temp directory.

**Additional Details:**
- The temporary files have a format like `AAAa.TMP`.
- The issue affects Oracle Forms versions 4.5, 6.0, 6i, and 9i.
- The advisory was published by Red-Database-Security on July 13, 2005.
- The vendor, Oracle, was informed of the vulnerability on Aug 19, 2003, confirmed on Aug 20, 2003, and addressed it in the Oracle Critical Patch Update July 2005 released July 12, 2005 (Metalink Note 311038)
- Workaround: Setting environment variables TMP, TEMP, and TMPDIR to a secure location and deleting old temporary files regularly is suggested.
