The provided content describes a vulnerability related to insecure temporary file creation in `ncompress`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insecure temporary file creation within `ncompress`. The `ncompress` utility uses vulnerable versions of `zdiff` and `zcmp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure temporary file creation leading to a symlink attack vulnerability.
- Race condition when creating temporary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file creation and overwriting with the privileges of the user running the affected script.

**Attack vectors:**
- Symlink attacks in combination with a race condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create symlinks in a directory where the vulnerable `ncompress` utility creates temporary files.
- Ability to trigger the execution of the vulnerable `ncompress` utility.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `ncompress` version 4.2.4-r1 and earlier.
- A related Secunia advisory is available at: `http://secunia.com/advisories/13131/`
- The vulnerability is also related to `CAN-2004-0970`.
- The exploit is available, but the impact and exploitation are described as low.
- A suggested solution is to apply a kernel patch such as `grsecurity` to prevent symlink attacks.
