Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Trillian instant messaging client stores Yahoo! Mail passwords in plaintext within a temporary cache file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Plaintext Storage:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of user passwords in clear text, which is easily readable by anyone with access to the file.
    *   **World-Readable File:** The temporary file created containing the password has world-readable permissions, allowing any user on the system to view the password.
    *   **Lack of Deletion:** The temporary file is not deleted after the email check is completed or when the user logs out. It persists until the application is closed, creating a significant window of exposure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Password Compromise:** Attackers who gain local access to a system running Trillian can easily obtain the user's Yahoo! Mail password.
    *   **Wider Account Compromise:**  Since users often reuse passwords, this vulnerability could lead to the compromise of other online accounts as well.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the computer where Trillian is installed.
    *   **Unsupervised Access:** An attacker needs a brief period of unsupervised access to the computer to retrieve the password from the temporary file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the target system.
    *   **Basic File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to browse the filesystem where Trillian's cache directory resides.

**Affected Software:**

*   Trillian Pro 3.1 Build 121
*   Trillian 3.0 Basic
*   Trillian 3.0 Pro

**Additional Notes:**

*   The user reported attempts to contact Cerulean Studios about the issue but received no response.
*   The vulnerability affects Windows XP Pro and Windows 2000 operating systems.
*   The temporary file is created within the `<Install Directory>\users\default\cache` directory and has a random name.
