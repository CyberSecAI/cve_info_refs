{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Yaws web server improperly handles null bytes within file paths.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The server fails to properly sanitize or validate the file name provided in the URL. Specifically, the presence of a null byte (%00) in the URL path before the file extension allows the server to expose the raw source code of .yaws scripts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can retrieve the source code of the web application's scripts, which may expose sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or other confidential data. This could lead to further compromise of the system or application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests. An attacker sends a specially crafted request to the web server with a null byte in the URL path before the .yaws extension, causing the server to serve the raw source instead of executing the script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special access or privileges on the server are required."
