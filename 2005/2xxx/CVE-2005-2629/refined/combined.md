RealPlayer Data Packet Stack Overflow

Release Date:
November 10, 2005

Date Reported:
May 28, 2005

Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)

Vendor:
RealNetworks

Systems Affected:
Windows:
RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1040-1235)
RealPlayer 10
RealOne Player v2
RealOne Player v1
RealPlayer 8
RealPlayer Enterprise

Mac:
RealPlayer 10

Linux:
RealPlayer 10 (10.0.0 - 5)
Helix Player (10.0.0 - 5)

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a critical vulnerability in
RealPlayer. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to reliably
overwrite stack memory with arbitrary data and execute arbitrary code in
the context of the user who executed the player.

This specific flaw exists in the first data packet contained in a Real
Media file. By specially crafting a malformed .rm movie file, a direct
stack overwrite is triggered, and reliable code execution is then
possible.

Technical Details:
The vulnerability is triggered by setting the application specific
length field of the [data packet + 1] to 0x80 - 0xFF this will cause a
stack overflow.
The value is sign-extended and passed as the length to memcpy.

Protection:
Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.
Blink End Point Protection proactively protects against this
vulnerability

Vendor Status:
RealNetworks has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available via the "Check for Update" menu item under Tools on the
RealPlayer menu bar or from
<http://service.real.com/realplayer/security/>.

Package        : helix-player
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-2629
BugTraq ID     : 15381

An integer overflow has been discovered in helix-player, the helix
audio and video player.  This flaw could allow a remote attacker to
run arbitrary code on a victims computer by supplying a specially
crafted network resource.

This vulnerability is fixed by version 1.0.6-1 in unstable.
Helix-player is not currently in the testing distribution.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a helix-player
package.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-1sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your helix-player package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

RealPlayer Data Packet Stack Overflow
Release Date:
November 10, 2005
Date Reported:
May 28, 2005
Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)
Vendor:
RealNetworks
Systems Affected:
Windows:
RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1040-1235)
RealPlayer 10
RealOne Player v2
RealOne Player v1
RealPlayer 8
RealPlayer Enterprise
Mac:

Linux:
RealPlayer 10 (10.0.0 - 5)

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a critical vulnerability in
RealPlayer. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to reliably
overwrite stack memory with arbitrary data and execute arbitrary code in
the context of the user who executed the player.
This specific flaw exists in the first data packet contained in a Real
Media file. By specially crafting a malformed .rm movie file, a direct
stack overwrite is triggered, and reliable code execution is then
possible.
Technical Details:
The vulnerability is triggered by setting the application specific
length field of the [data packet + 1] to 0x80 - 0xFF this will cause a
stack overflow.
The value is sign-extended and passed as the length to memcpy.
Protection:
Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.
Blink End Point Protection proactively protects against this
vulnerability
Vendor Status:
RealNetworks has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available via the "Check for Update" menu item under Tools on the
RealPlayer menu bar or from
http://service.real.com/realplayer/security/.
