Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Whisper32 password manager stores passwords in clear text within the process memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Cleartext Storage:** Passwords are not encrypted or obfuscated before being stored in memory.
-   **Lack of Memory Sanitization:** The process does not overwrite or nullify the password in memory after use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to stored passwords if they can obtain a memory dump of the running Whisper32 process.
-   **Compromised Credentials:** Exposed passwords can be used to access user accounts and resources associated with those credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Memory Dump:** An attacker must acquire a memory dump of the running Whisper32 process. This could be achieved through:
    -   Malware on the victim's machine.
    -   Direct access to the victim's machine.
    -   Exploiting a separate vulnerability to gain memory access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Access to Memory Dump:**  The attacker must be able to obtain a memory dump of the Whisper32 process while the program is loaded and a password file (.WSP) is loaded, but before the user has entered the password in the dialog box.
-   **Technical Skills:** The attacker must be capable of using special software to extract the password from the memory dump.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Whisper32 version 1.16 and possibly prior versions.
- The passwords are visible even if the user has not yet entered the password in the dialog box, as long as the .WSP file is loaded.
- The vendor has been notified, and no patch was available as of the date of the report (August 13th, 2005).
