## Microsoft BlnMgr Proxy (blnmgrps.dll) COM object fails to implement required methods

#### Vulnerability Note VU#898241

Original Release Date: 2005-10-14 | Last Revised: 2006-02-06

---

### Overview

The Microsoft BlnMgr Proxy COM object fails to implement the methods required by the IDispatch interface, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| **Microsoft COM**  [Microsoft COM](http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.mspx) is a technology that allows programmers to create reusable software components that can be incorporated into applications to extend their functionality. Microsoft COM includes COM+, Distributed COM (DCOM), and ActiveX Controls.**Internet Explorer**Internet Explorer will attempt to instantiate a COM object or ActiveX control that is referenced by an OBJECT tag in an HTML document.**BlnMgr Proxy COM object**The BlnMgr Proxy COM object is provided by blnmgrps.dll, which comes with various Microsoft products such as Microsoft Office.**The Problem**The BlnMgr Proxy COM object provides the [IDispatch](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/automat/htm/chap5_78v9.asp) interface, but it does not implement the required methods of [GetTypeInfoCount](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/automat/htm/chap5_3alw.asp), [GetTypeInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/automat/htm/chap5_8anj.asp), [GetIDsOfNames](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/automat/htm/chap5_32cz.asp), or [Invoke](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/automat/htm/chap5_61id.asp). When Internet Explorer attempts to instantiate the BlnMgr Proxy COM object, IE will crash because the methods required by the IDispatch interface are not present. The crash occurs in a way that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. The CLSID for this COM object is: {F27CE930-4CA3-11D1-AFF2-006097C9A284}. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause IE (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Apply the appropriate update, as specified in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-052](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-052.mspx). This update sets the "kill bit" for certain CLSID values of COM objects known to be vulnerable, including BlnMgr Proxy. |
| --- |

| **Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. With ActiveX controls disabled, COM objects will not be instantiated. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the document [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer) and the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56).Note that disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft DDS Library Shape Control (msdds.dll) COM object contains an unspecified vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#740372

Original Release Date: 2005-08-18 | Last Revised: 2005-10-13

---

### Overview

Microsoft DDS Library Shape Control COM object contains an unspecified vulnerability, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| **Microsoft COM**  [Microsoft COM](http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.mspx) is a technology that allows programmers to create reusable software components that can be incorporated into applications to extend their functionality. Microsoft COM includes COM+, Distributed COM (DCOM), and ActiveX Controls.**ActiveX controls**ActiveX controls are COM objects that are designed to be used in Internet Explorer. A web page can make use of an ActiveX control through the use of the OBJECT tag.**Microsoft DDS Library Shape Control**The Microsoft DDS Library Shape Control is a COM object provided by msdds.dll, which comes with various Microsoft products such as Visual Studio .NET and Microsoft Office.**The Problem**Internet Explorer will attempt to instantiate any COM object that is referenced by a web page. COM objects that are not ActiveX controls may cause unexpected results, such as crashing Internet Explorer. We are tracking this issue as [VU#680526](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/680526). The Microsoft DDS Library Shape Control COM object crashes in a way that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.Through limited local testing, it appears that systems with Visual Studio .NET 2002 are vulnerable to the public exploit code. msdds.dll versions 7.0.6064.9112 and 7.0.9466.0 are vulnerable, but version 7.10.3077.0 does not appear to be vulnerable. Although Office XP does provide a vulnerable version of msdds.dll, the default install does not provide the required msvcp70.dll and msvcr70.dll files for the COM object to be to be used by Internet Explorer. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause IE (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash.Proof of concept code is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Apply the appropriate update, as specified in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-052](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-052.mspx). This update sets the "kill bit" for certain CLSID values of COM objects known to be vulnerable, including the Microsoft DDS Library Shape Control. |
| --- |

| **Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. With ActiveX controls disabled, COM objects will not be instantiated. Instructions for disabling Active scripting and ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56). Note that disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. |

## Multiple COM objects cause memory corruption in Microsoft Internet Explorer

#### Vulnerability Note VU#959049

Original Release Date: 2005-08-09 | Last Revised: 2006-08-09

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) allows instantiation of COM objects not designed for use in the browser, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash IE.

### Description

| **Microsoft COM**  [Microsoft COM](http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.mspx) is a technology that allows programmers to create reusable software components that can be incorporated into applications to extend their functionality. Microsoft COM includes COM+, Distributed COM (DCOM), and ActiveX Controls.**ActiveX controls**ActiveX controls are COM objects that have visual elements. ActiveX controls are traditionally designed to be used in Internet Explorer. A web page can make use of an ActiveX control in various ways, such as by referencing its Class Identifier (CLSID) in an HTML OBJECT tag.**The Problem**Internet Explorer will attempt to instantiate any COM object that is referenced by a web page. Certain COM objects that are not designed for use in Internet Explorer may cause unexpected results, such as executing arbitrary code or crashing the browser.Exploit code for these vulnerabilities are publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, an HTML email message, or an email attachment), an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause IE (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply An Update**Apply the appropriate update, as specified in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-042](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-042.mspx). This update sets the "kill bit" for certain CLSID values of COM objects known to be vulnerable. The MS06-042 update is similar to [MS06-021](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-021.mspx), [MS06-013](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-013.mspx), [MS05-054](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-054.mspx), [MS05-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-037.mspx), [MS05-038](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-038.mspx), and [MS05-052](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-052.mspx), but it includes additional COM objects. |
| --- |

| Microsoft has listed several workarounds in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-054.mspx), including disabling ActiveX controls. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered public vulnerability and other privately-reported variations of the same vulnerability. The Microsoft DDS Library Shape Control (Msdds.dll) and other COM objects could, when instantiated in Internet Explorer, allow an attacker to take complete control of an affected system. Because these COM objects were not designed to be instantiated in Internet Explorer, this update sets the [kill bit](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797) for the affected Class Identifiers (CLSID) in these COM objects. The vulnerability is documented in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Internet Explorer 5.0 Service Pack 4 | Internet Explorer 5.5 Service Pack 2 on Windows ME | Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (All supported operating system versions earlier than Windows Server 2003) | Internet Explorer 6 for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 | Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP Service Pack 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-2127](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-2127) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Critical | Critical | Moderate | Critical |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The severity ratings for non-x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating systems versions as follows:

* The Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 for Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) severity rating is the same as the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (All supported operating system versions earlier than Windows Server 2003) severity rating.
* The Internet Explorer 6 for Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (All supported operating system versions earlier than Windows Server 2003) severity rating.
* The Internet Explorer 6 for Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems and Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Internet Explorer 6 for Windows Server 2003 severity rating.

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 896688](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/896688) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 896688](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/896688).

* [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 909889](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/909889): ActiveX controls may not load as expected in Internet Explorer due to defense in depth changes introduced in cumulative security update 896688 (MS05-052).
* [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 909738](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/909738): A Web page that contains a custom ActiveX control may not load as expected in Internet Explorer due to defense in depth changes introduced in cumulative security update 896688 (MS05-052)â.

**I have received a hotfix from Microsoft or my support provider since the release of MS04-004. Is that hotfix included in this security update?**

Yes. When you install the security update that is intended for systems that are running Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, or on Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. However, the installer only detects hotfixes that were released since Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851) and Internet Explorer [Update Rollup 873377](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/873377) or Internet Explorer [Update Rollup 889669](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/889669).
See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 896727](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/896727) for additional information if you have to apply a hotfix that was released before Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851) on a system that has the [MS05-052](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50690) update installed.

For Internet Explorer 6 for Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003, and Windows 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium), this security update contains hotfixes that were included with [MS04-025](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31981) or later Internet Explorer security updates, as well as fixes for all the security issues that are addressed in this update. However, the hotfix versions of the files that are included in this security update are only installed if you have previously installed an Internet Explorer hotfix to update any of the files that are listed in the âSecurity Update Informationâ section of this bulletin.

For Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2, and Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP, the [MS05-052](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50690) security updates contain hotfixes that were included after [MS04-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189) up to and including the cumulative updates in [MS05-052](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50690). The hotfix versions of the files that are included in this security update are installed regardless of whether you have previously installed an Internet Explorer hotfix to update any of the files that are listed in the âSecurity Update Informationâ section of this bulletin.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin and in addition to changes introduced in previous Internet Explorer security bulletins, this update introduces the following defense in depth improvements:

* This update introduces additional checks before a COM object is allowed to run in Internet Explorer. The intent of this change is to prevent COM objects that were not designed to be instantiated in Internet Explorer from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
* This update includes improvements to the Internet Explorer Pop-up Blocker. The Pop-up Blocker was first included in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and is also included in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. For more information about the Pop-up Blocker, see the [product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/web/sp2_popupblocker.mspx).
* This update includes improvements to the Internet Explorer Add-on Manager. Add-on Manager was first included in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and is also included in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. For more information about the Add-on Manager, see the [product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/web/sp2_addonmanager.mspx).
* This update includes a kill bit for the **ADODB.Stream** object. This kill bit was released previously, but not as part of a security update. For more information about the **ADODB.Stream** object, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 870669](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/870669). The Class Identifier (CLSID) for this object is 00000566-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4.
  **Note** If you are running an application in a corporate intranet environment, and the corporate intranet environment currently uses the **ADODB.Stream** object with Internet Explorer, applying this update may cause the application to break. To restore application functionality, we recommend that you first set your Internet Explorer browser security level to High, and then you must clear the compatibility flag of the **ADODB.Stream** object. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 870669](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/870669) for more information about how to affect this change.

**Does this update contain any other changes to functionality?**

Yes. This update also includes non-security-related changes that were introduced in previous Internet Explorer security bulletins.

**How does the extended support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition affect the release of security updates for these operating systems?**

Microsoft will only release security updates for critical security issues. Non-critical security issues are not offered during this support period. For more information about the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policies for these operating systems, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33327).

**Security update support for Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

With the release of Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) will no longer receive security update support. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. Microsoft will continue to fully support Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based systems, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions for 64-bit computing requirements. Microsoft continues to license and support Windows Server 2003 Enterprise and Datacenter editions for Itanium-based systems, and the 64-bit version of SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition. In the future, we will expand Itanium support to Visual Studio 2005, .NET Framework 2005, and SQL Server 2005.

## Vulnerability Details

#### COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2127:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer instantiates COM objects that are not intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited the malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2127:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98, and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2127:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls or to disable ActiveX controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
3. Click **Custom Level**.
4. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
6. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

**Note** Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

**Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones**

You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

**Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for the Local intranet security zone by clicking the **Local intranet** icon.

**Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

**Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.

* **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites**

After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.

* **Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer**

You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

**Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

For detailed steps about preventing a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

For example, to set the kill bit for a CLSID in the Msdds.dll, file that is included in this security update, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{EC444CB6-3E7E-4865-B1C3-0DE72EF39B3F}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

[Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)

[What is Group Policy Object Editor?](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a3)

[Core Group Policy tools and settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc9491)

**Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

**Impact of Workaround**: There is no impact as long as the COM object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.

#### FAQ for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2127:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer tries to instantiate certain COM objects as ActiveX controls, the COM objects may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would host a Web site that exploits this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. It could also be possible to display malicious Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a malicious Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages or that a user visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

Yes. Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition are critically affected by this vulnerability. The security updates are available from the [Windows Update Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130). For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**What does the update do?**

Because not all COM objects are designed to be accessed through Internet Explorer, this update sets the [kill bit](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797) for a list of Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) in COM objects that have been found to exhibit similar behavior to the COM object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability that is addressed in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=45781). To help protect customers, this update prevents these CLSIDs from being instantiated in Internet Explorer. For more information about kill bits, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797).

The Class Identifiers and corresponding COM objects are as follows.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

Arpidfix.exe is used by the security update installer to address an issue documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 904630](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/904630). This file is not installed onto the affected system.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP2\KB896688\Filelist

**Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 896688 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows XP Service Pack 2 (all versions) and Windows XP Professional x64

This security update requires Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 322389](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389).

**Note** For Windows XP Professional x64, this security update is the same as the Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition security update.

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**

The update for this issue will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Microsoft Windows XP:

**Windowsxp-kb896688-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB896688.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows XP:

**Windowsxp-kb896688-x86-enu /norestart**

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Internet Explorer 5.01\SP4\KB896688-IE501SP4-20050909.233456\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 896688 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
