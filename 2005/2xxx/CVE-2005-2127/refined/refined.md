    "cve": "CVE-2005-2127",
    "description": "The Microsoft BlnMgr Proxy COM object fails to implement the methods required by the IDispatch interface, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Additionally, the Microsoft DDS Library Shape Control COM object contains an unspecified vulnerability, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Multiple COM objects cause memory corruption in Microsoft Internet Explorer.",
