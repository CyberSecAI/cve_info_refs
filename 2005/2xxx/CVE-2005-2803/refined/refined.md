Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-2803 (though the provided text also mentions CAN-2005-2336, which is likely the older identifier for the same vulnerability).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from inadequate handling of user-supplied input, specifically page names, within the Hiki wiki software. This includes:

*   **Missing Escaping:** Hiki versions 0.8.0 to 0.8.2 fail to properly escape page names when accessing missing pages, and Hiki versions 0.8.1 - 0.8.2 also fail to escape page names in login links.
*   **Configuration File Loss:** Hiki versions 0.8.0 to 0.8.2 are also vulnerable to losing configuration files due to unexpected queries during the saving of configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper escaping allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, like JavaScript, into a page via crafted page names.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** The configuration file loss and XSS can be exploited to change configurations, including passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can inject malicious script to steal session IDs of logged-in users.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** With stolen session IDs, attackers can impersonate users.
*   **Administrative Control:** If an administrator's session ID is stolen, the attacker can change settings, potentially gaining full control of the wiki.
*   **Data Loss/Modification:** By manipulating configurations or performing actions on behalf of the compromised user/admin, the attacker could alter or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URLs:** Attackers craft URLs containing malicious script in the page name and trick users into accessing these URLs. This can be done by sending the URL directly or including the links on another website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker needs the ability to generate crafted URLs with malicious scripts.
*   **Social Engineering:** To get users to click on the malicious URLs, social engineering may be used.
*  **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Hiki versions 0.8.0 through 0.8.2.
*   Hiki version 0.8.3 addresses the vulnerability.
*   The JVN entry (JVN#38138980) refers to this issue.
*   The vulnerability is a combination of missing input escaping and a bug that leads to configuration file loss.
