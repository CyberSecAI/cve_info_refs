Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2069:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to enforce TLS (Transport Layer Security) on referred connections in `pam_ldap` and `nss_ldap`. When an LDAP client (like `pam_ldap` or `nss_ldap`) connects to a secondary/slave LDAP server using TLS and is then referred to a master LDAP server, the subsequent connection to the master server does not use TLS, even if the `ldap.conf` is configured to use `ssl start_tls`. This occurs because the client libraries did not properly re-initiate TLS for referrals.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Transmission of Credentials:** The primary weakness is the transmission of sensitive information, such as passwords, in plaintext over the network when a referral occurs.
- **Incorrect TLS Handling:** The client software fails to maintain TLS encryption during referrals. Specifically, the `ldap_start_tls_s()` function didn't properly check if TLS was already in place on the *default* connection when a referral happens and would incorrectly assume it was.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Disclosure:** An attacker positioned on the network can intercept and capture usernames and passwords transmitted in plaintext.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Captured credentials can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or services that rely on the vulnerable LDAP authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** Attackers need to be on the network path between the client system and the LDAP servers to eavesdrop on unencrypted communication.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** While not explicitly stated, an MitM attack could be used in conjunction with a vulnerable server setup

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the network traffic between the client system and the LDAP servers. This could be an internal network or an untrusted network.
- **Passive Sniffing:** The attacker does not need to actively interfere with the communication, they can passively capture traffic.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both `pam_ldap` and `nss_ldap` as they share code.
- The issue arises when using LDAP master-slave setups with referrals during password changes or other operations that involve referrals.
- The problem is present when the LDAP client connects to a slave server over TLS, and the slave server then refers the client to a master server.
-  The issue can exist even when the `ldap.conf` file is set to `ssl start_tls` because the setting is not enforced on referrals.
- The bug is also present in the `openldap` library itself, and a patch is required there, as well as in the client packages.

In summary, CVE-2005-2069 exposes a critical vulnerability where sensitive LDAP authentication data is transmitted in plaintext due to improper TLS handling during referrals, allowing attackers to potentially capture credentials.
