  "CVE-2005-2270": {
    "description": "The Mozilla browser family does not properly clone base objects, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "Improper cloning of base objects allowed web content scripts to walk up the prototype chain to get to a privileged object.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Insecure cloning of base objects",
          "Insufficient access control"
        ],
        "impact": "Remote attackers could execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "By loading a malicious webpage in the vulnerable browser."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, an attacker needs to be able to have the victim load a webpage under their control.",
         "additional_notes": "The vulnerability stems from how Mozilla handles prototype chains in JavaScript. By exploiting this flaw, attackers can gain access to privileged objects and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is triggered when functions from XPConnect components are called, because the Javascript engine fails to properly sanitize the call chain and grants too much privilege."
