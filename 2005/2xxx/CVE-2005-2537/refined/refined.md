```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - Path Disclosure: Supplying null bytes or reserved device names to the 'mod' parameter in index.php reveals the full server path.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):  Various parameters in structure.php and footer.php are vulnerable to XSS by injecting malicious javascript code through GET parameters.
    - Remote Code Execution: By injecting carriage return (ASCII char 13) characters into the user signature field during registration, an attacker can inject arbitrary php code into the generated user file which can be executed via a crafted HTTP request.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Path disclosure
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
    - Remote code execution
    - Lack of input sanitization/validation
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Path disclosure reveals the server's file system structure.
    - XSS allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    - Remote code execution allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
- Attack vectors:
    - Path Disclosure: crafted HTTP GET requests to index.php.
    - XSS: crafted HTTP GET requests to structure.php and footer.php.
    - Remote Code Execution: crafted HTTP POST request to register a user, injecting malicious code, followed by a crafted HTTP GET request to the user's profile file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Path Disclosure: None.
    - XSS: None.
    - Remote Code Execution: Able to access the FlatNuke application and register a user.
