- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - SQL Injection: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `usernick`, `letters`, and `im_receiver` parameters within `include.php`, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
    - PHP Code Injection: Unrestricted file upload in `admin/admin.php` when `path=images.php`, allowing the upload of PHP files to the `content/images/` directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - SQL Injection in `include.php` via `usernick` and `letters` parameters when `path=login/member.php`
    - SQL Injection in `include.php` via `im_receiver` parameter when `path=login/imcenter.php`
    - PHP code injection via unrestricted file upload in `admin/admin.php?path=images.php`
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - SQL Injection: The attacker can manipulate SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., password hashes) or modifying database content.
    - PHP Code Injection: The attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - SQL Injection: Sending crafted HTTP GET requests to `include.php` with malicious values in the vulnerable parameters.
    - PHP Code Injection: Logging in as a legitimate administrator and uploading a malicious PHP file through the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - SQL Injection: No special access is required, the attacker just need to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
    - PHP Code Injection: Attacker needs valid admin credentials.
