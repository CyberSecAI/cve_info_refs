- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses a variable `$config['root_dir']` which is controllable by user input via a POST request, and uses it in a `require_once()` call, allowing for remote file inclusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote file inclusion vulnerability due to insecure use of `require_once()` with user-controlled input. The code in several files directly includes user-supplied paths without sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution by including a remote malicious PHP script. Attackers can potentially gain control of the web server.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP POST request to vulnerable PHP files, setting the `config[root_dir]` parameter with a URL pointing to a malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker also requires a web server to host a malicious PHP script to be included. The `register_globals` PHP setting must be enabled on the server.
