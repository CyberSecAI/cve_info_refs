```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A heap buffer overflow occurs in the XBM image processing due to an improperly terminated XBM image ending with space characters instead of the expected end tag.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap buffer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- Attack vectors: By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted XBM image.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to entice the user to open a malicious XBM image.
