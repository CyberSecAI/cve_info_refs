Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Directory Traversal**

*   **Root Cause:** The i-Gallery application lacks proper input validation and sanitization when handling user-supplied folder paths, specifically within the "folderview.asp" file.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application does not prevent the use of directory traversal sequences like "/../" in the `folder` parameter of `folderview.asp`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers can access and download arbitrary files from the server's file system, provided they know the file path.
    *   Sensitive files, such as the Windows SAM file (containing user password hashes), can potentially be retrieved.
    *   The application also allows for listing files within directories using the preview feature.
*   **Attack Vector:**  HTTP GET request to the `folderview.asp` file, with a modified `folder` parameter containing directory traversal sequences.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to know the path of the file they wish to access.
    *   Basic understanding of directory traversal techniques is required to craft the malicious URL.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*  **Root Cause:** i-Gallery does not validate user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the application.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation for user requests allows injection of arbitrary script into the application through the folder parameter.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
    *   Possible session hijacking by stealing the cookies of authenticated users on the secured interface of i-Gallery.
*   **Attack Vector:**  HTTP GET request to the `folderview.asp` file, with a modified `folder` parameter containing Javascript code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Basic understanding of Cross-Site Scripting and how it can be leveraged to inject malicious JavaScript code.
    *   No authentication is required to inject the malicious script.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that older versions of i-Gallery are assumed to be vulnerable.
*   The vendor was informed of the vulnerabilities but did not respond by the time of advisory release.
*   The advisory indicates that the directory traversal is unique compared to classic attacks in that the file name is already known by i-gallery and only the path needs to be crafted.
