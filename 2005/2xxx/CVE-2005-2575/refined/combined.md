Vendor notified at and partial patch:
<http://forums.xmbforum.com/viewthread.php?tid=754523>

firstly the input validation at xmb.php:

foreach ($global as $num => $array) {
if (is_array($array)) {
extract($array, EXTR_OVERWRITE);
}
}

this should put to not overwrite any variables cause
it overwrite server set variables too. this creates problems
when user submits a additional field in form:

<input type="text" name="_SERVER[REMOTE_ADDR]" value="555.555.555.555">

secondly there is a case of sql injection in include/u2u.inc.php
line ~491:
Code:

$in = '';
foreach ( $u2u_select as $value ) {
if ( $GLOBALS['type'.$value] != 'outgoing' ) {
$in .= ( empty( $in ) ) ? "$value" : ",$value";
}
}
...
$db->query( "UPDATE $table_u2u SET readstatus='no' WHERE u2uid IN($in) AND owner='$self[username]'" );

the variable $in is not actually validated and could and will cause problems if not fixed.

## A Message From The Lead Developer

Greetings XMB Webmasters and potential XMB users,

xmbforum2.com is dedicated to the open-source forum software that I maintained since May 2008.
Many members of the XMB community have been involved in this project years longer than that, and they deserve most of the credit for the existence of the software.
This website will help to ensure that the XMB forum and community have a reliable website to call home.

The great thing about XMB is that it is free. All of the software on this website is licensed by its authors under
the open source license called GPL. That means everyone is allowed to use the software, and distribute the software,
and modify the software.

More information about the terms of use can be found at the [GNU Project Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/) page.

Sincerely,

Robert Chapin
