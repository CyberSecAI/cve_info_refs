{
  "CVE-2005-2490": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A buffer overflow in the sendmsg() function allows local users to execute arbitrary code.",
    "details": "The `sendmsg()` function in the Linux kernel does not sufficiently validate its input data. Specifically, when copying 32-bit `msg_control` contents to the kernel, the same userland data is walked twice without proper sanity checks on the second pass. Furthermore, if the original data looks small enough, the copy may end up on a stack-allocated array, leading to a stack buffer overflow. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling `sendmsg()` and modifying the passed message from another thread, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code with kernel privileges. This vulnerability primarily affects amd64 systems.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Linux Kernel",
       "sendmsg() function"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation and lack of bounds checking when copying user-provided data to kernel memory.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
        "Inadequate input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges, privilege escalation",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation",
        "sendmsg() function call"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access, ability to invoke the `sendmsg()` system call, and a separate thread for data modification.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability primarily affects amd64 systems, but similar vulnerabilities were present in other architectures. Patches were made available for RHEL4, and RHEL3 (with an incremental patch),  and also Ubuntu 4.10 & 5.04.",
