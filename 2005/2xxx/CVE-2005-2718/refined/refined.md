{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2005-2718",
    "Root cause": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of raw PCM audio streams within MPlayer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow in `ad_pcm.c` when handling audio headers with large channel count or sample size, specifically in the WAVEHEADEREX struct of raw PCM audio streams."
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution by overwriting the instruction pointer.",
    "Attack vectors": "Playing a specially crafted video or audio file with a malicious audio header.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious media file that triggers the overflow. The user needs to play the file using a vulnerable version of MPlayer."
  },
  "add_info": {
    "More Details": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a WAVEHEADEREX struct in raw PCM audio streams. High values in `nChannels` and `wBitsPerSample` fields of the struct lead to a buffer overflow in `sh_audio->a_buffer`.",
    "Affected versions": "MPlayer versions 1.0_pre7 and earlier are vulnerable.",
    "Affected OS": "Linux 2.4 and 2.6 and potentially other OS",
        "Workaround": "A workaround without recompiling is to add `ac=-pcm,` to the config file.",
    "Notes": "The exploit can overwrite function pointers in libSDL and that an exploit may need modifications to be generalized across platforms due to differences in memory layout."
