| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-23 22:20:02 UTC  ``` Not sure this one is valid. Auditors please confirm:    Advisory: mplayer buffer overflow    Product:          mplayer  Affected Version: 1.0_pre7 (tested), 1.0_pre6-r4 (tested),  1.0pre6-3.3.5-20050130 (confirmed)  OS affected:      Linux 2.4.* (tested), 2.6.* (confirmed), other OS not  tested  Date:             24.08.2005  Author:           Sven Tantau - <http://www.sven-tantau.de/>  Advisory-URL:  <http://www.sven-tantau.de/public_files/mplayer/mplayer_20050824.txt>  Vendor-URL:       <http://www.mplayerhq.hu/>  Vendor-Status:    informed      Product  =======    >> man mplayer    DESCRIPTION  mplayer  is  a movie player for Linux (runs on many other platforms and  CPU architectures, see the documentation).  It plays most  MPEG/VOB, AVI, ASF/WMA/WMV, RM, QT/MOV/MP4, OGG/OGM, MKV, VIVO, FLI,  NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM and RoQ files, supported by many  native and binary codecs.  You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX  3/4/5 and even WMV movies, too.    ...    Details  =======    For high values of the 2 bytes strf parameter in the audio header of a  video file, it is possible to overflow sh_audio->a_buffer, overwrite the  instruction pointer and execute arbitrary code.    Not sure, but I think the problem is in:    af.c: int af_calc_insize_constrained(af_stream_t* s, int len,int  max_outsize,int max_insize);    ...as this function is used to calculate declen in dec_audio.c, and  declen is supposed to prevent an overflow.    Instruction pointer gets overwritten in:  libmpdemux/demuxer.c: int demux_read_data(demux_stream_t *ds,unsigned  char* mem,int len);    If would like to reproduce this or write an exploit:  Get a copy of 'Animaniacs - Nations of the World.avi'.

My Gentoo system is 64bit, so it won't work there either...  Reimar, it was only a quick example to reproduce the crash as the instructions  provided in the original advisory were not very helpful. It would take much more  work to make a general purpose, work everywhere exploit and my motivation was  simply to satisfy myself that this issue could be exploited. If you want to  confirm it can be exploited, you will have to modify it to work on your system:  run mplayer on the exploit.avi in gdb, and break on the decode_video function:  $ gdb -q (gdb) file mplayer Reading symbols from /usr/bin/mplayer...done.

It is not a strf parameter, it is a strf chunk. And in this case the one for the audio that contains the WAVEHEADEREX struct. High values in nChannels and wBitsPerSample in that struct can be used to exploit it. Also it should be possible to exploit with any container, i.e. wav, mov, etc. Anything that can contain raw PCM and allows to set either sample size or channel count to arbitrary numbers. Correct me if you think I'm wrong. ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-09-08 07:55:46 UTC  ``` You must be correct, as I'm getting lost in chunks, structs and headers... Would the following change in our GLSA describe the issue more correctly :  "Sven Tantau discovered a heap overflow in the code handling the WAVEHEADEREX struct of raw PCM audio streams."  Do you see any other needed change (like in the Title or Synopsis) ? ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  Reimar Döffinger    2005-09-09 11:04:31 UTC  ``` I'd suggest "Sven Tantau discovered a heap overflow in the code handling raw PCM audio  streams with large channel count or sample size." Mentioning WAVEHEADEREX is confusing IMHO, since it does not really matter how  the number of channels/samplesize was specified. ``` |  |

Hi, thanks for stopping by!

My name is Sven Tantau and I am German by birth, Norwegian by my mom and part-time African by choice.

I started playing with technology at an early age, and gladly my parents always supported this hobby of mine. I really appreciate how many doors it opened for me since then.

If I am not busy on my keyboard, I like to hang out with my friends, [travel](more.html#travel) and spend quality time with my ~~girlfriend~~ wife.

I am very proud and happy to be a co-founder of [nebenan.de](https://nebenan.de/), where I had 5 years the privilege to work with an awesome team to bring neighbors a bit closer together.
Currently I am working as co-founder of the gut.org invest GmbH with an equally awesome team to make impact investing easier. [bcause.com](https://bcause.com/)

Below is more information on the ~~services I offer~~ (currently not available!) and the projects I have been doing.

If you have any questions or just want to talk about tech-stuff,
please do not hesitate to [contact me](#contact).

Cheers!

###### what I do

### Software Development

I had my first job as a programmer in 1998 building perl based websites. Since then I have worked on many applications, ranging from simple content management systems over community software to ERP systems and business process automation.
I also enjoy to work on mobile phones or writing software for your startup.

### Systems Integration and Telecommunications

Working for and with multiple internet service providers I had the opportunity to build and migrate WiMAX networks, write and deploy various services and play with expensive hardware. With a preference for open source software I help companies to customize available solutions to their needs and make existing components work together.

### Security Consulting

I also offer security consulting with focus on web applications and general information security. I have discovered security problems in web applications, kernel modules, as well as in consumer software like ebook readers or video players. I also reverse engineered firmware to break authentication methods and hunted for backdoors.

On the defending side I've build and integrated firewalls, IDS or NACs like packetfence.

###### Some Keywords

#### Programming Languages:

At the moment I get most work done with ruby, perl, javascript or c.

But I've also worked with java, objective c, x86 asm or scripting languages like php, python, basic dialects or query languages.

Yes, I do automated testing; I use version control and I love CI.

#### Operating systems:

Linux preferred. Accidental knowledge about Windows, BSD and Mac. I also picked up some cisco skills along the way.

#### Software I've setup, used and maintained:

Postgresql, MySQL/MariaDB, IBM-DB2

Apache, Lighttpd, nginx, HaProxy

Postfix, Exim, Courier

Freeradius, Radiator, Samba, Squid, cvs, svn, git, dhcpd, nfs, pppoe, asterisk, openfire, rrdtool, zabbix, snort, packetfence...

Many proprietary NMS systems like snmpc, other monitoring solutions, firewalls, more or less everything you would find inside an ancient or modern ISP.

#### Hardware:

Experience with smart card programming.

Radio systems from multiple vendors like Alvarion/Telrad, Airspan, Ceragon. WiMAX, Microwave, VSAT installations.
And some mobile devices.
