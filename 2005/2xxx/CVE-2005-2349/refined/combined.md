Either the fix for [CVE-2005-2349](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2349) (bug #309594) wasn't complete, or it
bit-rotted, because Zoo is still susceptible to directory traversal:

$ pwd
/home/jwilk

$ zoo x traversal.zoo
Zoo:  /tmp/moo       -- extracted

$ ls -l /tmp/moo
-rw-r--r-- 1 jwilk users 4 Jan  5  2015 /tmp/moo

The script I used to create the test case is available at:

To clarify, #309594 discussed only relative path traversal (via ".."
sequences), but AFAICS the patch[0] tries to address also absolute path
traversal.

And, despite the patch, Zoo is currently susceptible to relative
directory traversal, too:

$ zoo x traversal-relative.zoo
Zoo:  ../moo         -- skipped

$ ls -l ../moo
-rw-r--r-- 1 jwilk users 4 Jan  5  2015 ../moo

```
Control: severity -1 serious

Rationale: The package is currently without maintainer (QA
maintained) and has this open for several years. Thus either for
buster the issue is fixed or not included.

Alternatively, but has still high popcon, remove zoo from the archive?

Regards,
Salvatore

```
Package: zoo
Version: 2.10-12
Severity: important
Tags: security

zoo suffers from a directory traversal bug. When unpacking
.zoo archives, there's no check for "../.." constructs in the file names,
which makes it possible to unpack to arbitrary locations in the file system.

unzoo was affected, too. Please see
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=306164> for more
information.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c0)  Ludwig Nussel   2004-10-14 20:09:40 UTC  ``` "doubles" again posted something about a directory traversal bug, this time in "unzoo". I checked our zoo program which is not unzoo but it is vulnerable as well. The issue is therefore semi-public.  Just like with unarj it looks like one can only create new files but not overwrite existing ones. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c1)  Ludwig Nussel   2004-10-14 20:10:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 24998](attachment.cgi?id=24998 "archive that creates /etc/foo when extraced with zoo x") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=24998&action=edit "archive that creates /etc/foo when extraced with zoo x") archive that creates /etc/foo when extraced with zoo x ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c2)  Marian Jancar   2004-10-21 18:30:26 UTC  ``` the intention is to create directories only under the current working direcory, right? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c3)  Ludwig Nussel   2004-10-21 19:02:04 UTC  ``` Yes. I think it is sufficient to fix it in STABLE. amavisd seems to extract  each file to stdout individually and is therefore not affected.  ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c4)  Marian Jancar   2004-12-02 19:56:37 UTC  ``` will fix for 9.3 ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c5)  Ludwig Nussel   2005-08-11 09:04:45 UTC  ``` did you fix it?  ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c6)  Anna Maresova   2005-08-11 18:47:07 UTC  ``` fixes submitted ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c7)  Ludwig Nussel   2005-08-12 11:40:42 UTC  ``` Where does the patch come from, did you write it yourself? If so did you  coordinate with upstream?    Is the string you sanitize a directory or a file name? If it's a dir name it  would probably still allow one level dir traversals if the path ends in ".."  instead of "../".  ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c8)  Anna Maresova   2005-08-12 13:00:13 UTC  ``` The patch is taken from Debian. It sanitizes a dirname. Could you please create an exploit with the few "../" and ".." on the end? The archive with the /etc/foo can be modified to contain the ".." on the end siply by swapping the "etc" and "..", but while not perfectly handled this is not an exploint, it can't leave the current directory. Striping the "etc" completely probably requires changing the CRC and I don't know how to do that.  ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c9)  Ludwig Nussel   2005-08-15 12:10:14 UTC  ``` I have no idea how to create crafted zoo archives. Too uncritical to waste  much time. We'll just accept the patch then.  ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c10)  Marian Jancar   2005-08-15 14:11:06 UTC  ``` ok, fix submited with the check for ".." ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c11)  Michael SchrÃ¶der   2005-08-22 10:14:06 UTC  ``` Secteam, how about writing some patchinfos?  ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c12)  Ludwig Nussel   2005-08-22 10:58:27 UTC  ``` this was supposed to go into STABLE only.  ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c13)  Marian Jancar   2005-08-22 12:32:06 UTC  ``` sorry for the confusion, fixed ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=62234#c14)  Ruediger Oertel   2005-09-16 11:53:00 UTC  ``` removed submissions for !STABLE   ``` |  |

Subject: Possible "new" CVE for Zoo directory traversal

<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774453>

Package: zoo
Version: 2.10-27+b1
Tags: security

Either the fix for CVE-2005-2349 (bug #309594) wasn't complete, or it
bit-rotted, because Zoo is still susceptible to directory traversal:

$ pwd
/home/jwilk

$ zoo x traversal.zoo
Zoo:  /tmp/moo       -- extracted

$ ls -l /tmp/moo
-rw-r--r-- 1 jwilk users 4 Jan  5  2015 /tmp/moo

The script I used to create the test case is available at:
<https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/path-traversal-samples>

-- System Information:
Debian Release: 8.0
 APT prefers unstable
 APT policy: (990, 'unstable'), (500, 'experimental')
Architecture: i386 (x86_64)
Foreign Architectures: amd64

Kernel: Linux 3.2.0-4-amd64 (SMP w/2 CPU cores)
Locale: LANG=C, LC_CTYPE=pl_PL.UTF-8 (charmap=UTF-8)
Shell: /bin/sh linked to /bin/dash
Init: sysvinit (via /sbin/init)

Versions of packages zoo depends on:
ii  libc6  2.19-13
