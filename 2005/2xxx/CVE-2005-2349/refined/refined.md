        "data": "Root cause of vulnerability: The zoo archive utility is vulnerable to directory traversal due to insufficient checks on filenames within the archive.\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The software does not properly sanitize or validate file paths included in a zoo archive. This allows filenames containing \"..\" sequences or absolute paths to be used to extract files outside the intended target directory.\nImpact of exploitation: Arbitrary file creation on the filesystem at locations specified within the malicious archive. This could potentially overwrite existing files, install malicious code, or otherwise compromise the system.\nAttack vectors: A malicious zoo archive crafted to include relative path traversal sequences or absolute paths within filenames.\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable system with a specially crafted zoo archive and execute the zoo utility to extract the archive. The user of the zoo program has to explicitly run the command to extract the malicious archive, therefore, this requires some form of social engineering."
