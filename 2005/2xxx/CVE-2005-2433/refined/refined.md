Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `id` parameter within the `public_html/lists/admin/?page=admin` script.
*   **Weaknesses:** The `id` parameter is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data from the database. They might also be able to gain control of the system.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable page, including malicious SQL in the `id` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Path disclosure vulnerabilities are present in various PHP scripts due to the lack of checks to determine if the script is directly accessed.
*   **Weaknesses:** The scripts are designed to be included by other scripts. They are not designed to be directly accessed by users. If a script is called directly, it discloses the absolute path of the script and other possible information.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could use the information about the server's directory structure to plan further attacks or discover sensitive files.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker directly accesses the vulnerable PHP scripts through the web server.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.

The following files are listed as vulnerable:

*   `public_html/lists/admin/about.php`
