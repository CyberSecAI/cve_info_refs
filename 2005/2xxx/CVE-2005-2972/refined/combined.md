# AbiWord: New RTF import buffer overflows — GLSA **200510-17**

AbiWord is vulnerable to an additional set of buffer overflows during RTF
import, making it vulnerable to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/abiword** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.11** |

### Background

AbiWord is a free and cross-platform word processing program. It
allows to import RTF files into AbiWord documents.

### Description

Chris Evans discovered a different set of buffer overflows than
the one described in GLSA 200509-20 in the RTF import function in
AbiWord.

### Impact

An attacker could design a malicious RTF file and entice a user to
import it in AbiWord, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running AbiWord.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All AbiWord users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/abiword-2.2.11"
```

Hi!
```
```

More RTF import buffer overflows have been found:

<http://www.abisource.com/viewcvs/cgi/viewcvs.cgi/abi/src/wp/impexp/xp/ie_imp_RTF.cpp.diff?r1=1.347.2.19&r2=1.347.2.21>

(yes, two patches, the first one had a typo).

This has been assigned CAN-2005-2972. You can get the Ubuntu debdiff from

  <http://patches.ubuntu.com/patches/abiword.CAN-2005-2972.diff>

Thanks,

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 894-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
November 14th, 2005                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : abiword
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-2964 CVE-2005-2972

Chris Evans discoverd several buffer overflows in the RTF import
mechanism of AbiWord, a WYSIWYG word processor based on GTK 2.
Opening a specially crafted RTF file could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2+cvs.2002.06.05-1woody3.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.7-3sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your abiword package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
