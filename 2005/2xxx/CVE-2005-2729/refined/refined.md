Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities found in Astaro Security Linux 6.0, specifically related to CVE-2005-2729:

**Vulnerability 1: HTTP CONNECT Access Localhost Weakness**

*   **Root Cause:** The Astaro Security Linux 6.0 proxy server running on port 8080/TCP incorrectly allows HTTP CONNECT requests directed towards localhost.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The proxy doesn't properly restrict CONNECT requests, allowing an attacker to use the proxy to connect to services running on localhost (e.g., HTTPd on port 80, SSH admin port) through the proxy. This bypasses intended network restrictions.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass the firewall and access internal services on the Astaro server, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or further compromise of the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can send crafted HTTP CONNECT requests to the proxy server (port 8080) to access localhost services.
*  **Required Capabilities/Position:** An attacker only needs network access to port 8080 of the Astaro system, no authentication is required.

**Additional Issues (Not directly CVE-2005-2729 but relevant):**

*   **Issue 2: Proxy Authentication Leakage**
    *   **Root Cause:** Sending an invalid, unauthenticated request to the proxy server exposes the string "Proxy-authorization: Basic LTpwcHBwCg==" in the response. This string corresponds to internal login credentials used by the Content Filter Framework, and is hardcoded in the binary `/var/storage/chroot-http/usr/bin/hyperdyper`.
    *   **Weakness:** The server reveals internal credentials in the response to an invalid request.
    *   **Impact:** This can potentially lead to internal framework access if these credentials can be exploited.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending an unauthenticated "CONNECT" request to the proxy.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Network access to the proxy server.
*   **Issue 3: Webmin Directory Traversal**
    *   **Root Cause:** A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the Webmin interface.
    *   **Weakness:** Authenticated Webmin users can access files on the filesystem outside of the intended webmin-gui access via crafted URLs.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to system files, leading to information disclosure.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting specific GET requests to the webmin interface.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires a valid webmin user account.
*   **Issue 4: Webmin Admin Disconnect with Script Injection**
    *   **Root Cause:**  When a new admin logs into Webmin, they can disconnect existing logged-in admins with a custom message. Script code can be injected into the disconnect message.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of input sanitization allows for injection of script code.
    *   **Impact:**  The script code executes in the browser of the disconnected admin, potentially allowing for XSS attacks or other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Logging into the Webmin interface as an admin while another admin is active and sending a crafted disconnect message.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** A valid webmin user account.

**Solution:**

*   Upgrade to Astaro Security Linux version 6.0.0.2 or later.

**Vendor Response:**

*   Astaro responded quickly and released fixes within a day after being notified of the vulnerabilities.

The primary vulnerability related to CVE-2005-2729 is the HTTP CONNECT access weakness, which is described in detail in the analysis above. The other issues are additional findings that are security-relevant but not directly related to the CVE.
