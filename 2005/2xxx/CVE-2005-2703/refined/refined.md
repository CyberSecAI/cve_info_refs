  "CVE-2005-2703": {
    "description": "Remote attackers could spoof HTTP headers of XML HTTP requests via XMLHttpRequest and possibly use the client to exploit vulnerabilities in servers or proxies.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Mozilla handles HTTP headers when using XMLHttpRequest. It allows malformed headers to be added to a request.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "HTTP header spoofing",
        "Improper handling of HTTP headers",
        "Insufficient validation of header values in XMLHttpRequest"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks, bypass same-origin policy restrictions when used with proxies, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive intranet data, or exploit flaws in servers or proxies from the user's machine. It could allow the attacker to make a single request appear as multiple requests to the server/proxy.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network requests",
        "XMLHttpRequests"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious XMLHttpRequest with crafted headers. This could be done by hosting malicious code on a webpage or by sending a malicious email, or in any other way that can cause the vulnerable application to make the request."
