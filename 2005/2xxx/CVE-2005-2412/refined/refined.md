- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `block.php` script in PHP FirstPost directly includes the value of the `$Include` variable without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application does not validate the input provided for the `$Include` variable allowing it to include arbitrary remote files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the target server by including a malicious PHP script located on an attacker-controlled server. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL that points to a remote PHP script using the `Include` parameter in `block.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. The attacker also needs to host a malicious PHP script on a publicly accessible server.
