The provided content describes two stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in GoodTech's SMTP server.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unchecked string copies within the RCPT TO command handling.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Stack overflow in RCPT TO command handling:**
   - The server copies the requested email address (from the RCPT TO command) into a 2048-byte buffer without checking its length.
   - The domain is extracted and copied to a 256-byte buffer without checking its length.
   - A `sprintf` function is used to construct a string "mx.%s", where the `%s` is the extracted domain. This output is placed in a 64-byte buffer, which can overflow due to the long domain.
   - A subsequent `sprintf` uses a DNS server string which was overwritten in the previous step, copying into a 1024 byte buffer, and potentially overwriting the return address of the function.
2. **Stack overflow in multiple RCPT TO commands handling:**
   - For each RCPT TO command, a 1300-byte structure is filled. The command string (up to 4096 bytes) is copied into this structure without any length checks.
   - By issuing a long command in the 99th RCPT TO command, the return address of the thread can be overwritten.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM user privileges. The attacker can execute code on the server.
- Service crashes, as demonstrated by the provided proof of concept.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted RCPT TO commands to the vulnerable SMTP server.
- The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely via network connection on port 25.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SMTP server.
- They must be able to send SMTP commands to the server on port 25.
