- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Fusebox framework does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `fuseaction` parameter in URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
    - Cookie stealing by redirecting users to a malicious script.
    - Full path disclosure (if server error suppression is disabled), by passing special characters to the fuseaction parameter.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - By crafting a URL with malicious JavaScript code in the `fuseaction` parameter.
    - Specifically, `http://www.site.org/index.cfm?fuseaction="><script>document.location="http://silentcode.net"</script>` demonstrates a simple redirect, and `http://www.site.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=fusebox.overview"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` shows cookie extraction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Attacker needs to be able to construct and send a crafted URL.
    - Attacker doesn't need prior authentication or special privileges, and can exploit it remotely if the target website is accessible over the Internet.
