Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `pam_per_user` PAM module. This module allows different authentication mechanisms to be used per user by mapping users to alternate PAM service names. The module caches PAM "subrequest" handles between calls. It fails to check if the user name has changed between authentication attempts, re-using the cached handle from the previous user, leading to an authentication bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Improper caching of PAM "subrequest" handles.
- Failure to validate if the username has changed between authentication requests.
- Re-use of a previous user's authentication context when a different username is supplied.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker who knows the password for one user (`foo` in the example) can authenticate as any other user on the system (`bar` in the example), provided they can trigger a password reset prompt (e.g. by providing an incorrect password first). This allows for privilege escalation and unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local access: A user at a login prompt can exploit the flaw by entering a valid username and an invalid password (to trigger a new login prompt). Then enter a different username and a password associated with the first user.
- Remote Access: This could be exploited remotely by any service utilizing PAM that allows for incorrect authentication attempts resulting in a new login prompt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have valid credentials for at least one user on the system.
- The attacker must be able to interact with a service that uses the vulnerable PAM module (`pam_per_user`), specifically in a way that triggers a new login prompt (e.g. a failed password attempt followed by a new prompt).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was found to be triggered by `/bin/login`. Any application that resets the `PAM_USER` item after the first `pam_authenticate()` call can be exploited.
- The fix involves checking for changes in the username and recreating the subrequest handle if needed.
