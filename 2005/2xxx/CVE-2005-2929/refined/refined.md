  "CVE-2005-2929": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "A command injection vulnerability exists in the lynxcgi URI handler of various vendors' implementations of Lynx, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running Lynx.",
    "root_cause": "A configuration error in the default settings of Lynx's lynxcgi URI handler allows arbitrary websites to specify commands to run as the user running Lynx.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the underlying user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious link, using the 'lynxcgi:' URI handler, that an attacker convinces a target user to follow from within a vulnerable version of Lynx. The 'lynxexec' and 'lynxprog' URI handlers could also be used, but are less commonly compiled into Lynx."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to follow a malicious link.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered via the `lynxcgi:` URI handler. The `lynxexec` and `lynxprog` URI handlers can also be used to trigger the issue but are less frequently compiled. The issue exists because of a configuration error on multiple platforms that allows arbitrary websites to specify commands."
