Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an error in handling ARJ archives containing compressed files with overly long filenames.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in NOD32 Anti-Virus when scanning specially crafted ARJ archives.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system. This means an attacker could potentially gain full control of the affected computer.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted ARJ archive containing compressed files with overly long filenames.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious ARJ archive and have it scanned by a vulnerable NOD32 Anti-Virus installation. This often involves tricking a user into opening the archive, or having it scanned by the antivirus software during a scheduled scan. Archive scanning needs to be enabled on the target system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects NOD32 for Windows NT/2000/2003/XP Trial Version 2.5 (with nod32.002 version 1.033 build 1127), but other versions might be vulnerable as well.
- The issue was discovered by Tan Chew Keong from Secunia Research.
- A fix was made available via online update in version nod32.002 1.034 build 1132.
