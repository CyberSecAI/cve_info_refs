- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a failure in the Novell GroupWise Client application to securely parse the .ini configuration file that contains labels for different views. Specifically, the application doesn't properly handle overly long labels for view settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in how the GroupWise Client parses the configuration file containing view labels. The application fails to check the length of the label strings, allowing an attacker to overwrite a buffer by providing a large string for the label value within the INI configuration file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's machine running the vulnerable GroupWise Client.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the modification of the `GWVW02??.INI` file located on the post office server. An attacker needs to gain access to the server to modify this configuration file for the appropriate language. The filename follows the pattern GWVW02xx.INI, with xx varying based on language.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires access to the Novell GroupWise post office server file system to modify the configuration files. Once the malicious config file is in place, any user that authenticates to a GroupWise client will be vulnerable, when the client parses the manipulated configuration file during startup.
