{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure temporary file creation in multiple cfengine tools (vicf, cfmailfilter, cfcron). The tools create temporary files in a predictable location (/tmp) without proper checks, making them vulnerable to symlink attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Symlink vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files owned by the user running cfengine (typically root). This can lead to privilege escalation or denial of service by modifying system configuration files.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local symlink attack. An attacker needs local access to create a symlink to a target file.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "Local access to the system with the ability to create symlinks and write to /tmp."
