I can't find any info on it either. The CAN entry only shows
'reserved' - not very helpful. I can't figure out a way to see the
patch without having access to a debian machine; anyone know how to
do that (or have a debian box so you can show the patch contents)?

This looks like the patch:
\* Applied patch by Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña to fix insecure
 temporary file creation [debian/patches/010\_CAN-2005-2960\_tmpfile]

On another note, I just noticed that 2.1.16 is the current version on
[cfengine.org](http://cfengine.org) - did I just miss the announcement, or was there one?

<http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/c/cfengine2/cfengine2_2.1.14-1sarge1.diff.gz>

That is linked to from <http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-836> .

It looks like a patch to a Debian-contributed shell script called vicf,
so I don't think general cfengine users need to worry.

For those not as familiar with Debian, here is how I figured that out:

$ URL=<http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/c/cfengine2>
 $ wget -q $URL/cfengine2\_2.1.14-1sarge1.diff.gz
 $ wget -q $URL/cfengine2\_2.1.14-1sarge1.dsc
 $ wget -q $URL/cfengine2\_2.1.14.orig.tar.gz
 $ dpkg-source -x cfengine2\_2.1.14-1sarge1.dsc
 dpkg-source: extracting cfengine2 in cfengine2-2.1.14
 $ cd cfengine2-2.1.14/debian/patches
 $ ls
 010\_CAN-2005-2960\_tmpfile
 $

I included the whole patch below my sig.

Best,
Brendan

Hi Mark, I'd really appreciate if every new release was announced (no
matter how trivial the update). Either here or on a separate
'announce' list.

Thanks,
Jeff

Downloading as we speak. Sometimes bugfix releases are the most eagerly
awaited :)

I may be mistaken, but I believe our patch for correct CFALLCLASSES
initialization when a module is called through PrepModule was not
included. The patch is in:
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-cfengine/2005-08/msg00181.html>

In your Aug 30 reply to the aforementioned message, you mentioned it
would be included once it had been through quality control. Did it
fail somehow? Was there an action we should have taken, e.g. submit
the patch elsewhere than the mailing-list, maybe open an issue on
sourceforge?

Thank you,
 Cedric Ware.

Hi Mark, will this be patched/removed in the next cfengine release?

Thanks,

'[vicf.in](http://vicf.in)' is still in the contrib directory in both the 2.1.16
tarball and in SVN.

$ tar ztf cfengine-2.1.16.tar.gz | grep vicf

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 836-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
October 1st, 2005                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : cfengine2
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary files
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2960

Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered insecure temporary file use
in cfengine2, a tool for configuring and maintaining networked
machines, that can be exploited by a symlink attack to overwrite
arbitrary files owned by the user executing cfengine, which is
probably root.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.14-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your cfengine2 package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-10-02 04:17:53 UTC  ``` From Debian Security Advisory DSA 836-1 CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2960  Javier Fern ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-10-02 04:17:53 UTC  ``` From Debian Security Advisory DSA 836-1 CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2960  Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered insecure temporary file use in cfengine2, a tool for configuring and maintaining networked machines, that can be exploited by a symlink attack to overwrite arbitrary files owned by the user executing cfengine, which is probably root. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-10-02 10:19:25 UTC  ``` Lance/Kurt please verify and advise.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Lance Albertson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-10-02 10:35:41 UTC  ``` Hrm.. I looked into it and couldn't find much information about it and the fix. I just emailed the cfengine list to get some more feedback on the issue. In the meantime, I did notice they had a newer version of cfengine out that I hadn't bumped yet. I'll see about bumping that (even though there is no mention about a security fix in the changelog). ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Lance Albertson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-10-03 06:27:50 UTC  ``` I started the thread [1] on the cfengine mailing list and I got two reponses back. The first [2] one went into detail about the actual vuln being a third-party script thats called vicf. Some of the older ebuilds used to include this because it was in the contrib folder. The latest ebuilds I have in portage right now shouldn't include that script. The second [3] reply was from the actual author of cfengine basically saying the same thing.  My call is that this shouldn't be a problem since I don't include those scripts anymore. I just double checked and I just removed the ebuilds that used to have that file included a few days ago. If anyone hadn't updated cfengine in the last say.. 2-3 months, they may be vuln to this exploit. But this exploit is only if they use the third party scripts.  Let me know if you need more information.  [1] <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.cfengine.general/6713> [2] <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.cfengine.general/6715> [3] <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.cfengine.general/6717> ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-10-03 06:40:14 UTC  ``` OK, we'll consider this one fixed in recent versions, and not worth a GLSA (obscure contrib script). Thanks for investigating this.  Security: feel free to reopen if you disagree. ``` |  |

cfengine package (vicf, cfmailfilter, and cfcron) create and use

temporary files in an insecure way. A local attacker could exploit

this with a symlink attack to create or overwrite arbitrary files with

the privileges of the user running the cfengine program.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : cfengine
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary files
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2960

Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered several insecure temporary
file uses in cfengine, a tool for configuring and maintaining
networked machines, that can be exploited by a symlink attack to
overwrite arbitrary files owned by the user executing cfengine, which
is probably root.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.3-9woody1.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your cfengine package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
