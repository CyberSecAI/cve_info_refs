Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2977:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the SELinux patch for PAM's `unix_chkpwd` utility. Specifically, when SELinux is enabled, the patch bypasses the verification of the requesting user. Instead of verifying if the user specified in the command line matches the actual user executing `unix_chkpwd`, it directly uses the provided username (`argv[1]`). This effectively disables a security check designed to prevent unauthorized password verification.
- The intended behavior of `unix_chkpwd` was to verify if the requesting user matches the target user for the password check. SELinux was intended to block direct access to `/etc/shadow` and thus prevent password guessing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the bypass of user verification in `unix_chkpwd` when SELinux is enabled.
- **Lack of Delay/Logging:** The `unix_chkpwd` utility does not implement any delay or logging of failed password attempts, which makes brute-force attacks easier to conduct.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to brute-force passwords in `/etc/shadow`, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts and escalating privileges on SELinux-enabled systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have a shell access to the system where `unix_chkpwd` is available.
- **Direct execution of `unix_chkpwd`**:  The attacker needs to be able to execute the `unix_chkpwd` utility. This can be done by executing it directly or through other programs (like `su`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must have a local user account on the target system.
- **Command Execution:** The attacker must have the ability to execute commands, specifically `unix_chkpwd`.
- **SELinux enabled:** The system must have SELinux enabled, though it was later noted to be exploitable even in permissive mode or with non-strict policies.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The bug was initially discovered in Fedora Core 3 and 4, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.
- The vulnerability affects all PAM versions with the flawed SELinux patch.
- A patch was initially proposed to introduce a 2-second delay after a failed attempt, similar to the delay in `su`.
- There was discussion about whether to completely remove the `if(SELINUX_ENABLED)` portion of the patch in RHEL4, as a strict SELinux policy was not shipped with RHEL4.
- A fix was later proposed to check if the user is root, in addition to checking if SELinux is enabled.
- The issue was resolved by an errata that updated the pam package (`RHSA-2005-805`).
- The bug report also notes that using PAM for httpd authentication (specifically with subversion) was not intended and could create a security risk regardless of the vulnerability.
- Gentoo also released a GLSA (200510-22) to address this issue.

**Summary of the fix:**
The fix implemented in the `pam` package addressed the authentication bypass issue with `unix_chkpwd` by correctly verifying the requesting user even when SELinux is enabled. The updated packages also included a delay after a failed password attempt.
