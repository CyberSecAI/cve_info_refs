| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=168181#c0)  Tomas Mraz    2005-09-13 09:55:48 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #168180](show_bug.cgi?id=168180 "CLOSED ERRATA - CAN-2005-2977 unix_chkpwd helper doesn't verify requesting user if SELinux is enabled") for RHEL4 +++  Description of problem:   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): all pam with the SELinux patch included (FC3,4 RHEL4)  How reproducible:  Try: $ echo -n <root password> | /sbin/unix_chkpwd root nonull && echo OK  OK should not be printed.   So the problem is in this part of SELinux patch:         /* -        * determine the current user's name is +        * determine the current user's name is. +        * On a SELinux enabled system, policy will prevent third parties from using +        * unix_chkpwd as a password guesser.  Leaving the existing check prevents +        * su from working,  Since the current uid is the users and the password is +        * for root.          */ -       user = getuidname(getuid()); -       if (argc == 2) { -           /* if the caller specifies the username, verify that user -              matches it */ -           if (strcmp(user, argv[1])) { -               force_failure = 1; -           } +       if (SELINUX_ENABLED) { +         user=argv[1]; +       } +       else { +         user = getuidname(getuid()); +         /* if the caller specifies the username, verify that user +            matches it */ +         if (strcmp(user, argv[1])) { +           return PAM_AUTH_ERR; +         } +       }  Obviously when you set SELinux to permissive mode it's possible to run unix_chkpwd without problem. But even when I set it to enforcing I was able to run it. (Probably it's disabled only by strict policy?)  So unix_chkpwd allows brute-forcing of any passwords in /etc/shadow. Also note that there is no delay if the password is incorrect - it exits immediately, and there is no logging of failed attempts.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=168181#c1)  Daniel Walsh    2005-09-14 16:30:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 118806](attachment.cgi?id=118806&action=diff "Add delay to unix_chkpwd on failure.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=118806&action=edit "Add delay to unix_chkpwd on failure.") Add delay to unix_chkpwd on failure.  Here is a patch that adds a 2 second delay after failure if SELinux is called.  Similar to what would happen if you called su.	Only problem with this patch is it will double timeout of other apps using pam's delay function.  Also this does not prevent user from doing a verify  unix_chkpwd root verify < /dev/null 12959:0:99999:7:-1:-1  Which I am not sure is a security problem.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=168181#c2)  Tomas Mraz    2005-09-15 12:58:28 UTC  ``` I'd prefer to remove the if(SELINUX_ENABLED) part of the original patch for RHEL4 as we don't ship strict policy for RHEL4. Then we can think about and test a better patch for a next update release.    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=168181#c4)  Daniel Walsh    2005-09-15 14:01:42 UTC  ``` A simple fix for this would be    if (SELINUX_ENABLED  && getuid() == 0) { +         user=argv[1]; +       } +       else { +         user = getuidname(getuid()); +         /* if the caller specifies the username, verify that user +            matches it */ +         if (strcmp(user, argv[1])) { +           return PAM_AUTH_ERR; +         } +       }  This app will only be run as root when SELinux is blocking access to the /etc/shadow.  I believe this fixes the problem with out changing the behavior at all.    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=168181#c5)  Tomas Mraz    2005-09-15 14:39:01 UTC  ``` This is what I propose too but it would work only if the setuid(0) call was added after the fork before exec-ing unix_chkpwd in pam_unix module.  Otherwise su, sudo, userhelper won't work (they call setuid later in the process).    ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=168181#c6)  Tomas Mraz    2005-10-07 15:32:10 UTC  ``` Please see also [bug 168180](show_bug.cgi?id=168180 "CLOSED ERRATA - CAN-2005-2977 unix_chkpwd helper doesn't verify requesting user if SELinux is enabled") for discussion.    ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=168181#c11)  Josh Bressers    2005-10-26 15:45:59 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo, this issue is now public.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=168181#c12)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2005-10-26 15:56:28 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-805.html>    ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=168181#c13)  Jay Levitt    2005-11-16 17:47:42 UTC  ``` Installing the official RHEL4 pam-0.77-66.13 from this errata breaks subversion-via-httpd's ability to use pam_unix for authentication.    Specifically:  I'm running RHEL AS4 for 32-bit x86. When I install the updated pam rpm, I'm no longer able to use pam_unix to authenticate mod_dav_svn.  I get the following error in /var/log/messages when attempting to login with a subversion client:  Nov 15 19:56:25 dev httpd(pam_unix)[31001]: authentication failure; logname= uid=48 euid=48 tty= ruser= rhost=  user=jay  (UID 48 is the apache login.)  Rolling back to pam-0.77-66.11 solves the problem.  I have no problem using pam_unix to authenticate regular web directories, only subversion repositories, which seems like a good clue.  I don't know enough to know if this is a bug in the errata, or a bug in the way mod_dav_svn works.  Maybe it doesn't ask for the right privileges, but the former pam bug was letting it get away with that?  If so, I will report to the subversion team.  I'm running Apache httpd 2.0.54, installed from source, with subversion 1.2.3, likewise.  Snippets of my httpd.conf:  ..the regular web site, which works fine...  <Directory "/srv/www/htdocs/my.site.example.com">        Options +Indexes        IndexIgnore ..         SSLRequireSSL        AuthPAM_Enabled On        AuthType Basic        AuthName "Development Intranet"        Require valid-user </Directory>  ..the subversion repository, which fails as soon as the errata RPM is installed...  <VirtualHost *:443>        ServerName svn.example.com        CustomLog logs/svn.access.log combined        SSLEngine On         # This must be accessible, but is otherwise unused        DocumentRoot "/srv/www/htdocs/svn-phony"         <Location /dev/>                AuthPAM_Enabled on                AuthType Basic                AuthName "Developer repository"                Require group dev        </Location>         <Location />                DAV svn                SVNParentPath "/srv/svn/"                SVNPathAuthz off        </Location>  </VirtualHost>  .. my /etc/pam.d/httpd config ...  #%PAM-1.0 auth       required     /lib/security/pam_unix.so account    required     /lib/security/pam_unix.so     ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=168181#c14)  Tomas Mraz    2005-11-16 21:02:20 UTC  ``` This was never intended to work - for example if you've had turned SELinux off with the previous pam release it wouldn't work either.  It is not too good idea to authenticate httpd against unix accounts and passwords anyway. Couldn't the subversion via httpd be authenticating against its own password database? Of course if you don't care about security too much you can make /etc/shadow readable for the apache group or not to use shadow passwords at all although I wouldn't recommend doing anything like that.    ``` |  |

# SELinux PAM: Local password guessing attack — GLSA **200510-22**

A vulnerability in the SELinux version of PAM allows a local attacker to
brute-force system passwords.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/pam** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.78-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.78-r3** |

### Background

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is an architecture allowing
the separation of the development of privilege granting software from
the development of secure and appropriate authentication schemes.
SELinux is an operating system based on Linux which includes Mandatory
Access Control.

### Description

The SELinux patches for PAM introduce a vulnerability allowing a
password to be checked with the unix\_chkpwd utility without delay or
logging. This vulnerability doesn't affect users who do not run
SELinux.

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to brute-force
passwords and escalate privileges on an SELinux system.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SELinux PAM users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/pam-0.78-r3"
```
