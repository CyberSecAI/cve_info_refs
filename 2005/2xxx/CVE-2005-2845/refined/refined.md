Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The reported vulnerability stems from the Ariba Spend Management System potentially transmitting user credentials (username and password) in plain text. Specifically, the initial report suggests these credentials are being passed within the URL. However, a follow-up response from Ariba clarified that credentials are not embedded in the URL, rather they are sent via form post. The underlying issue, as pointed out in the response, is the use of unencrypted HTTP, which results in all data being transmitted in clear text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Transmission:** The core vulnerability is the transmission of sensitive data (user credentials) in plaintext over HTTP when the application is not configured to use HTTPS. This allows eavesdropping on network traffic to expose the data.
*   **Misconfiguration:** The vulnerability is not directly an application flaw, but rather a consequence of the application being used on a web server configured to use unencrypted HTTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can intercept the communication and extract usernames and passwords, potentially gaining access to user accounts within the Ariba system.
*   **Unauthorized Purchases:** With access to accounts, especially those in an 'approval' role (e.g., CFO, CTO, CEO), the attacker could make unauthorized purchases within the Ariba system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Compromised high-level accounts may give the attacker extensive access and control within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker positioned on the same network as a user could intercept the HTTP traffic using packet capture tools (e.g., Wireshark) to sniff out the credentials.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** A more sophisticated attack could involve positioning an attacker as a man-in-the-middle, intercepting and potentially modifying the traffic between the user and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between a user's browser and the web server hosting the Ariba application, either through network access or by being on the same network.
*   **Sniffing Tools:** The attacker would need packet capture tools to analyze the network traffic and extract the plaintext credentials.
*   **Understanding of Ariba System:**  While not strictly necessary for the initial credential theft, understanding how the Ariba system works and what privileges certain accounts have would be required to leverage the stolen credentials for unauthorized purchases and other malicious actions.

**Additional Notes:**

The response from Ariba mentions that they recommend HTTPS in production environments and provide safeguards to prevent HTTP usage; however, the fact that it is possible indicates a vulnerability of configuration and not necessarily the application itself.
