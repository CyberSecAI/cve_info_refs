  "cve_id": "CVE-2005-2268",
  "description": "It is possible for a Javascript dialog box to spoof a dialog box from a trusted site and facilitates phishing attacks.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises because JavaScript dialog boxes (prompts, alerts) do not clearly display the origin of the script that created them. They present with a generic title which can be exploited by malicious pages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate origin indication in JavaScript dialogs.",
      "Lack of distinction between trusted and untrusted prompts."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious webpage could create a spoofed dialog box that appears to come from a trusted site. This can trick users into providing sensitive information such as passwords, enabling phishing attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious webpage can trigger a JavaScript dialog box.",
       "The dialog box can be positioned to overlap a trusted site's interface."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to host a webpage that can execute JavaScript. The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting their malicious webpage.",
    "additional_details": "The fix for this vulnerability involves displaying the hostname of the page that created the dialog in the dialog's title, helping users to identify the source. Workarounds such as dragging the prompt to ensure no hidden windows exist are also recommended."
