      "content": "The `pwmconfig` script in `lm-sensors`, which is used to probe fan controls and generate a configuration file, uses a hardcoded filename `/tmp/fancontrol` to create temporary files. This allows for a symlink attack where a local user could create a symlink to an arbitrary file, causing `pwmconfig` to overwrite that file. The fix implemented uses `tempfile` to create a temporary file with a unique name.",
      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The `pwmconfig` script uses a hardcoded filename in `/tmp` for temporary files, making it vulnerable to symlink attacks.",

          "Insecure temporary file creation",
          "Symlink vulnerability"

          "Local access",
          "Symlink manipulation"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be a local user with the ability to create symlinks.",
		"additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because the temporary file `/tmp/fancontrol` is created with a predictable name. An attacker can create a symlink with the same name pointing to another arbitrary file on the system. When the vulnerable script attempts to write to the temporary file, it will instead write to the attacker's target file. The fix replaces the hardcoded file creation with the use of the `tempfile` utility. This ensures that the temporary file has a unique, unpredictable name and prevents symlink attacks."

The `pwmconfig` script creates temporary files with a predictable filename, allowing local users to overwrite arbitrary files through symlink manipulation.
