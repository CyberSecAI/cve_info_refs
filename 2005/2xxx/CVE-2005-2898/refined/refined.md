The provided content relates to CVE-2005-2898.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The FileZilla client stores passwords using a weak XOR "encryption" with a static, hardcoded key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Weak Encryption:** The use of XOR with a static key is easily reversible.
- **Hardcoded Key:** The encryption key is embedded within the source code, making it easily discoverable.
- **Lack of Proper Protection:**  The passwords are not protected with a strong cryptographic algorithm.
- **Plaintext Storage (Partial):** While the password is "encrypted," other sensitive information like hostname, port, and username are stored in cleartext within configuration files or the registry.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credentials Theft:** An attacker can easily decrypt stored passwords, gaining access to FTP/SFTP servers using the victim's credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, server compromise, and other malicious activities.
- **Lateral Movement:** In a compromised environment, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to move laterally and gain control of other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Machine:** An attacker who has gained access to a user's machine can directly retrieve and decrypt the stored passwords.
- **Malicious Code:** A malicious program can be used to steal the configuration settings, decrypt passwords, and send them to the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the user's machine where the FileZilla configuration settings are stored.
- **Knowledge of the Key:** The attacker needs to know the hardcoded XOR key, which is publicly available through source code analysis.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker requires the ability to execute code on the target system to extract/decrypt the password

The provided content offers additional details, including:

- Specific versions affected: 2.2.14b and 2.2.15 (suspected also for previous versions)
- Location of the configuration files and registry keys:
   - XML file: `%programfiles%\FileZilla\FileZilla.xml`
   - Registry: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\FileZilla\Site Manager\[site_name]\Pass`
- The hardcoded key: `"FILEZILLA1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"`
- Proof-of-concept (PoC) code in C, demonstrating how to decrypt the passwords.
- A suggested solution: Use "secure mode" or patch to a fixed version.
