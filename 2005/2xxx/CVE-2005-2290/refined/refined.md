```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `wps_shop.cgi` script, specifically in the `showartikel` subroutine. The script directly uses the `$info{'art'}` parameter to construct a file path without filtering special characters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote command execution due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the remote host by injecting malicious characters into the `$info{'art'}` parameter.",
  "Attack vectors": "By adding special parameters to the `wps_shop.cgi` script, an attacker can manipulate the file path used in the `open()` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `wps_shop.cgi` script and control the `art` parameter."
