```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The BusinessMail email server system version 4.60.00 does not properly check or filter input to the SMTP HELO and MAIL FROM commands.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow
- Impact of exploitation: Sending a long argument to the HELO and MAIL FROM commands causes the corresponding process to terminate, resulting in a denial-of-service.
- Attack vectors: Sending crafted SMTP commands via a network connection to port 25.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to connect to the SMTP service (port 25) on the target server and send crafted commands.
