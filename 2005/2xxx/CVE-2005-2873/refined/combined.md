| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=202412#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-08-14 09:55:27 UTC  ``` The proposed patch for [CVE-2005-2872](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-2872) was rejected by upstream. The Linux kernel 2.6.18-rc1 now contains a fully rewritten version of ipt_recent.c from Patrick McHardy. Is this acceptable for a backport?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=202412#c8)  Neil Horman    2006-09-01 17:30:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 135397](attachment.cgi?id=135397&action=diff "patch to update ipt_recent module to latest upstream code") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=135397&action=edit "patch to update ipt_recent module to latest upstream code") patch to update ipt_recent module to latest upstream code  I spent some time last night to generate the patch that updates our current ipt_recent code to the latest upstream version.  Its ABI compatibile as far as I've been able to see, and it builds without warnings for me.  Can you please give it a test and confirm its functionality for me?  Thanks   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=202412#c10)  Jay Turner    2006-10-03 13:26:02 UTC  ``` QE is concerned about testing this fix.  We need some guidance on testing before we can ack this request.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=202412#c11)  Neil Horman    2006-10-03 14:10:36 UTC  ``` I built a custom kernel to start jiffies > LONG_MAX, but I think on 32 bit systems it should roll over anyway within the first 5 minutes after boot.  Basically, all you need to do is set up an iptable rule to do an ipt_recent module --check operation of a source ip on a given port and drop the packet if its found, along with a --seconds 30 to narrow the search to the last 30 seconds. then a second subsequent rule to add the source ip to the table.  the effect here should be that one can contact the specified port on the system (I used the telnet daemon to test) once every 30 seconds.  Addition connect attempts will be dropped.  When the bug is in place, once an entry is added to the table it will (incorrectly) always be found, and the matching packets will always be dropped.  with the fix, packets will be allowed through once every 30 seconds   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=202412#c12)  RHEL Program Management    2006-10-10 18:16:39 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux maintenance release.  Product Management has requested further review of this request by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update release for currently deployed products.  This request is not yet committed for inclusion in an Update release.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=202412#c13)  Jay Turner    2006-10-17 15:35:07 UTC  ``` QE ack for RHEL4.5.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=202412#c14)  Jason Baron    2006-10-23 19:19:26 UTC  ``` committed in stream U5 build 42.20. A test kernel with this patch is available from <http://people.redhat.com/~jbaron/rhel4/>    ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=202412#c16)  Mike Gahagan    2007-04-04 17:40:43 UTC  ``` I'm not able to reproduce the original problem but I did test the ipt_recent functionality and it appears to be working as expected. I have also verified that the patch to update ipt_recent is in the -52 kernel.      ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=202412#c18)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-05-08 03:18:49 UTC  ``` An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=202735#c0)  Charalampos.tsimenidis@ncl.ac.uk    2006-08-16 02:30:32 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The snd-azx sound driver in the latest RHEL4 kernel (2.6.9-42.EL)  is broken on my Dell precision workstation 380 (sigmatel). I don't get any errors while loading the driver and everything seems to be ok with the mixer but no sound is coming out and the mixer is unmuted.   Downgrading to 2.6.9-34.0.2.EL seems to fix the problem.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 2.6.9-42.EL  How reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: 1. Boot into kernel-2.6.9-34.0.2.EL: sound ok 2. Boot into kernel-2.6.9-42.EL: no sound    Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info: Sound entry in /etc/modprobe.conf  alias snd-card-0 snd-azx options snd-card-0 index=0 install snd-azx /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd-azx && /usr/sbin/alsactl restore >/dev/null 2>&1 || : remove snd-azx { /usr/sbin/alsactl store >/dev/null 2>&1 || : ; }; /sbin/modprobe -r --ignore-remove snd-azx   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=202735#c1)  John W. Linville    2006-08-22 17:57:03 UTC  ``` Test kernels w/ update azx driver available here:     <http://people.redhat.com/linville/kernels/rhel4/>  Please give them a try and post the results here...thanks!   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=202735#c2)  Charalampos.tsimenidis@ncl.ac.uk    2006-08-23 13:58:17 UTC  ``` For some reason the modules snd-azx.ko and snd-hda-codec.ko are not included  in the test kernel (kernel-2.6.9-42.2.EL.jwltest.158.i686.rpm) !  $rpm -ql kernel-2.6.9-42.2.EL.jwltest.158 | grep azx returns an empty string.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=202735#c3)  John W. Linville    2006-08-23 17:25:15 UTC  ``` I'm terribly sorry -- I screwed-up a Makefile during the update...  It is fixed in the kernels available now at the same location as in [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=202735#c1).   Please try again?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=202735#c4)  Charalampos.tsimenidis@ncl.ac.uk    2006-08-23 18:57:57 UTC  ``` I still see the old rpm packages without the azx driver.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=202735#c5)  John W. Linville    2006-08-23 19:12:38 UTC  ``` Seems to be there now?

I've been running an SMP 2.6.9-42.0.3.EL kernel patched with jwltest-azx-broadwater.patch with no problems since the release of 42.0.3.EL   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=202735#c12)  John W. Linville    2006-10-25 19:04:32 UTC  ``` Oh, sorry -- sloppy cut and paste...  It should have read "location from [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=202735#c1)", and the "...th" should have  been "...thanks!" :-)  Andrew, thanks for the confirmation.  Charalampos & tjb, are either  2.6.9-42.0.3.EL or the current test kernels working for you as well?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=202735#c13)  Thomas J.

I have followed yor recommendations that you gave Charalampos, but the kernel has changed since this ticket was opened.  I have loaded the kernel /2.6.9-42.30.EL-largesmp-x86_64 from site: <http://people.redhat.com/~jbaron/rhel4/RPMS.kernel/>  When I do a rpm tp determine if it is included, it looks as thoug it is but I am still not getting the sound to work.  Do you have any ideas?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
