```
Root cause of vulnerability: polygen generates precompiled grammar objects with world-writable permissions.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure file permissions (world-writable).
Impact of exploitation: A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to fill up the filesystem, leading to a denial of service.
Attack vectors: Local access to the system is required.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have local access to the system to be able to write to the world-writable files generated by polygen.
