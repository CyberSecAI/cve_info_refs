The provided content relates to CVE-2005-2041.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `addschup` CGI binary of the Global Hauri ViRobot Server. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the `ViRobot_ID` cookie value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `addschup` binary copies the `ViRobot_ID` cookie value into a 32-byte buffer without proper length validation. If the cookie value exceeds this length, a buffer overflow occurs.
- **Insecure Cookie Usage:** The server uses cookie-based authentication, but doesn't adequately validate the size of the data stored within the cookie.
- **Setuid Binary:** The vulnerable `addschup` binary is setuid root, allowing an attacker to execute code with elevated privileges.
- **Crontab Manipulation:** The overflow allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the root user's crontab file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the root user's crontab, leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain root access to the system through the crafted crontab entry, enabling them to execute any command on the system.
- **System Compromise:** Full system compromise can be achieved, allowing an attacker to gain complete control over the affected server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/addschup` endpoint.
- **Cookie Manipulation:** The malicious payload is injected through a crafted `ViRobot_ID` cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the affected ViRobot Server.
- **HTTP Client:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests.
- **Understanding of HTTP and Cookies:** Basic understanding of HTTP POST requests and cookie manipulation is necessary.
