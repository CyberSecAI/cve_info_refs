Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2005-2995:

**Root Cause:** Insecure temporary file creation in multiple Bacula scripts. Specifically, the scripts create temporary files in `/tmp` using predictable names and then use those files in operations. This leads to race conditions that can be exploited via symlink attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Symlink Attacks (Race Condition):**
    *   Scripts create temporary files in `/tmp` with predictable filenames (e.g., `p.tmp.$$`, `/tmp/1$$`, `/tmp/mtx.$$`).
    *   An attacker can create a symbolic link with the same name as the temporary file before the script creates it. When the vulnerable script tries to write to the temporary file, it will actually write to the attacker's file or location specified in the symlink, allowing for arbitrary file creation or overwriting.
    *   This is due to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition.
2.  **Password Revelation (Race Condition):**
    *   In `autoconf/randpass`, the script generates a random password and writes it to a temporary file in `/tmp`.
    *   An attacker could potentially read the temporary file in `/tmp` before the script does, revealing the password.
    *   This is a vulnerability when `openssl` isn't available on the system.
3.  **Arbitrary Command Execution (Race Condition):**
    *   In `rescue/linux/getdiskinfo`, the script creates mount scripts and stores it into a temporary file `/tmp/1$$`. An attacker can use a symlink attack on `/tmp/1$$` to inject arbitrary commands. The injected commands would be executed when `mount_drives` script is executed.
4. **Uncontrolled working directory:**
    * Several scripts define the `working_directory` variable as `/tmp`. It is necessary to review the use of this variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwriting:** An attacker can create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user running the affected script. This could lead to privilege escalation or denial of service.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read temporary files created by the script, potentially revealing sensitive information such as generated passwords.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Through symlink attacks, arbitrary commands can be executed with user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access to the system is required.
*   Attacker needs to be able to create files in `/tmp` directory and create symlinks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a local user account with the ability to execute code on the target system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create files and symlinks in `/tmp`.

**Vulnerable scripts:**

*   `autoconf/randpass`
*   `rescue/linux/getdiskinfo`
*    `scripts/mtx-changer.in`

**Affected versions:**
*   Bacula <= 1.36.3

**Solution**
* Update to version 1.37.39
