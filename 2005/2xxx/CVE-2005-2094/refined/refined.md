The provided content discusses HTTP Request Smuggling and is relevant to CVE-2005-2094, as the CVE description mentions "HTTP Request Smuggling".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from discrepancies in how different HTTP devices (e.g., cache servers, proxy servers, web application firewalls) parse malformed HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the failure of HTTP servers or devices to properly handle malformed inbound HTTP requests. This leads to inconsistent interpretations of requests by different entities in the data flow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation can lead to various attacks, including:
    - Web cache poisoning: Associating a URL with the content of another URL, leading to serving incorrect content.
    - Session hijacking: Manipulating the server's request/response sequencing to steal credentials.
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS).
    - Bypassing web application firewall protection: Smuggling malicious requests (e.g., worms, buffer overflows) to the web server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests designed to be interpreted differently by different HTTP entities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests and requires knowledge of how the different entities in the data flow will parse the crafted requests to exploit the parsing discrepancies.
