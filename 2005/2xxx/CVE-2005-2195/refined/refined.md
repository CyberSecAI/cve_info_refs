Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2195:

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way the Darwin Streaming Server's web-based administration application handles HTTP requests for MS-DOS device names with a `.cgi` extension. Specifically requesting a MS-DOS device name with a `.cgi` extension over HTTP triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** The server is susceptible to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to improper handling of specific malformed HTTP requests.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service, preventing legitimate users from accessing the Darwin Streaming Server.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP GET request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by requesting a MS-DOS device name (e.g., `AUX`) with a `.cgi` extension over HTTP.
*   The specific request is of the form: `GET /AUX.cgi HTTP/1.0`
*   This vulnerability is distinct from previously reported vulnerabilities CAN-2003-0421 and CAN-2003-0502.

**Affected Software:**

*   Apple Darwin Streaming Server 5.5 and below (for Win32).

**Vendor Response:**

*   Apple was notified of the vulnerability on 2005-06-27.
*   Apple released a patched version, Darwin Streaming Server 5.5.1, on 2005-07-12.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Darwin Streaming Server version 5.5.1 or later.
