  "date": "2005-10-05",
  "description": "Multiple boundary errors when reading the filename of a compressed file from ALZ, ARJ, ZIP, UUE or XXE archives can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow (ALZ), or a heap-based buffer overflow (ARJ / ZIP / UUE / XXE). Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a malicious ALZ / ARJ archive is opened, or when a ZIP / UUE / XXE archive is extracted.",
