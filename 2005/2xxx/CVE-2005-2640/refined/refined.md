{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The IKE implementation in Juniper Netscreen's ScreenOS responds differently to valid usernames than to invalid usernames during IKE Aggressive Mode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Username enumeration vulnerability due to inconsistent responses in IKE Aggressive Mode.",
      "Lack of rate limiting or account lockout for failed username attempts.",
	   "Use of easily brute-forceable pre-shared keys for authentication",
      "Vulnerability to offline password cracking after obtaining a valid username.",
	   "Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) vulnerability against XAUTH if used as a second level of authentication."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can enumerate valid usernames, crack passwords, gain unauthorized VPN access, potentially perform MitM attacks if XAUTH is in use to snoop, alter VPN traffic, or access the network protected by the VPN.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending IKE Aggressive Mode packets with different usernames in the Identity (ID) payload to determine valid ones.",
      "Offline password cracking after obtaining valid username and hash.",
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack against XAUTH to intercept and modify traffic or gain access to the network."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send IKE Aggressive Mode packets to a target Netscreen device.",
      "Tools to perform dictionary or brute-force attacks on usernames.",
      "Tools to perform offline password cracking.",
      "Ability to perform a MitM attack if XAUTH is in use"
    ],
        "affected_versions": "All models of Juniper Netscreen running all ScreenOS software versions up to 5.2.0."
