  UNIX RealPlayer && Helix Player
  <http://real.com>
  <http://helixcommunity.org>

  "The Helix Player is the Helix Community's open source media player for consumers. \
It is being developed  to have a rich and usable graphical interface and support a \
variety of open media formats like Ogg Vorbis,  Theora etc.
  The RealPlayer for Linux is built on top of the Helix Player for Linux and includes \
support for several  non-open source components including RealAudio/RealVideo, MP3 \
etc."

  There is a remotly exploitable format string vulnerability in the latest Helix \
Media Player suit that will  allow an attacker the possibility to execute malicious \
code on a victims computer. The exploit code will  execute a remote shell under the \
permissions of the user running the media player, and effects all versions  of \
RealPlayer and Helix Player.

  The bug is exploitable by abusing media, including .rp (relpix)and .rt (realtext) \
file formats. Although  others may be effected I stick to realpix file format for \
this advisory.

  Almost all media file input is placed on the heap, so it's not possible to just pop \
our way to a supplied  string like with a normal stack based format bug, as such we \
can't directly modify GOT, DTORS, etc. leaving  us limited to what we can do.

  There are several places where we can control the flow of execution:

       popN - call *0x04(eax) - eax is controlled
       popN+N - call *0x20(eax) - eax is controlled
       popN+NN - call *0x100(edx) - edx is controlled
       popN+NNN - ebp - ebp is controlled
       popN+NNNN - eip - eip is controlled
       ....

  however since we are limited to the size of the value that can be written, it \
doesn't seem possible to  point at a known good location directly. Since our \
shellcode is always mapped via the .rp file between  0x0822**** - 0x082f**** and with \
control of one pointer at a time usually, we can not reach the LSB, we  are toast.

  In a phrack paper, Riq talks about using sections of the base pointer to create a 4 \
byte pointer by  chaining EBP like so:

  [Frame 10 EBP]--points to-->[Frame 11 EBP]--points to-->[Frame 12 EBP]

  And can be manipulated something like so:

  --------     --------     --------
  Frame 10     Frame 11     Frame 12
  --------     --------     --------
                1|------------\/
  [LSBMSB]     [LSBMSB]--   [41414141]
      2|____________^  3|__________^

  Well, it doesn't work :-( ..ebp gets moved to esp in frame 11 and it ends with EIP \
pointing at 0x00000000.

  So what else can I do?

  How about use the fact the file being played is under my control and only the MSB \
needs overwritten. This  solves the problem with the size of the valaue I can write. \
It is possible to modify the MSB of an EBP  that is reachable, eventually leading to \
EIP pointing at some good location after "mov %ebp,%esp" happens,  resulting in the \
execution of our shellcode.

	1-> Create a file with shellcode address `printf "\x37\x13\x12\x08"`.rp
	2-> Overwrite EBP MSB with the address of the file location on the stack
	3-> EBP is moved to ESP
	4-> EIP is changed to ESP value
	5-> EIP is owned, shell is spawned

  Granted this is not a stable method as the user can freely manipulate their \
environment, and we use the  file name, which is stored in an environment variable to \
trampoline us to the shellcode. However my goal  here is not to create a worm but a \
proof-of-concept  :p

  The supplied POC should work flawlessly on Debian 3.1, with RealPlayer installed in \
/usr/local/RealPlayer  and run as shown below.

  To exploit this remotly, a user just needs to place the created file on a web site \
and provide a link so  users can click the file, launching RealPlayer and exploiting \
the vulnerability.

  Real have been duely informed about this issue and are fixing. Sadly though, it \
seems someone is trying to  pinch my research, as such I have been forced to release \
this advisory sooner than hoped. Until Real get  a new release out, do not play \
untrusted media with RealPlayer or HelixPlayer. Sorry Real.com!

  Moral of the story, don't talk about personal research on IRC. Thank you \
plagiarizers.

  PS: A new RSS feed for the latest 5 Open Security Group Advisories, @ \

  To exploit this remotly, a user just needs to place the created file
on a web site and provide a link so
  users can click the file, launching RealPlayer and exploiting the
vulnerability.

  Real have been duely informed about this issue and are fixing. Sadly
though, it seems someone is trying to
  pinch my research, as such I have been forced to release this
advisory sooner than hoped. Until Real get
  a new release out, do not play untrusted media with RealPlayer or
HelixPlayer. Sorry Real.com!

  Moral of the story, don't talk about personal research on IRC. Thank
you plagiarizers.

UNIX RealPlayer && Helix Player
http://real.com
http://helixcommunity.org
"The Helix Player is the Helix Community's open source media player for consumers. \
It is being developed to have a rich and usable graphical interface and support a \
variety of open media formats like Ogg Vorbis, Theora etc.
The RealPlayer for Linux is built on top of the Helix Player for Linux and includes \
support for several non-open source components including RealAudio/RealVideo, MP3 \
etc."
There is a remotly exploitable format string vulnerability in the latest Helix \
Media Player suit that will allow an attacker the possibility to execute malicious \
code on a victims computer. The exploit code will execute a remote shell under the \
permissions of the user running the media player, and effects all versions of \
RealPlayer and Helix Player.
The bug is exploitable by abusing media, including .rp (relpix)and .rt (realtext) \
file formats. Although others may be effected I stick to realpix file format for \
this advisory.
Almost all media file input is placed on the heap, so it's not possible to just pop \
our way to a supplied string like with a normal stack based format bug, as such we \
can't directly modify GOT, DTORS, etc. leaving us limited to what we can do.
There are several places where we can control the flow of execution:
popN - call \*0x04(eax) - eax is controlled
popN+N - call \*0x20(eax) - eax is controlled
popN+NN - call \*0x100(edx) - edx is controlled
popN+NNN - ebp - ebp is controlled
popN+NNNN - eip - eip is controlled
....
however since we are limited to the size of the value that can be written, it \
doesn't seem possible to point at a known good location directly. Since our \
shellcode is always mapped via the .rp file between 0x0822\*\*\*\* - 0x082f\*\*\*\* and with \
control of one pointer at a time usually, we can not reach the LSB, we are toast.
In a phrack paper, Riq talks about using sections of the base pointer to create a 4 \
byte pointer by chaining EBP like so:
[Frame 10 EBP]--points to-->[Frame 11 EBP]--points to-->[Frame 12 EBP]
And can be manipulated something like so:
-------- -------- --------
Frame 10 Frame 11 Frame 12
-------- -------- --------
1|------------\/
[LSBMSB] [LSBMSB]-- [41414141]
2|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_^ 3|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_^
Well, it doesn't work :-( ..ebp gets moved to esp in frame 11 and it ends with EIP \
pointing at 0x00000000.
So what else can I do?
How about use the fact the file being played is under my control and only the MSB \
needs overwritten. This solves the problem with the size of the valaue I can write. \
It is possible to modify the MSB of an EBP that is reachable, eventually leading to \
EIP pointing at some good location after "mov %ebp,%esp" happens, resulting in the \
execution of our shellcode.
1-> Create a file with shellcode address `printf "\x37\x13\x12\x08"`.rp
2-> Overwrite EBP MSB with the address of the file location on the stack
3-> EBP is moved to ESP
4-> EIP is changed to ESP value
5-> EIP is owned, shell is spawned
Granted this is not a stable method as the user can freely manipulate their \
environment, and we use the file name, which is stored in an environment variable to \
trampoline us to the shellcode. However my goal here is not to create a worm but a \
proof-of-concept :p
The supplied POC should work flawlessly on Debian 3.1, with RealPlayer installed in \
/usr/local/RealPlayer and run as shown below.

...
To exploit this remotly, a user just needs to place the created file on a web site \
and provide a link so users can click the file, launching RealPlayer and exploiting \
the vulnerability.
Real have been duely informed about this issue and are fixing. Sadly though, it \
seems someone is trying to pinch my research, as such I have been forced to release \
this advisory sooner than hoped. Until Real get a new release out, do not play \
untrusted media with RealPlayer or HelixPlayer. Sorry Real.com!
Moral of the story, don't talk about personal research on IRC. Thank you \
plagiarizers.

# RealPlayer, Helix Player: Format string vulnerability — GLSA **200510-07**

RealPlayer and Helix Player are vulnerable to a format string vulnerability
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/realplayer** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **10.0.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **10.0.6** |

| Package | **media-video/helixplayer** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.6** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

RealPlayer is a multimedia player capable of handling multiple
multimedia file formats. Helix Player is an open source media player
for Linux.

### Description

"c0ntex" reported that RealPlayer and Helix Player suffer from a heap
overflow.

### Impact

By enticing a user to play a specially crafted realpix (.rp) or
realtext (.rt) file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All RealPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/realplayer-10.0.6"
```

Note to Helix Player users: There is currently no stable secure Helix
Player package. Affected users should remove the package until an
updated Helix Player package is released.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 826-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                              Michael Stone
September 29th, 2005                    <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : helix-player
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CAN-2005-1766 CAN-2005-2710
Debian Bug     : 316276 330364

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been identified in the
helix-player media player that could allow an attacker to execute code
on the victim's machine via specially crafted network resources.

CAN-2005-1766

        Buffer overflow in the RealText parser could allow remote code
        execution via a specially crafted RealMedia file with a long
        RealText string.

CAN-2005-2710

        Format string vulnerability in Real HelixPlayer and RealPlayer 10
        allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the image
        handle attribute in a RealPix (.rp) or RealText (.rt) file.

For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-1sarge1

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.6-1

We recommend that you upgrade your helix-player package.

Upgrade Instructions

sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RealNetworks RealPlayer/HelixPlayer RealPix Format String Vulnerability
iDEFENSE Security Advisory 09.30.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=311&type=vulnerabilities
September 30, 2005
I. BACKGROUND
RealPlayer is an application for playing various media formats,
developed by RealNetworks Inc. For more information, visit
http://www.real.com/.
II. DESCRIPTION
Remote exploitation of a format string vulnerability in RealPix (.rp)
file format parser within various versions of RealNetworks Inc.'s
RealPlayer could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
The vulnerability specifically exists because of the improper usage of a
formatted printing function. When a user specifies an invalid value for
the "timeformat" attribute describing a RealPix file, the data is passed
to the function.
The following stripped down .rp file is sufficient enough to trigger the
vulnerability:
<imfl>
<head
title="iDEFENSE Labs RealPix Vulnerability"
timeformat="%n%n%n%n%n%n"/>
</imfl>
III. ANALYSIS
Exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution as the user who opened
the .rp file.
Exploitation requires an attacker to craft a malicious .rp file and
convince a user to open it. An attacker could also trick a user to load
the .rp file from a normal web page under the attacker's control; this
is possible if the user has configured their web browser to handle
RealPlayer formats automatically.
IV. DETECTION
iDEFENSE Labs has confirmed that RealPlayer 10.0.4.750 on Linux is
vulnerable. Windows and Mac versions of RealPlayer are not vulnerable.
FreeBSD versions are suspected vulnerable.
The vendor has indicated that the following versions are vulnerable:
Linux RealPlayer 10 (10.0.0 - 10.0.5)
Helix Player (10.0.0 - 10.0.5)
The following vendors include susceptible RealPlayer packages within
their respective distributions:
The FreeBSD Project: FreeBSD 5.3 and earlier
Novell Inc.: SuSE Linux 9.2
Red Hat Inc.: Desktop v.3 and v.4,
Enterprise Linux AS/ES/WS v.3 and v.4 and Fedora Core 3,
Linux 7.3 and 9
V. WORKAROUND
Filter .rp attachments at e-mail gateways. Educate users about the risks
of accepting files from untrusted individuals.
VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
The vendor had released the following advisory for this vulnerability:
http://service.real.com/help/faq/security/050930\_player/EN/
VII. CVE INFORMATION

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Helix Player format string vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#361181

Original Release Date: 2005-09-28 | Last Revised: 2005-10-04

---

### Overview

Helix Player, and media players based on the Helix Player, contain a format string vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Helix Player is used to play various types of media files on UNIX systems. The Helix Media Player contains a format string vulnerability in the routines that handle media files. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a specially crafted media file, such as a realpix (\*.rp) or realtext (\*.rt) file. In addition, web browsers can be configured to automatically launch the Helix Player when media content is encountered, thus an attack may be triggered by visiting a malicious website.  This issue also affects media players based on the Helix Player, including Real Player for Linux systems. Note there is publicly available exploit code for this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Helix Media Player process. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  This vulnerability was corrected in Helix Player [1.0.6](https://player.helixcommunity.org/2005/releases/hx1gold/HX1_0_6ReleaseNotes.html) and Real Player [10](http://www.real.com/linux) for Linux. |
| --- |

| **Do not access media files from untrusted sources**Accessing media files from trusted or known sources only will reduce the chances of exploitation.  **Disable Helix Player or Real Player for Linux support in the web browser**Configuring a web browser to not automatically launch the Helix Player when media content is encountered will reduce the chances of exploitation. |

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
