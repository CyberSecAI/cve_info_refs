The provided content describes a vulnerability affecting multiple web vulnerability scanners, specifically N-Stealth and Nikto.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way these scanners process HTTP responses from scanned hosts. If a target host includes DHTML code within the "Server" field of its HTTP response headers, this code is executed by the browser when the scanner generates an HTML report.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability is a script injection issue, also known as cross-site scripting (XSS). It arises from the scanners' failure to properly sanitize or validate the content of the "Server" header before including it in the generated HTML report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary scripts into the scanner's HTML report. This code is executed within the "My Computer" security zone in Internet Explorer, potentially allowing an attacker to perform a range of malicious actions on the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious server manipulating the "Server" field of the HTTP response header. The attacker does not need any prior access to the scanner software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to control the target web server and be able to modify the HTTP response headers, specifically the "Server" field. The attacker would typically need administrative access to the webserver to make this change. The attack is triggered when a user scans the malicious server with a vulnerable version of the scanner and then views the resulting HTML report.
