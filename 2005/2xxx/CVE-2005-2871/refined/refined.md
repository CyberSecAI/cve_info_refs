Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-2871:

**CVE-2005-2871: Firefox 1.0.6 buffer overflow with hostname of all soft hyphens**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the way Mozilla products handle Internationalized Domain Names (IDN), specifically when encountering a hostname consisting entirely of soft-hyphen characters (U+00AD).  The `NormalizeIDN` function, when processing such a hostname, incorrectly returns a true value while setting `encHost` to an empty string. This leads to an incorrect calculation of buffer size during the construction of the URL, resulting in a buffer overflow when the long string of hyphens is appended to the undersized buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The core issue is a heap-based buffer overflow, meaning that the overflow occurs in memory allocated on the heap. This can lead to memory corruption and other unpredictable behavior.
*   **Incorrect IDN Handling:** The vulnerability arises due to an error in the IDN processing logic in `nsStandardURL::BuildNormalizedSpec`, specifically with how it handles soft hyphens and normalization.
*   **Insufficient Buffer Size Calculation:** The code fails to correctly calculate and allocate the appropriate buffer size for a URL when IDN normalization results in an empty string for the hostname component but the original hostname is long.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the user running the affected browser, by carefully crafting the overflow.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** If arbitrary code execution is not achieved, the overflow can still lead to a crash of the browser, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URLs:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that contains a hostname of all soft hyphens (or dashes in some cases).
*   **HTML Documents:** These malicious URLs can be embedded within HTML documents.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a website or opening an email that contains the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via network access.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use some form of social engineering to convince a user to click on the malicious link or visit a malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Publicly Available Exploit Code:** Exploit code for this vulnerability became publicly available soon after discovery.
*   **Workaround:** Disabling IDN support in affected browsers prevents exploitation.
*  **Affected Products**: The vulnerability affects various Mozilla products, including Firefox and the Mozilla Suite. Thunderbird is not affected because it does not process IDN hostnames.
* **Patches Available**: Patches were released for Firefox 1.0.7 and Mozilla Suite 1.7.12, which resolve this issue.
*  **CVE assignment**: The CVE ID CAN-2005-2871 was assigned to this issue.
*   **Secunia Advisory**: This issue is also tracked under Secunia advisory SA16764 and other Secunia advisories.
*   **Debian Security Advisory**: Debian issued DSA 837-1 and DSA 866-1 for this vulnerability.
*   **Gentoo Linux Security Advisory**: Gentoo issued GLSA 200509-11 for this vulnerability.
*   **HP-UX**: HP also released a security bulletin about the vulnerability (HPSBUX01231).
*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat issued updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
*   **Ubuntu**: Ubuntu issued USN-181-1 to address this vulnerability.
*   **Mozilla Advisory:** Mozilla released a security advisory (MFSA 2005-57) regarding the IDN heap overrun.
