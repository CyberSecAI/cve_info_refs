I am only making this important becuase after discussing it on
#debian-devel, the consensus was the this was annoying but not RC.  I am
CC'ing Nico and Elimar since this also applies to the unnofficial
mutt-ng pacakges.  mutt creates temporary files in a very predictable
and unsecure way.  There is no threat of overwriting an existing file or
creating a file somewhere where the user lacks appropriate permissions,
but there is a trivial way to DoS the users in mutt.

Steps to replicate:

Log into a shared machine and run 'ps aux|grep mutt'.  Choose a user
running mutt.  Note the pid of the mutt process you want to DOS.  Note
the username and run 'id <user>' to get the uid.  Then run 'for i in
`seq 0 1000` ; do touch /tmp/mutt-<hostname>-<uid>-<pid>-$i ; done' and
watch the user not be able to 1) compose mail, 2) change mailboxes, 3)
reply to mail, 4) or view help until mutt is restarted.  For added fun,
wrap in another for loop that iterates from 0 to 32767 and hit all the
PIDs and prevent the user from using mutt unil /tmp is cleaned or the
machine is rebooted.

Roberto,

This problem is a symptom of the larger "shared /tmp" issue.  A
solution is to use the TMPDIR environment variable as discussed
in the Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO.

    <http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/avoid-race.html#TEMPORARY-FILES>

Mutt honours the TMPDIR environment variable, so something like
the following in your ~/.bashrc (or equivalent) will avoid this
issue completely (and cover a few alternate variables).

    ## Safe, local temporary directory
    mkdir -p $HOME/tmp && for var in TMPDIR TMP TEMP TEMPDIR ; do export $var=$HOME/tmp; done
    test -d $TMPDIR || echo Warning: TMPDIR is not set correctly.

Yours sincerely,

That is fine.  However, given the existence of the tmpfile(3) function,
there is really no excuse for any program to employ a 1-up numbering of
temporary files.  Sepcifically, in the same section of the Secure-
Programs-HOWTO you cite:

   According to the 1997 ``Single Unix Specification'', the preferred
   method for creating an arbitrary temporary file (using the C interface)
   is tmpfile(3).

The paragraph after that goes on to talk about why mkstemp(3) is an even
better idea.  So, there are options.  Besides, given the choice between
the following two options:

1) One-time fix applied by upstream developer; by extenension, present
in all future releases.
2) Work around in ~/.bashrc (or equivalent) that must be applied to
every system accessed.  (Think a year or two down the road when you get
an account on a new machine).

I would say that that option 1 has major advantages:

1) Requires one person to do one thing to fix.
2) Less error prone/open to peer review.
3) Is not dependent on a specific user action.

Robert,

I agree Mutt should be fixed to create its temporary files in
non-predictable fashion.  That mutt honours TMPDIR provides a
work-around, not the solution for Mutt.

> Besides, given the choice between the following two options:
>

For this package only...

The flip-side of (2) is that the user avoids this class of problem for
many different packages, present and future.  Setting TMPDIR is a good
solution for the user - all software honouring this variable will nwo
avoid all the issues of the shared /tmp.

I like doing both - defence in depth, you know ;)

I largely agree with you; however, I felt that as TMPDIR is a solution
to the entire class of shared /tmp problems, it's worth mentioning.

OK.  I took what you initially said as you presenting TMPDIR as the
canonical solution.  That was my fault.

Not sure what this means.  If the fix is only applied to the Debian
package, then at least future releases of the Debian package.  If it is
applied upstream, then future upstream releases will have it as well.
Either way, a larger group of users benefits.

True.  Of course, the user must not fall into thinking that setting
TMPDIR is a silver bullet.  Of course, mutt honors the setting, but not
all programs do.

True.  It's all about layering.  Defense, security, keeping warm in
winter and onions.  There is a pattern there :-)

If only all programs obeyed it.  What would be really need would be if
we turned /tmp into a device node or something in proc.  Then the system
could redirect based on UID.  That is, you run foo as yourself and it
creates a temporary file under /tmp, and I also run foo and create a
temporary file under /tmp, but they are both in different places.  Just
an idea.

I fixed this bug for mutt-ng.
I attached a 64 bit hex string to the temporary file name.
In my opinion the TMPDIR solution is not very good.
Please CC me.

The user can still change $tmpdir in his muttrc to avoid this problem
(and also avoid losing data if the machine is rebooted). So, it would
be even more trivial by filling up the disk, but this would not be a
bug in Mutt.

IMHO, this is just a minor problem.

I have problems with reproducing this. I tried it with
mutt-ng but it seems that mutt-ng is simply overwriting this
files so mutt-ng is runiing well with it.
But anyway, the tmp file generation is not very good so I
will add an aditional more random string to the file name.
Regards Nico

Thanks.  Another possible solution is the use of the tmpfile(3) or
mkstemp(3) functions.  But yours appears sound as well.

Hi,
it seems like mutt doesn't initialize the rand like mutt-ng
does so this would be the right:

Date: Wed, 05 Apr 2006 15:55:23 +0200
```
Package: mutt
Version: 1.5.11+cvs20060330-1
Followup-For: Bug #311296

Hello,

While trying to debug another problem with galeon, I found that the
bug is still present when using this kind of entry in the .mailcap:

text/html; galeon -x -w %s; needsterminal; \
  test=ps ax|egrep -q "[0-9] *galeon";\
  nametemplate= %s.html

In this case, the temporary file is still mutt.html, and not
<something-random>.html. Commenting the "nametemplate" option, the name is
