{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by Hiki not properly escaping page names in certain contexts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of escaping page names when accessing missing pages.",
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of escaping page names in the 'Login' link.",
    "Configuration file loss due to unexpected queries during saving configuration."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into a page. This could allow them to steal session IDs of logged-in users, potentially leading to session hijacking. If an administrator's session ID is compromised, the attacker could manipulate system configurations, including changing passwords.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Accessing missing pages with a malicious page name.",
    "Clicking on a malicious 'Login' link with a crafted page name."
    
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs or content containing malicious script and have a victim user access the crafted content while being logged into the Hiki application. The attacker can be remote."
