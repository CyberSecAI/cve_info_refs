{
  "CVE-2005-2498": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the XML-RPC library where it allows the injection of arbitrary PHP code into eval() statements.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization within the XML-RPC library. This allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP code.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to a full compromise of the system and its data.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote and is typically done through crafted XML-RPC requests.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send XML-RPC requests to the vulnerable application. No specific prior access is required."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of a private copy of libpcre which is vulnerable to an integer overflow leading to a heap overflow and an XML-RPC library affected by a script injection vulnerability.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow in libpcre, leading to heap overflow and script injection vulnerability in XML-RPC library.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could target a PHP-based web application that would use untrusted data as regular expressions, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code. If web applications make use of the XML-RPC library shipped with PHP, they are also vulnerable to remote execution of arbitrary PHP code.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through crafted regular expressions and by exploiting XML-RPC library.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker could exploit this remotely via web applications using untrusted data in regular expressions or via XML-RPC requests."
