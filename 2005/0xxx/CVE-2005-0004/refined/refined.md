Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `mysqlaccess` script in MySQL creates temporary files in an insecure manner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure temporary file creation
- Vulnerability to symlink attacks

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local privilege escalation: An unprivileged user can overwrite arbitrary files with root privileges by exploiting the insecure temporary file creation via a symlink attack.
- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially reveal the contents of temporary files, which may contain sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The vulnerability can be exploited by a user on the same system where the vulnerable MySQL installation exists.
- Symlink attack: An attacker can create a symlink pointing to a target file, and when `mysqlaccess` creates a temporary file with the same name, it will overwrite the target file pointed by the symlink.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- No root privileges are required initially, as the goal is to escalate privileges.

**Additional details from content:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the `mysqlaccess` script.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pena from the Debian Security Audit Project.
- Patches for this issue were released for Debian (DSA 647-1) and Ubuntu (USN-63-1).
- The fix involves upgrading the `mysql` packages to the patched versions.
- The affected versions include MySQL 3.23.49, 4.0.23, and 4.1.8a, as well as Ubuntu's mysql-dfsg package version 4.0.20.
