Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2005-0423:

**Verification:**

The provided content from marc.info directly relates to a vulnerability in ASPjar guestbook software, specifically an SQL injection vulnerability in the login page and a delete function vulnerability. This aligns with CVE-2005-0423, which is described as an SQL injection vulnerability in ASPjar Guestbook's login script.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user input in the login page and a lack of authorization checks on the delete page. Specifically, the `login.asp` page is susceptible to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the password field. Additionally, the `delete.asp` page lacks proper authorization, enabling any user to delete messages.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The login script does not sanitize user-provided input before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially bypassing authentication.
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The delete function at `/admin/delete.asp` does not perform proper authorization, allowing any user to delete messages.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting the string `' or ''='` into the password field, an attacker can bypass the login authentication and gain administrative access to the guestbook.
    *  **Data Manipulation/Deletion:**  By accessing `/admin/delete.asp` attackers can delete messages.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Login Page Injection:** Sending a crafted request to the login page (`/admin/login.asp`) with malicious SQL code in the password field.
    *   **Direct Access to Delete Page:** Directly accessing the delete page (`/admin/delete.asp`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.

**Additional Information:**
The provided information from marc.info gives specific examples of how the vulnerability can be exploited and also reveals an additional issue where messages can be deleted without authentication on the `delete.asp` page.
