| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-12 13:16:07 UTC  ``` building a tbz2 of the webmin package contains the encrypted root password, as people often distribute these, probably a good idea to not include the `miniserv.users` file as part of the package.  You could comment out the part of setup.sh that creates the file and then create it yourself in pkg_postinst(), that way the file won't be part of the package.  (perhaps this bug affects usermin as well?)  A few quick google searches so at least a few people are distributing webmin tbz2's to the whole world! *ouch* :) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jeremy Huddleston (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-12 17:44:37 UTC  ``` how does miniserv.users get the root password?  The tbz2 is generated in src_install as user portage who can't even read /etc/shaddow  Am I missing something? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-13 04:00:46 UTC  ``` looks like it get's it from this line in the ebuild:  crypt=`grep "^root:" ${ROOT}/etc/shadow | cut -f 2 -d :`  perhaps you could just put some nonsense in there and then sed it out in pkg_postinst with the correct data? Although users who quickpkg it would still include the sensitive data..perhaps best to leave it out of the package altogether and create the file in pkg_postinst()?  src_install is run as root, i believe, otherwise it wouldnt be able to chown stuff...perhaps the userpriv feature changes that? I don't know it very well :) ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Jeremy Huddleston (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-13 05:20:23 UTC  ``` packages affected -> replacements =app-admin/webmin-1.170-r2 -> >=app-admin/webmin-1.170-r2  The affected package was removed since all the stable keywords were on my archs.  Not sure how you guys want to handle this as it's not wrong with installs but rather the binpkgs.  usermin isn't affected. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-13 09:30:01 UTC  ``` Thx everyone.  Both Koon and I vote for no GLSA on this one -> closing. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Jeremy Huddleston (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-13 15:01:13 UTC  ``` changing subject as usermin wasn't affected ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-06 12:20:01 UTC  ``` I do not think we need a GLSA for this. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-06 12:46:22 UTC  ``` regarding glsa, doesnt this qualify under the vulnerability treatment policy as "Global service compromise: denial of service, passwords or full database leaks", the webmin tbz2 would be world readable and these are often distributed by people to other users...these users need to know that their root password has been compromised (assuming the attacker knows how to use jtr).  Also, user action has to be taken to ensure security, ie actually removing the old tbz2..isnt that the point of security advisories? I found 2 users on the web who had these tbz2 accessible to the world, i let them know about this and advised them to change their pass :)  It's possible there are still packages with passwords in out there now (portage doesnt remove old ones!), I only spotted this as I was affected on a server i maintain, i know I would have liked to be informed that my root pass should be considered compromised?  according to gentoo-stats.org about 10% of systems have webmin installed. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-07 02:04:07 UTC  ``` reopening regarding glsa issue ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-07 02:17:02 UTC  ``` I tend to think now that Tavis is right, and we should issue a GLSA about it. I orginally thought it was quickpkg's fault (by design, it includes the files currently used on your filesystem), but here we had something in the ebuild that copied the root password over before the tbz2 was built (in the "buildpkg" feature or emerge -B), which is a clear ebuild flaw.  So I vote YES now :) ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Kurt Lieber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-08 13:15:54 UTC  ``` agree with koon.  think GLSA is needed. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-08 13:37:23 UTC  ``` I'll try to write the GLSA ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-11 13:08:21 UTC  ``` GLSA 200502-12 ``` |  |

# Webmin: Information leak in Gentoo binary package — GLSA **200502-12**

Portage-built Webmin binary packages accidentally include a file containing
the local encrypted root password.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/webmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.170-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.170-r3** |

### Background

Webmin is a web-based system administration console allowing an
administrator to easily configure servers and other features. Using the
'buildpkg' FEATURE, or the -b/-B emerge options, Portage can build
reusable binary packages for any of the packages available through the
Portage tree.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered that
the Webmin ebuild contains a design flaw. It imports the encrypted
local root password into the miniserv.users file before building binary
packages that include this file.

### Impact

A remote attacker could retrieve Portage-built Webmin binary packages
and recover the encrypted root password from the build host.

### Workaround

Users who never built or shared a Webmin binary package are unaffected
by this.

### Resolution

Webmin users should delete any old shared Webmin binary package as soon
as possible. They should also consider their buildhost root password
potentially exposed and follow proper audit procedures.

If you plan to build binary packages, you should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/webmin-1.170-r3"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Andrew J Forgue    2002-01-07 21:29:13 UTC  ``` Doing A fresh merge of GnuCash installed   Guile, slib2d2, swig with no errors.    When Running GNUCash it generates this error:  ------------  bash-2.04$ gnucash  It appears you do not have the 'slib' scheme library installed. You need slib2c4 or later to run GnuCash.  Obtain slib at: <http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html>  If you have slib installed, you may need to create a symbolic link named 'slib' from the guile directory (usually /usr/share/guile) to the directory where slib is installed.  You may also need to run GnuCash once as root.   Some deprecated features have been used.  Set the environment variable GUILE_WARN_DEPRECATED to "detailed" and rerun the program to get more information.  Set it to "no" to suppress this message. bash-2.04$  -----------  As root it gives the same result.   Slib IS Installed:  bash-2.04$ ls /var/db/pkg/dev-libs/ expat-1.95.1-r1  libole2-0.2.4      libxml-1.8.16      pilot-link-0.9.6-r3 g-wrap-1.3.1     libpcre-3.7        libxml2-2.4.12     popt-1.5 glib-1.2.10-r1   librep-0.14        libxslt-1.0.9      rep-gtk-0.15-r2 gmp-3.1.1-r1     libunicode-0.4-r1  openssl-0.9.6b-r1  !!slib-2.4.2!! bash-2.04$   ---------------------------  This appears to be a merge issue, or at worst a version conflict between gnucash and something else.  After merge/unmerge of all gnucash dependencies - this error still persists. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-08 17:24:15 UTC  ``` these kind of errors should go to the component which the program fits into. The ebuild-component is for submitting ebuilds. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  protrans    2002-01-10 00:01:54 UTC  ``` I had different error msgs with gnucash: after emerging gnucash-1.6.5-r1.ebuild successfully, I had the following on star tup of gnucash:  ERROR: In procedure dynamic-link: ERROR: file: "libgw-runtime", message: "file not found"  Some deprecated features have been used.  Set the environment variable GUILE_WARN_DEPRECATED to "detailed" and rerun the program to get more information.  Set it to "no" to suppress this message.  After setting the above variable, I got:  `scm_sysintern' is deprecated. Use `scm_define' instead. ERROR: In procedure dynamic-link: ERROR: file: "libgw-runtime", message: "file not found"  Hope that helps,  Joseph H. Yao  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Martin Bergstrand    2002-01-29 15:38:38 UTC  ``` I got both problems above. After merging gnuchash it complained about the missing libgw. I remergerd g-wrap and got the missing slib message. Tried to remerge slib but to no avail. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Carl Perry (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-03 00:26:48 UTC  ``` the slib ebuild is not installing "guile.init" - which is needed to complete the slib installation.  I installed this manually, and ran the supplied command in slib's README - same error starting gnucash.  I think the guile.init should be added to the ebuild script.  It doesn't _seem_ to fix anything, but the fact that is not there could be a problem. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  George Shapovalov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-09 13:58:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been resolved lately, as far as I can tell (and I have gnucash running now fine). This is a (common) case of "too new" dependency: g-wrap requires guile-1.4, NOT 1.5.x to build correctly.  Another small thing not reported so widely is that guppy ebuild contains dependency on guile-1.5, while it will build fine with guile-1.4. Therefore the followinf changes to 2 ebuild files will provide the most clean fix of this problem for now (until gnucash people update g-wrap modules to use recent guile)  in dev-libs/g-wrap/g-wrap-1.3.1.ebuild:      ">=dev-util/guile-1.4"  ->  "=dev-util/guile-1.4" in gnome-extra/guppi/guppi-0.40.3.ebuild:      ">=dev-util/guile-1.5"  ->  ">=dev-util/guile-1.4" should take care of the problem.  Another suggestion was to emerge both versions of guile, however here you must be very careful about the order in which you emerge things. Therefore, unless you need guile-1.5 for something else, the former seems to be cleaner solution for now. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Carl Perry (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-10 15:21:23 UTC  ``` Even with those changes, emerge still tries to merge guile-1.5, and complains that guild-1.4 is not found.  I had to make the following changes:  in dev-libs/g-wrap/g-wrap-1.3.1.ebuild: "=dev-util/guile-1.4-r3" in gnome-extra/guppi/guppi-0.40.3.ebuild: "=dev-util/guile-1.4-r3"  The dependancies were then satisfied.  However, starting gnucash now states: ERROR: In procedure dynamic-link: ERROR: file not found  All dynamic libs (found via ldd) were found. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  David Mott    2002-02-27 11:02:20 UTC  ``` I resolved this issue tonight and thought I would add some comments. (Finally)  1. g-wrap follows linux kernel numbering scheme so that if 2nd digit is  odd=unstable, even=stable. Therefore I reverted back to g-wrap-1.2.1 (simply  by renaming the 1.3.1 ebuild!)  2. Followed Carl's instructions to modify the g-wrap(1.2.1) and guppi ebuild  to use guile-1.4-r3  3. After merging gnucash I remerged g-wrap(1.2.1) and that fixed my problems.  ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Carl Perry (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-27 17:17:48 UTC  ``` It may have worked for David, but it didn't work for me :(  I'm back to the "It appears you do not have the 'slib' scheme library installed." error. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Carl Perry (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-27 17:24:02 UTC  ``` Scratch that, it just needed to be run once as root.  Like it says.  Duh.  I also discovered that you cannot unmerge g-wrap 1.3.1 first, as you get an error.  This could be due to some other library depending on g-wrap 1.3.1, but I'm unsure.  Is there some easy way to "rebuild everything that gnucash depends on"?  Also, I have a patch available if someone wants it for CVS. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  George Shapovalov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-15 13:41:43 UTC  ``` Hi Carl,  Its been a while since you posted your comment, but this issue has not come up again until now. If you still have the patch I think you should attach it to this bug, so that people can just grab it from here even if it does not get incorporated into the portage tree. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Jon Nelson (RETIRED)    2002-03-16 00:39:39 UTC  ``` Well, I built it successfully tonight. The only change I have that is different from "stock", is that I built guile 1.4something and installed that.  guppi complains about wanting guile 1.5, but the guppi docs say that guile 1.3 or better is needed, not 1.5  Anyway, *all I did* was emerge guile 1.4, and then rebuild gnucash. After that, all was good.  (Oh, I masked guile >= 1.5 in my /etc/make.profile/packages file) I know, guppi complains. SO what.  ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-19 14:56:07 UTC  ``` Unmerge guile,g-wrap,slib,guppi,gnucash and maybe swig, and remerge gnucash, then it should work now .. at least, it did here. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Jeff Simon    2002-03-29 19:40:43 UTC  ``` I am getting similar errors. Mine is this:  ERROR: no such module (g-wrapped gw-runtime)  I've rsynced and remerged and nothing seems to get it to work. It would help if I know which program was giving the error. I'm pretty sure it's not Gnucash.  ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  set\_48035    2002-03-31 16:55:44 UTC  ```      I also just merged gnucash, and had the problem: ERROR: no such module (g-wrapped gw-runtime)      When invoking gnucash, but it went away after I remerged g-wrap.  Paul set_48035@yahoo.com ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Jon Nelson (RETIRED)    2002-03-31 21:55:35 UTC  ``` Same here (with 1.0 as of 31 March 2002). Emerged gnucash. No happy. rm /usr/portage/packages/All/g-wrap* emerge --buildpkg g-wrap  gnucash works.  ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-01 14:37:48 UTC  ``` Anybody with problems please remerge g-wrap.  It had the libtool "relink" bug, which should be fixed in g-wrap-1.2.1-r1. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 15:47:25 UTC  ``` This is still working for me (new build, fresh merge).  Any comments ? ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-05-27 17:33:15 UTC  ``` This seems to be still working, resolving. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-06-24 18:36:14 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 4053](show_bug.cgi?id=4053 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - gnucash-1.6.6 doesn't run with guile 1.5.4: linking problem.") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` |  |
