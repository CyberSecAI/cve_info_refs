```
```
Package: cdrtools
Version: 4:2.01+01a01-2
Priority: minor
Tags: security patch

Cdrtools has some code (and default configuration) that suggests users that
want to debug its behaviour to open up a can of worms associate to insecure
temporary files usage. The Debug file defined in the configuration will
just be fopened() without any checks and is thus vulnerable to symlink
attacks.

The attached patch tries to fix this minor bug (not many users will really
enabled DEBUG) by introducing a check in rscsi.c to avoid being vulnerable
to symlink attacks and by modifying the provided config file telling users
to use safe locations for debug files. The patch introduces a DoS condition
(if somebody has created the file the program will exit) and that's why
users are suggested (in the comments of the configuration file) to use a
safe location (not /tmp) for debugging.

Regards

Javier

1) You do not acknowledge CAN-2005-0866 as Joey requested in the bug report
2) Ubuntu's patch is, I believe, based on my patch, you could at least
granted me some credit for the patch in the changelog...

I'm surprised that a security bug (with patch) provided in January takes
four months to fix. Oh well, this was not a critical issue either, but
the fix was immediate...

You see, all of that has a common reason - lack of time. Do you wish to
be credited in the next changelog? Something like the following?

 * WE THANK JFS FOR PROVIDING A PATCH FIXING #291376. GET IT, BASTARDS!!!1

And nobody did hinder you on sending a reminder about the outstanding
problem. An (announced) NMU in this case would have been appropriate.

Regards,
Eduard.

I estimate the time of you writing that witty mail similar to the one of
applying the patch I produced, build the package and upload it. The only
difference is that it took you ~2 hours to write that mail vs. the four
months for the patch.

Thanks for publicly encouraging others to help you out.

2 hours? Do you really think that it has taken 2 hours to write the few
lines? No, it was the time needed to react (as in: get spare time + mind
context switching).

A-Ha. Germans call a such thing "etwas in den falschen Hals kriegen",
translated by dict.leo.org to "to get hold of the wrong end of the
stick". Please try reading my message without interpretting offense into
it.

Eduard.
