How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## TCP does not adequately validate segments before updating timestamp value

#### Vulnerability Note VU#637934

Original Release Date: 2005-05-18 | Last Revised: 2005-08-23

---

### Overview

Certain TCP implementations may allow a remote attacker to arbitrarily modify host timestamp values, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is defined in [RFC 793](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt) as a means to provide reliable host-to-host transmission between hosts in a packet-switched computer networks. [RFC 1323](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt) introduced techniques to increase the performance of TCP. Two such techniques are TCP timestamps and Protection Against Wrapped Sequence Numbers (PAWS).  In certain implementations of TCP with timestamps enabled, both hosts maintain an internal timer that is used to detect segment loss and regulate traffic flow. PAWS uses timestamps to prevent duplicate or old segments from corrupting an active connection. In PAWS with the timestamps option enabled, hosts use an internal timer to track the value of the timestamp in incoming segments against the last valid timestamp recorded. If the segment's timestamp is larger than the value of the last valid timestamp and the sequence number is less than the last acknowledgement sent, then the host's internal timer is updated with the new timestamp value and the segment is passed on for further processing. Otherwise, the segment is rejected as too old or a duplicate. If a remote attacker can determine the source and destination ports as well as IP addresses of both hosts engaged in an active connection, that attacker may be able to inject a specially crafted segment into the connection. When the spoofed segment is received the host's internal timer value will be changed to the value in the crafted segment. Please note that, in certain TCP implementations, sequence numbers are not properly validated before the internal timer is updated, soan attacker does not need to know a correct sequence number to change the internal timer. If the internal timer value is set to a large value, then it will likely be larger than the timestamp value in subsequent incoming segments. This will cause new, legitimate TCP segments to be evaluated as too old and discarded. As segments are rejected, the flow of data between hosts stops, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. For more information about TCP, timestamps, and PAWS please see [RFC 793](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt) and [RFC 1323](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause TCP connections to abort/drop segments, leading to a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch** Users who suspect they are vulnerable are encouraged to check with their vendor to determine the appropriate action to take. Please see the list of vendors we have notified below. |
| --- |

| **Disable PAWS**  As a workaround, disable PAWS and TCP timestamps if they are not needed. |

### [Redback Networks Inc.](#JGEI-6ABPPC) Affected

Notified:  March 09, 2005  Updated: May 19, 2005

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Impact of CERT® Advisory VU#637934 on Redback Products

**Vulnerability Description:** Systems with persistent TCP connections might be affected by this vulnerability.

The TCP Timestamps option (RFC1323) is deployed widely. There is a variant of the TCP Timestamps option, which would supposedly be more prevalent than the standard algorithm. The variant, however, has a vulnerability which allows malicious, off-path third parties to stall TCP connections.

More details on this vulnerability can be found at the CERT website. (www.cert.org)

**Impacted Redback Products:** NONE ofRedback SmartEdge 400, 800 Routers; Redback SmartEdge 400, 800 Service Gateway Systems are impacted by this issue.
NONE of the products of SMS product-line are affected by this issue

**Why Redback products are not affected:**
The TCP/IP stack on both of Redback product-lines already implements all validation procedures outlined in the CERT advisory before a packet is accepted and the session timestamp updated. Consequently, TCP applications on Redback products are not vulnerable to this attack.

**Recommended Best Practice to Guard Against TCP Attacks:** While there is no way a network operator can completely defend against various vulnerabilities and hacker attacks, Redback Networks products already implement many mechanisms to guard against such attacks. Some examples include:
·MD5 authentication for TCP

·IP source address validation on any subscriber circuit, so no subscriber terminated on the box can participate in this type of attack.

**Vulnerability Resolution: NOT Required on this since Redback product-lines are not affected.**

For further assistance or information regarding this topic contact the Redback Networks Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC is prepared to provide worldwide support for security workarounds that address this issue. There are several known workarounds that can significantly reduce this exposure. The Redback domestic TAC number is (877) 733 2225 and International TAC phone number is 31-104987777. Redback TAC will provide detailed information to our worldwide systems engineers and focal engineers to assist customers in configuring these workarounds.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

TCP Denial of Service Vulnerability(SCOSA-2005.64)

Original Release Date: January 30, 2006

Last Revised: February 7, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-032

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

SCO has issued a security advisory regarding a UnixWare with TCP
timestamps
running Protection Against Wrapped Sequence Numbers (PAWS).

A vulnerability has been found in TCP timestamps with PAWS which
could allow
an attacker to propagate a potential denial-of-service against an
affected
system. Previously, this issue was thought to affect Avaya products,
upon
further investigation, it was found that this issue does not affect
Avaya
products shipping on UnixWare. No Avaya systems products ship with SCO
TCP with
timestamps using PAWS configured, and are therefore not vulnerable.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2005-0356](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0356) to this issue.

## 2. Avaya System Products running SCO TCP timestamps with PAWS:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intuity Audix | All | None | The installed version of TCP does not have timestamps with PAWS configured. |

## 3. Additional Information:

This issue has previously been reported by Avaya for other OS
platforms in
ASA-2005-148, which can be viewed at:

* <http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/ASA-2005-148.pdf>

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.
