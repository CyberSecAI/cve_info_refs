Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2005-0356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how certain TCP implementations handle timestamps when the Protection Against Wrapped Sequence Numbers (PAWS) mechanism is enabled. Specifically, some implementations do not adequately validate sequence numbers in incoming TCP segments before updating their internal timer with the timestamp value from the segment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Sequence Number Validation:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly validate the sequence number of incoming TCP segments before using the timestamp for PAWS. This allows an attacker to inject a crafted TCP segment with an arbitrary timestamp.
*   **Reliance on Timestamp for PAWS:** The vulnerability is present in TCP implementations that rely on timestamps for PAWS without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition. By injecting a TCP segment with a large timestamp value, the attacker can cause the victim's system to update its internal timer. Subsequent legitimate TCP segments from the peer will then be considered "too old" due to having a smaller timestamp than the attacker-provided value. This leads to the dropping of legitimate segments and effectively disrupts the TCP connection.
*   **Connection Abortion:** The dropping of packets due to the modified timestamp will lead to TCP connections aborting/dropping packets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Spoofed TCP Segments:** The attack vector involves injecting a specially crafted TCP segment into an active connection.
*   **Off-Path Attack:** The attacker does not need to be "on-path," meaning they don't need to be in the direct communication path between the two target hosts.
*   **Network Injection:** The attacker needs to inject crafted packets into the network that the target hosts use for communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Source and Destination:** The attacker needs to know the source and destination IP addresses and TCP ports of the target hosts.
*   **Ability to Inject Packets:** The attacker must have the ability to inject packets into the network.
*  **No need for correct sequence number**: Attackers do not need to guess or know the correct sequence number to successfully carry out the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability primarily affects TCP implementations that use timestamps for PAWS.
*   Disabling TCP timestamps and PAWS is mentioned as a potential workaround.
*   The vulnerability was originally reported by Noritoshi Demizu
*   Multiple vendors were notified, including Microsoft, Blue Coat Systems, Cisco, FreeBSD, and others. Some vendors were found to not be vulnerable.
