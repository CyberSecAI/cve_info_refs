## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

RHSA-2005:070 - Security Advisory

# RHSA-2005:070 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

ImageMagick security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Updated ImageMagick packages that fix a heap based buffer overflow are now
available.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

ImageMagick is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
System.

Andrei Nigmatulin discovered a heap based buffer overflow flaw in the
ImageMagick image handler. An attacker could create a carefully crafted
Photoshop Document (PSD) image in such a way that it would cause
ImageMagick to execute arbitrary code when processing the image. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2005-0005 to this issue.

A format string bug was found in the way ImageMagick handles filenames. An
attacker could execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine if they were
able to trick the victim into opening a file with a specially crafted name.
 The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2005-0397 to this issue.

A bug was found in the way ImageMagick handles TIFF tags. It is possible
that a TIFF image file with an invalid tag could cause ImageMagick to
crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2005-0759 to this issue.

A bug was found in ImageMagick's TIFF decoder. It is possible that a
specially crafted TIFF image file could cause ImageMagick to crash. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name CAN-2005-0760 to this issue.

A bug was found in the way ImageMagick parses PSD files. It is possible
that a specially crafted PSD file could cause ImageMagick to crash. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name CAN-2005-0761 to this issue.

A heap overflow bug was found in ImageMagick's SGI parser. It is possible
that an attacker could execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into
opening a specially crafted SGI image file. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0762 to
this issue.

Users of ImageMagick should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches, and are not vulnerable to these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied. Use Red Hat
Network to download and update your packages. To launch the Red Hat
Update Agent, use the following command:

up2date

CVE IDs        : CAN-2005-0397 CAN-2005-0759 CAN-2005-0760 CAN-2005-0762
BugTraq ID     : 12875
Debian Bug     : 297990

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in ImageMagick, a
commonly used image manipulation library.  These problems can be
exploited by a carefully crafted graphic image.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CAN-2005-0397

    Tavis Ormandy discovered a format string vulnerability in the
    filename handling code which allows a remote attacker to cause a
    denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.

CAN-2005-0759

    Andrei Nigmatulin discovered a denial of service condition which
    can be caused by an invalid tag in a TIFF image.

CAN-2005-0760

    Andrei Nigmatulin discovered that the TIFF decoder is vulnerable
    to accessing memory out of bounds which will result in a
    segmentation fault.

CAN-2005-0762

    Andrei Nigmatulin discovered a buffer overflow in the SGI parser
    which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a
    specially crafted SGI image file.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4.5-1woody6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 6.0.6.2-2.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
