{
  "cve": "CVE-2005-0758",
  "description": "The zgrep utility improperly sanitizes arguments, which may come from an untrusted source, leading to arbitrary command execution.",
  "affected_packages": [
    "app-arch/gzip"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The zgrep utility in gzip improperly sanitizes arguments that could come from untrusted sources.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Improper sanitization of arguments in zgrep"
  ],
  "impact": "Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user running zgrep.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Specially crafted file names containing shell metacharacters"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create files with malicious names in a directory where a user may run zgrep.",
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from how zgrep uses `sed` to manipulate filenames. Filenames containing special characters, such as '|', '&', ';', and newlines, are not properly escaped, allowing the injection of arbitrary shell commands. This can be exploited if a user runs `zgrep` on files in an untrusted location where the attacker can create files with such malicious filenames."
