- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `nwprint` binary. The program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing a long input string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in the `nwprint` binary when provided with an overly long string as an argument.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the effective group ID (egid) of `lp`. Although not root, the attacker gains elevated privileges by using the `lp` group privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by passing an overly long string as a command-line argument to the `nwprint` binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute `nwprint`.
