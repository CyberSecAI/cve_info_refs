Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2004-1017

    Multiple overflows exist in the io_edgeport driver which might be usable
    as a denial of service attack vector.

CVE-2005-0124

    Bryan Fulton reported a bounds checking bug in the coda_pioctl function
    which may allow local users to execute arbitrary code or trigger a denial
    of service attack.

CVE-2005-0449

    An error in the skb_checksum_help() function from the netfilter framework
    has been discovered that allows the bypass of packet filter rules or
    a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2457

    Tim Yamin discovered that insufficient input validation in the zisofs driver
    for compressed ISO file systems allows a denial of service attack through
    maliciously crafted ISO images.

CVE-2005-2490

    A buffer overflow in the sendmsg() function allows local users to execute
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2005-2555

    Herbert Xu discovered that the setsockopt() function was not restricted to
    users/processes with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. This allows attackers to
    manipulate IPSEC policies or initiate a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2709

    Al Viro discovered a race condition in the /proc handling of network devices.
    A (local) attacker could exploit the stale reference after interface shutdown
    to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code in kernel mode.

CVE-2005-2800

    Jan Blunck discovered that repeated failed reads of /proc/scsi/sg/devices
    leak memory, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-2973

    Tetsuo Handa discovered that the udp_v6_get_port() function from the IPv6 code
    can be forced into an endless loop, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3044

    Vasiliy Averin discovered that the reference counters from sockfd_put() and
    fput() can be forced into overlapping, which allows a denial of service attack
    through a null pointer dereference.

CVE-2005-3053

    Eric Dumazet discovered that the set_mempolicy() system call accepts a negative
    value for it's first argument, which triggers a BUG() assert. This allows a
    denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3055

    Harald Welte discovered that if a process issues a USB Request Block (URB)
    to a device and terminates before the URB completes, a stale pointer
    would be dereferenced.  This could be used to trigger a denial of service
    attack.

CVE-2005-3180

    Pavel Roskin discovered that the driver for Orinoco wireless cards clears
    it's buffers insufficiently. This could leak sensitive information into
    user space.

CVE-2005-3181

    Robert Derr discovered that the audit subsystem uses an incorrect function to
    free memory, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3257

    Rudolf Polzer discovered that the kernel improperly restricts access to the
    KDSKBSENT ioctl, which can possibly lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2005-3356

    Doug Chapman discovered that the mq_open syscall can be tricked into
    decrementing an internal counter twice, which allows a denial of service attack
    through a kernel panic.

CVE-2005-3358

    Doug Chapman discovered that passing a 0 zero bitmask to the set_mempolicy()
    system call leads to a kernel panic, which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3783

    The ptrace code using CLONE_THREAD didn't use the thread group ID to
    determine whether the caller is attaching to itself, which allows a denial
    of service attack.

CVE-2005-3784

    The auto-reaping of childe processes functionality included ptraced-attached
    processes, which allows denial of service through dangling references.

CVE-2005-3806

    Yen Zheng discovered that the IPv6 flow label code modified an incorrect variable,
    which could lead to memory corruption and denial of service.

CVE-2005-3847

    It was discovered that a threaded real-time process, which is currently dumping
    core can be forced into a dead-lock situation by sending it a SIGKILL signal,
    which allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2005-3848

    Ollie Wild discovered a memory leak in the icmp_push_reply() function, which
    allows denial of service through memory consumption.

CVE-2005-3857

    Chris Wright discovered that excessive allocation of broken file lock leases
    in the VFS layer can exhaust memory and fill up the system logging, which allows
    denial of service.

CVE-2005-3858

    Patrick McHardy discovered a memory leak in the ip6_input_finish() function from
    the IPv6 code, which allows denial of service.

CVE-2005-4605

    Karl Janmar discovered that a signedness error in the procfs code can be exploited
    to read kernel memory, which may disclose sensitive information.

CVE-2005-4618

    Yi Ying discovered that sysctl does not properly enforce the size of a buffer, which
    allows a denial of service attack.

CVE-2006-0095

    Stefan Rompf discovered that dm_crypt does not clear an internal struct before freeing
    it, which might disclose sensitive information.

CVE-2006-0096

    It was discovered that the SDLA driver's capability checks were too lax
    for firmware upgrades.

CVE-2006-0482

    Ludovic Courtes discovered that get_compat_timespec() performs insufficient input
    sanitizing, which allows a local denial of service attack.

CVE-2006-1066

    It was discovered that ptrace() on the ia64 architecture allows a local denial of
    service attack, when preemption is enabled.

The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     Source                      2.6.8-16sarge2
     Alpha architecture          2.6.8-16sarge2
     AMD64 architecture          2.6.8-16sarge2
     HP Precision architecture   2.6.8-6sarge2

     IBM S/390 architecture      2.6.8-5sarge2
     Sun Sparc architecture      2.6.8-15sarge2

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatability with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     kernel-latest-2.6-alpha     101sarge1
     kernel-latest-2.6-amd64     103sarge1
     kernel-latest-2.6-hppa      2.6.8-1sarge1
     kernel-latest-2.6-sparc     101sarge1
     kernel-latest-2.6-i386      101sarge1
     kernel-latest-powerpc       102sarge1
     fai-kernels                 1.9.1sarge1
     hostap-modules-i386         0.3.7-1sarge1
     mol-modules-2.6.8           0.9.70+2.6.8+12sarge1
     ndiswrapper-modules-i386    1.1-2sarge1

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

This update introduces a change in the kernel's binary interface, the affected
kernel packages inside Debian have been rebuilt, if you're running local addons
you'll need to rebuild these as well.

# SecLists.Org Security Mailing List Archive

Any hacker will tell you that the latest news and exploits are not
found on any web site—not even [Insecure.Org](https://insecure.org). No, the cutting edge
in security research is and will continue to be the full
disclosure mailing lists such as Bugtraq. Here we provide web
archives and RSS feeds (now including message extracts), updated in real-time, for many of our favorite lists.
Browse the individual lists below, or search them all using the Site Search box above.

**[Full Disclosure](/fulldisclosure/)** — A public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. The relaxed atmosphere of this quirky list provides some comic relief and certain industry gossip. More importantly, fresh vulnerabilities sometimes hit this list many hours or days before they pass through the Bugtraq moderation queue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Any hacker will tell you that the latest news and exploits are not
found on any web site—not even [Insecure.Org](https://insecure.org). No, the cutting edge
in security research is and will continue to be the full
disclosure mailing lists such as Bugtraq. Here we provide web
archives and RSS feeds (now including message extracts), updated in real-time, for many of our favorite lists.

**[Full Disclosure](/fulldisclosure/)** — A public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. The relaxed atmosphere of this quirky list provides some comic relief and certain industry gossip. More importantly, fresh vulnerabilities sometimes hit this list many hours or days before they pass through the Bugtraq moderation queue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**[Full Disclosure](/fulldisclosure/)** — A public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. The relaxed atmosphere of this quirky list provides some comic relief and certain industry gossip. More importantly, fresh vulnerabilities sometimes hit this list many hours or days before they pass through the Bugtraq moderation queue.

**[Daily Dave](/dailydave/)** — This technical discussion list covers vulnerability research, exploit development, and security events/gossip. It was started by [ImmunitySec](http://www.immunitysec.com/) founder Dave Aitel and many security luminaries participate. Many posts simply advertise Immunity products, but you can't really fault Dave for being self-promotional on a list named DailyDave.

# SecLists.Org Security Mailing List Archive

Any hacker will tell you that the latest news and exploits are not
found on any web site—not even [Insecure.Org](https://insecure.org). No, the cutting edge
in security research is and will continue to be the full
disclosure mailing lists such as Bugtraq. Here we provide web
archives and RSS feeds (now including message extracts), updated in real-time, for many of our favorite lists.
Browse the individual lists below, or search them all using the Site Search box above.

[![fulldisclosure logo](/images/fulldisclosure-logo.png)](/fulldisclosure/)

**[Full Disclosure](/fulldisclosure/)** — A public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. The relaxed atmosphere of this quirky list provides some comic relief and certain industry gossip. More importantly, fresh vulnerabilities sometimes hit this list many hours or days before they pass through the Bugtraq moderation queue.
