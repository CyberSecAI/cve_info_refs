# Cyrus IMAP Server: Multiple overflow vulnerabilities — GLSA **200502-29**

The Cyrus IMAP Server is affected by several overflow vulnerabilities which
could potentially lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/cyrus-imapd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.12** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.12** |

### Background

The Cyrus IMAP Server is an efficient, highly-scalable IMAP e-mail
server.

### Description

Possible single byte overflows have been found in the imapd annotate
extension and mailbox handling code. Furthermore stack buffer overflows
have been found in fetchnews, the backend and imapd.

### Impact

An attacker, who could be an authenticated user or an admin of a
peering news server, could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the Cyrus IMAP
Server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Cyrus IMAP Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/cyrus-imapd-2.2.12"
```

===========================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-87-1		  February 28, 2005
cyrus21-imapd vulnerability
CAN-2005-0546
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)

The following packages are affected:

cyrus21-imapd

The problem can be corrected by upgrading the affected package to
version 2.1.16-6ubuntu0.3.  In general, a standard system upgrade is
sufficient to effect the necessary changes.

Details follow:

Sean Larsson discovered a buffer overflow in the IMAP "annotate"
extension. This possibly allowed an authenticated IMAP client to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Cyrus IMAP server.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
