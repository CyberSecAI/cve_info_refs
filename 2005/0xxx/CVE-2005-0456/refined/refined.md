Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-0456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Opera web browser fails to properly validate data encoded using the `data:` URI scheme (RFC 2397). Specifically, when a `data:` URI contains base64 encoded binary data, Opera does not handle it correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** Opera does not validate the content of the binary data within the `data:` URI. It directly executes the binary data if it's executable, without proper checks.
- **Lack of Content-Type Handling:** Opera doesn't enforce or validate the declared content-type specified in the URI before handling and potentially executing the content.
- **Bypass Security Software:** Security software (like antivirus) might not detect malicious content encoded in this manner because they don't typically scan within `data:` URIs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious `data:` URI containing executable code. If a user opens this URI in Opera, the code will be directly executed. This allows the attacker to take control of the user's system.
- **Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly mentioned as primary impact, the arbitrary code execution could also lead to information disclosure by accessing sensitive user data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted Web Pages:** An attacker can host a web page with a malicious `data:` URI embedded within it. When a user visits the page with a vulnerable version of Opera, the code executes.
- **HTML Emails:** The attacker can send an HTML email containing the malicious `data:` URI. When the user views the email in a vulnerable Opera browser, the code executes.
- **Other Means:**  Any medium where a user can click a link, such as instant messages, web forums, or IRC channels, could be used to deliver a malicious `data:` URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the target system. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the internet or through email.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the victim to click on a malicious link or open a crafted email, a form of social engineering.
- **Craft Malicious `data:` URI:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a base64 encoded binary executable and embed this inside a `data:` URI.
