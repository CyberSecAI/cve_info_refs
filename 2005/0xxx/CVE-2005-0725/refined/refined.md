- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `getAllbyArticle` function in `class/wfsfiles.php` directly incorporates the `$articleid` parameter into an SQL query without any sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In a broader context, it could compromise the entire application and the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the `articleid` parameter in the URL, for example: `http://[path]/[folder[/article.php?articleid=1[SQL Code[like OR 1=1]]`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to access the vulnerable web page and manipulate URL parameters.
