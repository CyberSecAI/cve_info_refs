The provided content is a webpage from waraxe.us, and it contains a security advisory: "[waraxe-2005-SA#040] - Full path disclosure and XSS in PhpNuke 6.x-7.6".

Based on this information, the following can be extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
- The advisory indicates the presence of "Full path disclosure" and "XSS" vulnerabilities in PhpNuke versions 6.x to 7.6.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- **Full Path Disclosure:** This vulnerability reveals the server's file system path, which could aid attackers in further exploitation.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation**:
- Full path disclosure can help attackers map the file structure of the server.
- XSS can enable attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface web pages.

**Attack vectors**:
- The specific attack vectors are not detailed in the provided content. The full path disclosure would likely occur due to inadequate error handling or a similar issue. XSS vulnerabilities would be exploitable via the injection of malicious code within user-controlled parameters or content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- For the full path disclosure, an attacker needs to trigger the vulnerability by manipulating specific parameters to expose the path.
- For XSS, the attacker would need to find an input point that does not sanitize user inputs and inject their malicious code.
