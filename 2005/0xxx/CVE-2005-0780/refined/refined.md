- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application directly accesses PHP scripts without proper input validation or access control, leading to PHP errors that reveal the full server path in error messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Full Path Disclosure. The scripts output error messages containing the full server path when accessed directly with specific parameters, or when required functions are not available.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, which could be used to discover other vulnerabilities, sensitive data, or launch further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Direct HTTP requests to various PHP scripts within the paFileDB application with specific parameters, bypassing intended access routes or missing required parameters, triggering PHP error messages that disclose the full path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application and knowledge of the vulnerable scripts and parameter combinations to trigger the errors. No authentication or special privileges are required.
