  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An unchecked buffer in Microsoft Word.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow",

If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users with fewer privileges would be at less risk.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially-crafted document containing malicious code and then sending this document to a user, typically through an email message. The attacker could also host the document on a network share or a website.",
