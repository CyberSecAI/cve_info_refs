# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-28

## Unsafe /tmp/plugtmp directory exploitable to erase user's files

Announced
February 24, 2005
Reporter
Tavis Ormandy
Risk
High (on shared machine, low otherwise)
Impact
Critical (local)
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.1
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.6

### Description

A predictable name is used for the plugin temporary directory. A malicious
local user could symlink this to the victim's home directory and wait for
the victim to run Firefox. When Firefox shuts down the victim's directory
would be erased.

### Workaround

None.

# Mozilla Firefox: Various vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-10**

Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to a local file deletion issue and to various
issues allowing to trick the user into trusting fake web sites or
interacting with privileged content.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is the popular next-generation browser from the
Mozilla project.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla
Firefox:

* Michael Krax reported that plugins can be used
  to load privileged content and trick the user to interact with it
  (CAN-2005-0232, CAN-2005-0527)
* Michael Krax also reported
  potential spoofing or cross-site-scripting issues through overlapping
  windows, image drag-and-drop, and by dropping javascript: links on tabs
  (CAN-2005-0230, CAN-2005-0231, CAN-2005-0591)
* Daniel de Wildt
  and Gael Delalleau discovered a memory overwrite in a string library
  (CAN-2005-0255)
* Wind Li discovered a possible heap overflow in
  UTF8 to Unicode conversion (CAN-2005-0592)
* Eric Johanson
  reported that Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) features allow
  homograph attacks (CAN-2005-0233)
* Mook, Doug Turner, Kohei
  Yoshino and M. Deaudelin reported various ways of spoofing the SSL
  "secure site" indicator (CAN-2005-0593)
* Matt Brubeck reported
  a possible Autocomplete data leak (CAN-2005-0589)
* Georgi
  Guninski discovered that XSLT can include stylesheets from arbitrary
  hosts (CAN-2005-0588)
* Secunia discovered a way of injecting
  content into a popup opened by another website (CAN-2004-1156)
* Phil Ringnalda reported a possible way to spoof Install source with
  user:pass@host (CAN-2005-0590)
* Jakob Balle from Secunia
  discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download dialog source
  (CAN-2005-0585)
* Christian Schmidt reported a potential
  spoofing issue in HTTP auth prompt tab (CAN-2005-0584)
* Andreas
  Sanblad from Secunia discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download
  dialog using the Content-Disposition header (CAN-2005-0586)
* Finally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
  discovered that Firefox insecurely creates temporary filenames in
  /tmp/plugtmp (CAN-2005-0578)

### Impact

* By setting up malicious websites and convincing users to
  follow untrusted links or obey very specific drag-and-drop or download
  instructions, attackers may leverage the various spoofing issues to
  fake other websites to get access to confidential information, push
  users to download malicious files or make them interact with their
  browser preferences.
* The temporary directory issue allows
  local attackers to overwrite arbitrary files with the rights of another
  local user.
* The overflow issues, while not thought to be
  exploitable, may allow a malicious downloaded page to execute arbitrary
  code with the rights of the user viewing the page.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.1"
```

All Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.1"
```

# Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-30**

The Mozilla Suite is vulnerable to multiple issues ranging from the remote
execution of arbitrary code to various issues allowing to trick the user
into trusting fake web sites or interacting with privileged content.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.6** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.6** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that
includes a mail and news reader.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla
Suite:

* Mark Dowd from ISS X-Force reported an exploitable
  heap overrun in the GIF processing of obsolete Netscape extension 2
  (CAN-2005-0399)
* Michael Krax reported that plugins can be used
  to load privileged content and trick the user to interact with it
  (CAN-2005-0232, CAN-2005-0527)
* Michael Krax also reported
  potential spoofing or cross-site-scripting issues through overlapping
  windows, image or scrollbar drag-and-drop, and by dropping javascript:
  links on tabs (CAN-2005-0230, CAN-2005-0231, CAN-2005-0401,
  CAN-2005-0591)
* Daniel de Wildt and Gael Delalleau discovered a
  memory overwrite in a string library (CAN-2005-0255)
* Wind Li
  discovered a possible heap overflow in UTF8 to Unicode conversion
  (CAN-2005-0592)
* Eric Johanson reported that Internationalized
  Domain Name (IDN) features allow homograph attacks (CAN-2005-0233)
* Mook, Doug Turner, Kohei Yoshino and M. Deaudelin reported various
  ways of spoofing the SSL "secure site" indicator (CAN-2005-0593)
* Georgi Guninski discovered that XSLT can include stylesheets from
  arbitrary hosts (CAN-2005-0588)
* Secunia discovered a way of
  injecting content into a popup opened by another website
  (CAN-2004-1156)
* Phil Ringnalda reported a possible way to
  spoof Install source with user:pass@host (CAN-2005-0590)
* Jakob
  Balle from Secunia discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download
  dialog source (CAN-2005-0585)
* Christian Schmidt reported a
  potential spoofing issue in HTTP auth prompt tab (CAN-2005-0584)
* Finally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
  discovered that Mozilla insecurely creates temporary filenames in
  /tmp/plugtmp (CAN-2005-0578)

### Impact

* The GIF heap overflow could be triggered by a malicious GIF
  image that would end up executing arbitrary code with the rights of the
  user running Mozilla. The other overflow issues, while not thought to
  be exploitable, would have the same impact
* By setting up
  malicious websites and convincing users to follow untrusted links or
  obey very specific drag-and-drop or download instructions, attackers
  may leverage the various spoofing issues to fake other websites to get
  access to confidential information, push users to download malicious
  files or make them interact with their browser preferences
* The
  temporary directory issue allows local attackers to overwrite arbitrary
  files with the rights of another local user

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.6"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.6"
```
