# Ethereal: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal, which may allow an attacker to
run arbitrary code or crash the program.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/ethereal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.10** |

### Background

Ethereal is a feature rich network protocol analyzer.

### Description

There are multiple vulnerabilities in versions of Ethereal earlier than
0.10.10, including:

* The Etheric, 3GPP2 A11 and IAPP dissectors are vulnerable to buffer
  overflows (CAN-2005-0704, CAN-2005-0699 and CAN-2005-0739).
* The GPRS-LLC could crash when the "ignore cipher bit" option is
  enabled (CAN-2005-0705).
* Various vulnerabilities in JXTA and sFlow dissectors.

### Impact

An attacker might be able to use these vulnerabilities to crash
Ethereal and execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running Ethereal, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

For a temporary workaround you can disable all affected protocol
dissectors. However, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade to the
latest stable version.

### Resolution

All Ethereal users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.10"
```
