{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer overflows in the Etheric, 3GPP2 A11 and IAPP dissectors.",
    "Crash in GPRS-LLC when the \"ignore cipher bit\" option is enabled.",
    "Various vulnerabilities in JXTA and sFlow dissectors."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker might be able to use these vulnerabilities to crash Ethereal and execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Ethereal, which could be the root user.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending specially crafted network packets.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets that can be processed by the vulnerable dissectors."
