# Exim: Two buffer overflows — GLSA **200501-23**

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities, which could lead to arbitrary code
execution, have been found in the handling of IPv6 addresses as well as in
the SPA authentication mechanism in Exim.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-mta/exim** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.43-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.43-r2** |

### Background

Exim is an highly configurable message transfer agent (MTA)
developed at the University of Cambridge.

### Description

Buffer overflows have been found in the host\_aton() function
(CAN-2005-0021) as well as in the spa\_base64\_to\_bits() function
(CAN-2005-0022), which is part of the SPA authentication code.

### Impact

A local attacker could trigger the buffer overflow in host\_aton()
by supplying an illegal IPv6 address with more than 8 components, using
a command line option. The second vulnerability could be remotely
exploited during SPA authentication, if it is enabled on the server.
Both buffer overflows can potentially lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Exim users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-mta/exim-4.43-r2"
```
