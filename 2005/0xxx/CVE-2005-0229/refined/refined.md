- **Root cause of vulnerability:** CitrusDB uses a text file to temporarily store credit card information, and this file is located within the web tree and is accessible via a static URL. The file is not deleted after processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to storing sensitive data (credit card information) in a publicly accessible file within the web root. The file is not deleted after use, which further increases exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Disclosure of credit card information, which can lead to serious liability issues for the site.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can access the file containing credit card data by directly requesting the static URL `io/newfile.txt`. The URL to this file is available in `tools/uploadcc.php` and `tools/importcc.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the path to the CitrusDB installation. They do not need any special privileges or access other than being able to make HTTP requests to the webserver.
