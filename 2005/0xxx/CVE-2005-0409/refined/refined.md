- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient authorization checks in the credit card data upload/import scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Authorization bypass:** The scripts `importcc.php` and `uploadcc.php` only check if a user is logged in, but not if the user has the necessary privileges to perform these actions.
    - **Information Disclosure:** The scripts reveal the path to the temporary file where uploaded credit card data is stored, which can be accessed by an attacker if the path is within the document root.
    - **SQL Injection:** An SQL injection vulnerability is also present, though it is referenced to another CVE (CAN-2005-0410).
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can upload fake credit card data.
    - An attacker can disclose credit card data that has been uploaded to the server.
    - An attacker can potentially execute SQL injection attacks (refer to CAN-2005-0410).
- **Attack vectors:**
    - By sending a crafted POST request to `uploadcc.php` with a CVS file and a valid cookie.
    - By sending a crafted GET request to `index.php` with the parameters `load=importcc&submit=on` and a valid cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be a logged-in user or an attacker that is able to bypass the authentication via a different vulnerability (CAN-2005-0408)
    - The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable scripts `uploadcc.php`, and `index.php`
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
