And I assume the ISO issues do as well.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c1)  Matthew Miller    2005-04-12 19:03:27 UTC  ``` From the FC2 advisory:  [CAN-2005-0210](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-0210) affects only 2.6 kernels; not rh9/fc1.  [CAN-2005-0384](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-0384) seems to affect us as well -- see RHEL [bug #151240](show_bug.cgi?id=151240 "CLOSED ERRATA - CAN-2005-0384 pppd remote DoS")  [CAN-2005-0531](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-0531) advisory didn't test 2.4, but debian says it applies to 2.4.27.               not sure if our 2.4.20 is affected. No RHEL update seems                available.  [CAN-2005-0400](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-0400) affects us, but doesn't seem to severe -- apparently you need to               be superuser to see the exposed info. RHEL [bug #152400](show_bug.cgi?id=152400 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2005-0400 ext2 mkdir() directory entry random kernel memory leak")  [CAN-2005-0449](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-0449) firewall bypass, remote oops, affects 2.4 -- RHEL [bug #151805](show_bug.cgi?id=151805 "CLOSED ERRATA - CAN-2005-0449 Possible remote Oops/firewall bypass - kABI breaker")  [CAN-2005-0736](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-0736) is 2.6 only.

This did not work right away.  In various places there are asignments which precede declarations and a double initialization in a structure.  Also '__attribute__((always_inline))' in brlock.h is causing a constant stream of warnings that a compiler is going to ignore that.  In a definition of 'kernel_prereq' we have 'modutils >= 2.4.18' but later this 'BuildPreReq' wants a higher version which is not available.  After changing that in spec to 2.4.18 and applying an attached patch is is possible to recompile that kernel on an 7.3 installation and results do boot and run. 'rpm' wants some newer versions in user space (SysVinit >= 2.84-13, pam >= 0.75-48, vixie-cron >= 3.0.1-73) and at least for vixie-cron this looks like a valid request.  OTOH my system is operational with this kernel even with these dependencies not satisfied.  I tried only one compilation target (--target=athlon).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c4)  Marc Deslauriers    2005-04-26 23:15:23 UTC  ``` -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Here are new kernel packages to QA for rh7.3:  * Mon Apr 25 2005 Marc Deslauriers <marcdeslauriers> 2.4.20-43.7.legacy -

I looked at it a bit, but am not sure if we're vulnerable to it or not as the nptl backport in the rh9 kernel is a little different. Since it appeared to be a local DoS issue and I don't seem to find similar crash reports with the rh9 kernel, I didn't spend much time with it.

Interestingly I also looked at building 2.4.21-27.0.4.EL for RH8 (built on RH8) but didn't _spot_ any of the compilation problems mentioned in [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c3) so it probably depends on the versions of gcc involved.  On a test i686 machine the resulting kernel seemed to work fine EXCEPT that ntpd kept dying (and I get "out of memory" syslog messages). There are also warnings about crond signal handling but they don't seem to be fatal.  Running ntpd under gdb showed that it crashes (with a SEGV) inside libc calling syslog() (as it reports the change of uid).  I thought maybe that backing out the RHEL patch which moves the mmap default address (which affects where shared-libraries get mapped) might fix it, but it doesn't.  Nor did updating to the ntpd version from RHEL3 help at all.  So far ntpd is the only thing which shows any problems, but I suspect that whatever the real problem is will probably affect (a few) others too. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.2.1 (GNU/Linux)  iD8DBQFCeM2+S5LuHfP34NgRAtHDAKCzM6kk8diP3gswguYehfJjz7DjJgCff3BA 7fRhpIsrLhf3AnJibNJTQCE= =Dt1u -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----    ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c20)  Matthew Miller    2005-05-04 13:42:34 UTC  ``` For what it's worth, no reports of ntp dying on the RHL9-based machines we've got this running on here.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c21)  Marc Deslauriers    2005-05-04 22:13:51 UTC  ``` Rebuilding a RHEL3 kernel for RHL 7.3 and 8.0 is not a viable solution as the kernel contains the backported nptl code. A bunch of other packages not compatible with nptl would need to get backported also, including a new glibc...  In other words, way too complicated to get working properly...   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c22)  Matthew Miller    2005-05-04 23:03:41 UTC  ``` What about moving to that for rhl9?   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c23)  Marc Deslauriers    2005-05-04 23:42:32 UTC  ``` Well, since rh7.3 and rh9 share the same kernel, it would actually be _more_ work for us if we do that for rh9.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c24)  Matthew Miller    2005-05-05 04:01:54 UTC  ``` Okay, sounds like pretty solid reasoning. :)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c25)  John Dalbec    2005-05-05 12:08:43 UTC  ``` Re: [Comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c21) I haven't looked at the kernel source for RHEL3, but in the RHL9 kernel source building for RHL7.3 is just a matter of changing %nptlarchs.  Is there a similar switch in the RHEL3 kernel source?   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c26)  Marc Deslauriers    2005-05-05 12:15:42 UTC  ``` Unfortunately, no.  If I remember correctly the last time I checked it out, the nptl patches were integrated with a bunch of other stuff also, as was done with the FC1 kernel.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c27)  Marc Deslauriers    2005-05-05 12:17:42 UTC  ``` Just to clear things up, [comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c19) was saying the RHEL kernel he tried to build was breaking things, not the rh9 kernel that we've got in updates-testing.     ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c28)  Jonathan Peatfield    2005-05-12 08:50:38 UTC  ``` Indeed!  The rh73 (essentially since rh8 is also lacking the ntpl stuff) based kernels are working fine on ~200 machines.  I had *reasoned* that even if a kernel offers nptl facilities code/libs which know nothing about that won't try to use them (after all statically linked non-nptl aware code works fine on RHEL systems).  However something else clearly also changed at about the same time (maybe something as small as the precise locations where allocations happen to occur, and that showed up some problem inside libc).  That ntpd happened to be the first (only one I noticed) app which fails just shows that it was more sensitive to whatever the changes were.  A co-worker with RH9 machines tested a RHEL3 kernel and ntpd dies for him too.  Strange but true.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c29)  jens.koerber    2005-05-18 21:17:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 114534](attachment.cgi?id=114534&action=diff "CAN-2005-1263") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=114534&action=edit "CAN-2005-1263") [CAN-2005-1263](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-1263)  another one ...  btw: I'm running kernel-2.4.22-1.2199.5 without problems for some time now ...   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c30)  Pekka Savola    2005-05-31 07:21:07 UTC  ``` -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1   Verifying for RHL73 and RHL9: signature/PGP key OK, installed uniprocessor versions, which seem to work fine so far.   +VERIFY RHL73, RHL9   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.0.7 (GNU/Linux)   iD8DBQFCnA+ZGHbTkzxSL7QRAnsNAKCC414CkpZdr+6pp2glzezP+UDkcgCg15Mu O2QkNFmPDIXJszL28WSuI68= =X1W2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  FWIW, ntpd works fine here..   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c31)  John Dalbec    2005-05-31 21:16:26 UTC  ``` I installed the -bigmem kernel (with ReiserFS patches added) on a production webserver Friday.

The patches in the srpms mentioned in #4 (and #5) seem entriely reasonable and I've personally been running essentially the RH73 version from #4 (though rebuilt on RH8), on ~220 machines since 10th May (a bit longer on ~5 test boxes).  As more security pathces become needed will this one drag on like some of the earlier attempts to provide updated kernels?  Since I don't personally have any RH73/9/FC1 boxes there is probably not much I can actually do involving verifications etc.  I'm happy to lift patches from here (and elsewhere) and verify that they seem to be doing sane things, but that may not help you much...   -- Jon   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c34)  Marc Deslauriers    2005-06-02 20:16:32 UTC  ``` I am going to release this tonight or tomorrow...   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=152532#c35)  Marc Deslauriers    2005-06-04 19:46:50 UTC  ``` These were officially released.   ``` |  |
