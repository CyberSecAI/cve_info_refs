# GProFTPD: gprostats format string vulnerability — GLSA **200502-26**

gprostats, distributed with GProFTPD, is vulnerable to a format string
vulnerability, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/gproftpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **8.1.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **8.1.9** |

### Background

GProFTPD is a GTK+ administration tool for the ProFTPD server. GProFTPD
is distributed with gprostats, a utility to parse ProFTPD transfer
logs.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team has identified a
format string vulnerability in the gprostats utility.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by performing a specially
crafted FTP transfer, the resulting ProFTPD transfer log could
potentially trigger the execution of arbitrary code when parsed by
GProFTPD.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GProFTPD users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/gproftpd-8.1.9"
```

| [Description](#c0)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-13 11:53:36 UTC  ``` The gproftpd source code is badly written. Lots of sprintf, strcat (versus snprintf and strncat), allowing stack and heap overflows.  The package should be masked. I have notified the author of problems.  I haven't patched it as it'd be a big patch and I don't use the software.  I haven't attempted to exploit any of the overflows but it should be possible.  Marked critical as it should be trivial to exploit.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-13 11:58:43 UTC  ``` Could you provide an example of where user/network input is taken and can be  abused. I often see programs which do not use snprintf()/strncat() but do so  in a semi safe way (kernel) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Andreas Kling    2005-02-13 14:42:43 UTC  ``` Here's a nice (and not too revealing) example from callbacks.c:  sprintf(user_pass, "usermod -p '%s' %s", encrypted_pass, username);  Try changing a user's password in gproftpd while grep'ing for usermod processes.  You will catch something like this:   8715 pts/8    D+     0:00 usermod -p $1$is54ShF3$4RUrFy9d8D8I0VCBlo5c91 test_user  This package should be blocked. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-13 15:10:45 UTC  ``` Try typing lots of stuff in the DNS server text entry box and hitting add server, overflow in xfer_update. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-13 16:28:14 UTC  ``` oh this is nice the package is maintained by bug-wranglers@gentoo.org 2 votes for masking now. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Andrea Barisani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-13 16:29:08 UTC  ``` /me votes for masking it ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-13 16:40:45 UTC  ``` I lied, the overflow isn't related to the text field at all.  bzero(&(myaddr.sin_zero), sizeof(myaddr));  in xfer_update, callbacks.c.  It overflows itself, doesn't need user help :P ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-14 01:15:50 UTC  ``` Having looked post-coffee this morning I think I over-reacted here. The code is indeed crap, but I can't see anything exploitable, even if it does have stupid self-inflicted overflow in it.  There is an information leak as noted by Andreas.  Maybe if someone with more knowledge than me could review the code? ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-14 02:26:22 UTC  ``` The code popens "ftpwho" in callbacks.c if something (anything) is listening on the port which is metioned in proftpd.conf. An evil ftpwho in my path:  --- "exploit" --- rob@leet ~ $ cat bin/ftpwho  #!/usr/bin/perl  print 'v' x 68000; --- end ---  This causes a segfault. I assume this is exploitable, can someone who knows better than me check please? ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-14 03:52:33 UTC  ``` its possible to overflow tempname in callbacks.c:user_exists by having a passwd line longer than 4096. Quite how you'd manage to get that I don't know... chfn limits you to a total of 80 chars for the gecos field. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Andreas Kling    2005-02-14 05:19:51 UTC  ``` If the proftpd daemon is running without a MaxInstance limit (not default), spawn about ~500 simultaneous connections (no authentication required) and gproftpd will overflow in a strcat() call. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-15 02:40:47 UTC  ``` A new version has been released which fixes the ftpwho overflow. I'll let Magnus know about the passwd/ps listing bugs. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-15 08:45:39 UTC  ``` There's an remotely exploitable format string vulnerability in the gprostats log parser, users can trigger it by putting or fetching a specally crafted filename:  the vulnerable statements:  314: snprintf(datestamp, x+1, old_buffer);  obvious fix, add "%s" as arg3.   demo:  $ lftp taviso@localhost Password:  lftp taviso@localhost:~> put /dev/null -o foo%.500nbar lftp taviso@localhost:~> exit                  which generates the xferlog line:  Tue Feb 15 16:43:07 2005 0 localhost 0 /home/taviso/foo%.500nbar b _ i r taviso ftp 1 * c  running gprostats:  $ gdb /usr/sbin/gprostats  GNU gdb 6.0 Copyright 2003 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
