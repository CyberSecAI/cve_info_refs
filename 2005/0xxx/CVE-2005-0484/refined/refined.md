Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a format string bug located in the `gprostats` utility, which is distributed with GProFTPD. This vulnerability is triggered when `gprostats` parses a ProFTPD transfer log file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The `gprostats` utility uses `snprintf` with a format string derived from the log file without proper sanitization. Specifically, the code was using `snprintf(datestamp, x+1, old_buffer);` where `old_buffer` comes from the log file, without including the format string specifier `%s`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious filename that, when included in the ProFTPD transfer log, will be parsed by `gprostats` and trigger the format string vulnerability. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `gprostats`.
- **Segmentation Fault/Denial of Service:**  Even without successful code execution, the format string vulnerability can cause a segmentation fault, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely by performing a specially crafted FTP transfer. The crafted filename in the transfer would then appear in the ProFTPD transfer log.
- **Log File Parsing:** The `gprostats` utility parses the transfer log, leading to the vulnerability when the crafted filename is processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **FTP Access:** The attacker needs to be able to perform FTP transfers to the server running ProFTPD. This allows the attacker to insert malicious filenames into the transfer logs.
- **Triggering gprostats:** The attacker needs the `gprostats` utility to parse the log file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team.
- The vulnerable code snippet is in `gprostats.c`.
- The issue was fixed in `gproftpd` version 8.1.9 by adding a format string specifier in the `snprintf` call.
- The bug report also notes other, less critical, issues, including information leaks and local overflows, which were not directly related to the CVE.
- There was an additional local format string vulnerability found when reading the config file which was also fixed in 8.1.9
