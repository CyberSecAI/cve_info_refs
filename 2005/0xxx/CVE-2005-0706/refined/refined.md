Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2005-0706:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow occurs in Grip when processing CDDB responses from a server. Specifically, the application writes past the end of a stack-based array when the CDDB server returns more than 16 matches (exact or inexact) for a CD.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious CDDB server could cause Grip to crash by returning more than 16 matches, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
- Attackers could embed exploit code within overflowing matches in the CDDB response.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via a malicious or compromised CDDB server.
- A hostile 3rd party submitter to the CDDB server could embed malicious code into the overflowing matches.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to control the CDDB server response or submit manipulated data to the CDDB server.
- Must be able to send a crafted CDDB response to a vulnerable instance of Grip.
