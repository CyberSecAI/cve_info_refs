## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-18

## Memory overwrite in string library

Announced
February 24, 2005
Reporter
Daniel de Wildt
Risk
Low
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.1
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.6
* Thunderbird 1.0.2

### Description

Daniel de Wildt discovered a memory handling flaw in Mozilla string
classes that could overwrite memory at a fixed location if
reallocation fails during string growth. This could theoretically
lead to arbitrary code execution. Creating the exact conditions
for exploitation--including running out of memory at just the right
moment--is unlikely.

This flaw was independently discovered by Gaël Delalleau and
reported by iDEFENSE

### Workaround

Upgrade to a fixed version

# Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-30**

The Mozilla Suite is vulnerable to multiple issues ranging from the remote
execution of arbitrary code to various issues allowing to trick the user
into trusting fake web sites or interacting with privileged content.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.6** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.6** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that
includes a mail and news reader.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla
Suite:

* Mark Dowd from ISS X-Force reported an exploitable
  heap overrun in the GIF processing of obsolete Netscape extension 2
  (CAN-2005-0399)
* Michael Krax reported that plugins can be used
  to load privileged content and trick the user to interact with it
  (CAN-2005-0232, CAN-2005-0527)
* Michael Krax also reported
  potential spoofing or cross-site-scripting issues through overlapping
  windows, image or scrollbar drag-and-drop, and by dropping javascript:
  links on tabs (CAN-2005-0230, CAN-2005-0231, CAN-2005-0401,
  CAN-2005-0591)
* Daniel de Wildt and Gael Delalleau discovered a
  memory overwrite in a string library (CAN-2005-0255)
* Wind Li
  discovered a possible heap overflow in UTF8 to Unicode conversion
  (CAN-2005-0592)
* Eric Johanson reported that Internationalized
  Domain Name (IDN) features allow homograph attacks (CAN-2005-0233)
* Mook, Doug Turner, Kohei Yoshino and M. Deaudelin reported various
  ways of spoofing the SSL "secure site" indicator (CAN-2005-0593)
* Georgi Guninski discovered that XSLT can include stylesheets from
  arbitrary hosts (CAN-2005-0588)
* Secunia discovered a way of
  injecting content into a popup opened by another website
  (CAN-2004-1156)
* Phil Ringnalda reported a possible way to
  spoof Install source with user:pass@host (CAN-2005-0590)
* Jakob
  Balle from Secunia discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download
  dialog source (CAN-2005-0585)
* Christian Schmidt reported a
  potential spoofing issue in HTTP auth prompt tab (CAN-2005-0584)
* Finally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
  discovered that Mozilla insecurely creates temporary filenames in
  /tmp/plugtmp (CAN-2005-0578)

### Impact

* The GIF heap overflow could be triggered by a malicious GIF
  image that would end up executing arbitrary code with the rights of the
  user running Mozilla. The other overflow issues, while not thought to
  be exploitable, would have the same impact
* By setting up
  malicious websites and convincing users to follow untrusted links or
  obey very specific drag-and-drop or download instructions, attackers
  may leverage the various spoofing issues to fake other websites to get
  access to confidential information, push users to download malicious
  files or make them interact with their browser preferences
* The
  temporary directory issue allows local attackers to overwrite arbitrary
  files with the rights of another local user

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.6"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.6"
```

# Mozilla Firefox: Various vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-10**

Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to a local file deletion issue and to various
issues allowing to trick the user into trusting fake web sites or
interacting with privileged content.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is the popular next-generation browser from the
Mozilla project.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla
Firefox:

* Michael Krax reported that plugins can be used
  to load privileged content and trick the user to interact with it
  (CAN-2005-0232, CAN-2005-0527)
* Michael Krax also reported
  potential spoofing or cross-site-scripting issues through overlapping
  windows, image drag-and-drop, and by dropping javascript: links on tabs
  (CAN-2005-0230, CAN-2005-0231, CAN-2005-0591)
* Daniel de Wildt
  and Gael Delalleau discovered a memory overwrite in a string library
  (CAN-2005-0255)
* Wind Li discovered a possible heap overflow in
  UTF8 to Unicode conversion (CAN-2005-0592)
* Eric Johanson
  reported that Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) features allow
  homograph attacks (CAN-2005-0233)
* Mook, Doug Turner, Kohei
  Yoshino and M. Deaudelin reported various ways of spoofing the SSL
  "secure site" indicator (CAN-2005-0593)
* Matt Brubeck reported
  a possible Autocomplete data leak (CAN-2005-0589)
* Georgi
  Guninski discovered that XSLT can include stylesheets from arbitrary
  hosts (CAN-2005-0588)
* Secunia discovered a way of injecting
  content into a popup opened by another website (CAN-2004-1156)
* Phil Ringnalda reported a possible way to spoof Install source with
  user:pass@host (CAN-2005-0590)
* Jakob Balle from Secunia
  discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download dialog source
  (CAN-2005-0585)
* Christian Schmidt reported a potential
  spoofing issue in HTTP auth prompt tab (CAN-2005-0584)
* Andreas
  Sanblad from Secunia discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download
  dialog using the Content-Disposition header (CAN-2005-0586)
* Finally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
  discovered that Firefox insecurely creates temporary filenames in
  /tmp/plugtmp (CAN-2005-0578)

### Impact

* By setting up malicious websites and convincing users to
  follow untrusted links or obey very specific drag-and-drop or download
  instructions, attackers may leverage the various spoofing issues to
  fake other websites to get access to confidential information, push
  users to download malicious files or make them interact with their
  browser preferences.
* The temporary directory issue allows
  local attackers to overwrite arbitrary files with the rights of another
  local user.
* The overflow issues, while not thought to be
  exploitable, may allow a malicious downloaded page to execute arbitrary
  code with the rights of the user viewing the page.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.1"
```

All Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
