- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The AnswerBook2 administrative interface displays log files (access and error logs) as HTML instead of plain text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of log file contents when displayed within the administrative interface. This allows injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the logs. When the administrator views these logs via the web interface, the injected code is executed in the administrator's browser. This can lead to various attacks against the administrator, such as session hijacking or other browser-based exploits that can potentially escalate privileges on the host operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could inject malicious content into the logs, possibly by sending specially crafted requests to the AnswerBook2 server or exploiting other application vulnerabilities that result in log entries containing malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to generate log entries containing malicious code. This could be achieved via any method that logs a URL, user agent string, or other user-controlled input. The attacker does not need access to the server's file system directly.
