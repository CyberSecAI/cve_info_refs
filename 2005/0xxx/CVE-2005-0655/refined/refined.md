Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Aura CMS:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A. Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application doesn't handle invalid SQL queries properly. When a malicious SQL fragment is injected through the `id` or `topik` parameters, the application throws an error that includes the full path of the vulnerable PHP file.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate input sanitization and error handling.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of the server's internal file structure, which can aid attackers in further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request with crafted `id` or `topik` parameters.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires the ability to make HTTP requests to the web application.

*   **B. Session ID Exposure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application uses variables in PHP files (like `hits` in `hits.php`) without proper initialization and sanitization, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript injection via GET parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and output encoding, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Uninitialized variables.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of user session IDs via `document.cookie`, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to the application and user accounts.
    *  **Attack Vectors:**
        * HTTP GET request to `hits.php` with a malicious `hits` parameter.
        * HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a malicious `query` parameter within the search functionality.
        * HTTP GET request to `counter.php` with a malicious `theCount` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires the ability to make HTTP requests and inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The report mentions that the application uses both session and cookie-based authentication, but the issue is specifically with the session method.
*   The report indicates that the vendor was notified but no patch was available at the time of publication (March 2nd, 2005).

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

The Aura CMS version 1.5 has two types of vulnerabilities: full path disclosure and session ID exposure via XSS. The full path disclosure is due to inadequate error handling of database queries. The session ID exposure is caused by lack of sanitization of GET parameters, allowing for XSS injection. Both vulnerabilities could be exploited by an attacker who can send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and allow for gathering information on the server, stealing session IDs and impersonating users.
