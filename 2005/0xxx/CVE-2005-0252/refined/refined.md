The provided content is related to CVE-2005-0252.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization when authenticating users against a MySQL database, allowing for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the username and password fields during authentication when using MySQL as the authorization backend.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can bypass authentication and gain admin privileges by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the login form of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the web application. They do not need prior valid credentials. The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries within the username and password fields.

**Technical details:**
The proof of concept shows how to inject SQL code into the username and password fields using `x' or 1=1 or login='x` for username and `x') or 1=1 or password=md5('x` for password. This bypasses authentication and potentially grants admin access.
