{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `script_root` variable, used in include statements, is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary File Inclusion vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization for the `script_root` variable, leading to the inclusion of remote files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP files from a remote server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the webserver and the execution of arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL and exploiting the vulnerable `script_root` variable via HTTP GET parameter, an attacker can include a remote file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable software and the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The server must also have `register_globals` set to on and `allow_url_fopen` set to on for this exploit to work."
