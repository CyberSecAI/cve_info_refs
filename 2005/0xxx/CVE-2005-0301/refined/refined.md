Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities identified in Comersus ASP Shopping Cart versions 6.0 and 6.0.1, which are related to CVE-2005-0301:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Bypassing Administrator Login:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The file `/backofficelite/comersus_backoffice_install10.asp`, intended for the final step of installation, sets `session("admin")=1` without requiring prior authentication.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of access control on the installation script.
    *   **Impact:**  An unauthenticated attacker can gain full administrative privileges by simply executing this script, allowing them to access all administrative functionalities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the vulnerable script through a web browser.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs network access to the web server.

2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/store/default.asp` script directly inserts user-supplied data from the `HTTP_Referer` header into an SQL query without sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation/sanitization of the `pReferrer` variable.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a malicious HTTP GET request with SQL code in the `Referer` header.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs network access to the web server.

3.  **Design Flaw (Password Encryption):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The encryption key for user passwords is stored in the same database as the encrypted passwords.
    *   **Weakness:**  The encryption key is not stored securely and can be obtained by an attacker with access to the database.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker with access to the database can obtain the encryption key and use it to decrypt user passwords, leading to a compromise of user accounts.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Gaining access to the database.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs database access.

4.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `error` parameter in `/comersus/backofficelite/comersus_supportError.asp` and `/comersus/backofficelite/comersus_backofficelite_supportError.asp` is not sanitized before being displayed.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding/sanitization of the `error` parameter.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application which can be executed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing, or defacement.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `error` parameter.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs network access to the web server.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vendor, Comersus, responded quickly and released version 6.0.2 to address these issues.
*   The advisory also suggests workarounds for these vulnerabilities, such as deleting the installation file, disabling visitor logging, or moving the encryption key.
