- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `index.php` script within the `citrusdb/tools/` directory uses a GET parameter named `load` to include PHP files. The script does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to use relative path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) within the `load` parameter to include arbitrary PHP files from the server's filesystem.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability leading to arbitrary file inclusion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP files present on the server's filesystem if accessible by the script, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and underlying system depending on the content of included files.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to the `citrusdb/tools/index.php` script with a crafted `load` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be logged in to access the vulnerable script.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or have access to a malicious php file on the server.
