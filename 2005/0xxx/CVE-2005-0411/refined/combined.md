### Introduction
Description from vendor:
"CitrusDB is an open source customer database
application that uses PHP and a database backend (currently MySQL) to keep
track of customer information, services, products, billing, and customer
service information."
It is possible to include any local accessible .php file.
### More Details
CitrusDB uses a wrapper script (./citrusdb/tools/index.php) to load different
modules and tools. The GET parameter "load" specifies which file should be
included. With a relative path appended any .php file, that may be accessed
by the script, on the server may be included.
### Proof of Concept
To include /tmp/exploit.php use:
```
http:///citrusdb/tools/index.php?load=../../../../../../tmp/exploit
```
Note: You need to be logged in to access this url.
### Workaround

### Fix
n/a (2005-02-03)
### Security Risk
The security risk is rated medium. An attacker needs to be able to create a
.php file on the local filesystem which is normally a high barrier but in
shared hosting enviroments this may be easier.
