  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The NetWorker software uses the AUTH_UNIX authentication mechanism, which relies solely on the authentication credentials provided by the client.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak authentication: AUTH_UNIX does not provide sufficient protection against attacks because it trusts the client-provided authentication information.",
      "Spoofing: Attackers can spoof user names and UIDs to bypass authentication mechanisms in various NetWorker components."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can:\n\t* Execute arbitrary commands on a NetWorker client system.\n\t* View or modify the configuration of the NetWorker server.\n\t* Cause a denial-of-service condition by altering the ports used by NetWorker.\n\t* View files backed up by any other NetWorker client, regardless of file permissions.\nA local user can gain elevated privileges on a system running NetWorker.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote network access to vulnerable NetWorker components using RPC, or local access to a system running the vulnerable software.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable NetWorker services and spoof user IDs or UIDs."
