Debian Security Advisory DSA 692-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
March 8th, 2005                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : kdenetwork
Vulnerability  : design flaw
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0205

The KDE team fixed a bug in kppp in 2002 which was now discovered to be
exploitable by iDEFENSE.  By opening a sufficiently large number of
file descriptors before executing kppp which is installed setuid root a
local attacker is able to take over privileged file descriptors.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-14.7.

The testing (sarge) and unstable (sid) distributions are not affected
since KDE 3.2 already contained the correction.

We recommend that you upgrade your kppp package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

KDE Security Advisory: kppp Privileged fd Leak Vulnerability
Original Release Date: 2005-02-28
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20050228-1.txt
0. References
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0205
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?type=vulnerabilities
1. Systems affected:
kppp as included in KDE up to including KDE 3.1.5. KDE 3.2.x
and newer are not affected.
2. Overview:
kppp, if installed suid root, allows local attackers to hijack
a system's domain name resolution function.
A fix introduced for a similiar vulnerability, added to the code
base in 1998, was incomplete and can be bypassed.
In 2002 a proper fix was made by Dirk Mueller for KDE 3.2 as part
of a code audit. No advisory was issued because the problem was
considered to be unexploitable at that time. iDEFENSE now
rediscovered the issue and supplied an example exploit for this
vulnerability.
3. Impact:
Modifications to /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf can be done by
local users which allows manipulation of host and domain name
lookups, enabling other phishing and social engineering attacks.
4. Solution:
Source code patches have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
5. Patch:
A patch for KDE 3.1 is available from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security\_patches :
0e999df54963edd5f565b6d541f408d9 post-3.1.5-kdenetwork.diff
