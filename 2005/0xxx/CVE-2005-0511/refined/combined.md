How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  ## vBulletin 3.0.7 Released - Security Patch

  Sat 19 Feb '05, 10:40am

  **vBulletin 3.0.7**

  The discovery of a potentially serious security hole has necessitated the release of vBulletin 3.0.7. All customers are strongly encouraged to take one of the actions described in this post.

  All versions of vBulletin 3 up to and including 3.0.6 are affected only if you have enabled the *Add Template Name in HTML Comments* option (Admin Control Panel -> vBulletin Options -> General Settings). We hope most of you will not have had this option enabled anyway, as it is mostly for debugging and wastes a fair amount of bandwidth on a production site.

  Thus, to fix the issue, you should choose one of these options:
  1. Disable the *Add Template Name in HTML Comments* option on your board.
  2. Download the zip file attached to this post (or from [here](http://www.vbulletin.com/members/getfile.php/patch_307.zip)) and overwrite the misc.php in the main vBulletin directory on your server with the version in the zip. (More extensive instructions are provided in the zip file.)
  3. Upgrade to 3.0.7. A link to upgrade instructions is provided below.We would strongly recommend options 2 or 3 if possible.

  **The Importance of Keeping Current with Security Updates**

  We would like to take this time to reiterate the importance of keeping current with security updates. If you are not currently running a version with the recent patches built in or have not manually patched your board, please see the [3.0.5](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showthread.php?t=125480) and [3.0.6](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showthread.php?t=127027) announcements for important patches.

  Recently, more issues have been discovered than we would have liked, but we try to make patching as painless as possible to ease the burden these issues create. We are looking into ways to make patch delivery even easier for future versions.

  **Backing Up Your Forums**

  Please be sure to check that your backups are complete before continuing with an upgrade. We had reports that PHP was causing time out errors when creating the back up SQL, and this was causing for incomplete or corrupted backups. The safest way to do a backup is to use the [mysqldump utility through SSH/Telnet,](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/maintenance_ssh_backup) as it will not suffer from any such problems. Full instructions for backing up your database are available in the [vBulletin 3 Manual](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/manual_database_backup).

  **Installing or Upgrading vBulletin**

  Please see the appropriate manual sections: [Installing vBulletin](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/install) and [Upgrading vBulletin](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/upgrade).

  Requires Revert: Yes to gain this functionality.

  **pm\_messagelist\_periodgroup**Added a conditional to the colspan to prevent an empty column from being displayed if icons are disabled.

  Requires revert? No.

  **SHOWTHREAD**Added a conditional to add some spacing below the posts when using the legacy postbit. See [this bug](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/bugs.php?do=view&bugid=3780).

  Requires revert? No.
