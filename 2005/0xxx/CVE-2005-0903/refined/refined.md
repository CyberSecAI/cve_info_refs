- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malformed JPEG file with a crafted Huffman table segment causes a buffer overflow in QuickTime PictureViewer. Specifically, the length field in the DHT segment is modified to a larger value which leads to a buffer overflow when Quicktime processes the image.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in QuickTime PictureViewer when processing a malformed JPEG file, specifically in the handling of DHT (Huffman table) segments.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Crash of QuickTime PictureViewer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if an exploit is crafted.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a specially crafted JPEG file with a modified DHT segment to QuickTime PictureViewer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious JPEG file to a user who opens it with QuickTime PictureViewer.
