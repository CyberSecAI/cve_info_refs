Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in OWL Intranet Engine:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `browse.php` script doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied parameters before using them to construct HTML code, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `browse.php` script is vulnerable because it directly uses unsanitized input parameters in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XSS:** Lack of input validation and output encoding allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code, leading to XSS attacks. The specific vulnerable parameters mentioned are `expand` and `order`.
*  **SQL Injection:** Lack of proper input sanitization and parameterized queries allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code through the `parent` and `sortposted` parameters in `browse.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Successful XSS exploitation can lead to:
    *   Stealing of session cookies, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user.
    *   Redirection of users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Potential execution of malicious client-side code.
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL injection exploitation can lead to:
    *   Unauthorized access to the database and potentially sensitive information.
    *   Modification or deletion of data within the database.
    *   Potential execution of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   Attackers craft URLs containing malicious JavaScript in the `expand` or `order` parameters and trick users into clicking them.
    *   Attackers can use stored XSS by injecting malicious code that gets stored in the database and is then rendered to other users.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    * Attackers craft URLs containing malicious SQL code in the `parent` or `sortposted` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious code and either directly share them to victims, or have a mechanism for users to unknowingly access them (stored XSS).
*   For SQL injection, the attacker needs to be able to access and modify the URL with the malicious SQL queries.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability report specifically mentions OWL versions 0.7 and 0.8 as affected.
*   The issues are reported to be fixed in the CVS (Concurrent Versions System), indicating that newer versions should be patched.
