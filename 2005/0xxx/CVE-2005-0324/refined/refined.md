Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-0324 (Based on the content, the specific CVE was not mentioned but the provided information matches the description of CVE-2005-0324)

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is improper handling of user-supplied input within the webmail component of Infinite Mobile Delivery v2.6, specifically when processing user names and folder paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user input when handling usernames. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the username field, which will then be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the server reflects this unsanitized input in an error message.
   - **Information Disclosure:** The application leaks the installation path of the software by reflecting the server's file system structure in an error message when invalid characters are provided in the 'Folder:' parameter of the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the web page, and redirection to malicious websites.
   - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can discover the server's file system path and potentially identify other sensitive configuration details or files.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - **XSS:** The XSS attack vector is a crafted URL with malicious JavaScript in the username field.
   - **Information Disclosure:** The information disclosure attack vector involves a crafted URL with invalid file system characters in the 'Folder:' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker must be able to craft a URL with malicious code in the username field to exploit the XSS vulnerability. The attacker must also have some level of knowledge of the application's behaviour.
   - For the information disclosure, the attacker just needs to craft a URL with the 'Folder:' parameter with invalid file system characters.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The vendor, Captaris, Inc., is no longer developing Infinite Mobile Delivery, and therefore no patch is available.
   - The vulnerability was reported in November 2004, and the advisory was published on January 29, 2005.
