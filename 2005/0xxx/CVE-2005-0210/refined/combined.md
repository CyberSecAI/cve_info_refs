How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2005%3A366)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

[Updated 9 August 2005]
The advisory text has been updated to show that this update fixed the
security issue named CAN-2005-0210 but not CAN-2005-0209. The issue
CAN-2005-0209 was actually fixed by RHSA-2005:420. No changes have been
made to the packages associated with this advisory.

## Description

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

A flaw in the fib\_seq\_start function was discovered. A local user could use
this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) via /proc/net/route.
(CAN-2005-1041)

A flaw in the tmpfs file system was discovered. A local user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CAN-2005-0977)

An integer overflow flaw was found when writing to a sysfs file. A local
user could use this flaw to overwrite kernel memory, causing a denial of
service (system crash) or arbitrary code execution. (CAN-2005-0867)

Keith Owens reported a flaw in the Itanium unw\_unwind\_to\_user function. A
local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash)
on Itanium architectures. (CAN-2005-0135)

A flaw in the NFS client O\_DIRECT error case handling was discovered. A
local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CAN-2005-0207)

A small memory leak when defragmenting local packets was discovered that
affected the Linux 2.6 kernel netfilter subsystem. A local user could send
a large number of carefully crafted fragments leading to memory exhaustion
(CAN-2005-0210)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux PPP driver. On systems allowing remote
users to connect to a server using ppp, a remote client could cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CAN-2005-0384)

A flaw was discovered in the ext2 file system code. When a new directory is
created, the ext2 block written to disk is not initialized, which could
lead to an information leak if a disk image is made available to
unprivileged users. (CAN-2005-0400)

A flaw in fragment queuing was discovered that affected the Linux kernel
netfilter subsystem. On systems configured to filter or process network
packets (e.g. firewalling), a remote attacker could send a carefully
crafted set of fragmented packets to a machine and cause a denial of
service (system crash). In order to sucessfully exploit this flaw, the
attacker would need to know or guess some aspects of the firewall ruleset
on the target system. (CAN-2005-0449)

A number of flaws were found in the Linux 2.6 kernel. A local user could
use these flaws to read kernel memory or cause a denial of service (crash).
(CAN-2005-0529, CAN-2005-0530, CAN-2005-0531)

An integer overflow in sys\_epoll\_wait in eventpoll.c was discovered. A
local user could use this flaw to overwrite low kernel memory. This memory
is usually unused, not usually resulting in a security consequence.
(CAN-2005-0736)

A flaw when freeing a pointer in load\_elf\_library was discovered. A local
user could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash).
(CAN-2005-0749)

A flaw was discovered in the bluetooth driver system. On systems where the
bluetooth modules are loaded, a local user could use this flaw to gain
elevated (root) privileges. (CAN-2005-0750)

A race condition was discovered that affected the Radeon DRI driver. A
local user who has DRI privileges on a Radeon graphics card may be able to
use this flaw to gain root privileges. (CAN-2005-0767)

Multiple range checking flaws were discovered in the iso9660 file system
handler. An attacker could create a malicious file system image which would
cause a denial or service or potentially execute arbitrary code if mounted.
(CAN-2005-0815)

A flaw was discovered when setting line discipline on a serial tty. A local
user may be able to use this flaw to inject mouse movements or keystrokes
when another user is logged in. (CAN-2005-0839)

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels
to the packages associated with their machine architectures and
configurations as listed in this erratum.

a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) (CAN-2005-0136)

* a flaw in stack expansion that allowed a local user of mlockall()

to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) (CAN-2005-0179)

* a small memory leak in network packet defragmenting that allowed a

remote user to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) on
 systems using netfilter (CAN-2005-0210)

* flaws in ptrace() syscall handling on AMD64 and Intel EM64T systems

that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash)
 (CAN-2005-0756, CAN-2005-1762, CAN-2005-2553)

* flaws in ISO-9660 file system handling that allowed the mounting of

an invalid image on a CD-ROM to cause a denial of service (crash)
 or potentially execute arbitrary code (CAN-2005-0815)

* a flaw in ptrace() syscall handling on Itanium systems that allowed

a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) (CAN-2005-1761)

* a flaw in the alternate stack switching on AMD64 and Intel EM64T

systems that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service
 (crash) (CAN-2005-1767)

* race conditions in the ia32-compat support for exec() syscalls on

AMD64, Intel EM64T, and Itanium systems that could allow a local
 user to cause a denial of service (crash) (CAN-2005-1768)

* flaws in IPSEC network handling that allowed a local user to cause

a denial of service or potentially gain privileges (CAN-2005-2456,
 CAN-2005-2555)

* a flaw in sendmsg() syscall handling on 64-bit systems that allowed

a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially gain
 privileges (CAN-2005-2490)

* flaws in unsupported modules that allowed denial-of-service attacks

(crashes) or local privilege escalations on systems using the drm,
 coda, or moxa modules (CAN-2004-1056, CAN-2005-0124, CAN-2005-0504)

* potential leaks of kernel data from jfs and ext2 file system handling

(CAN-2004-0181, CAN-2005-0400)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
