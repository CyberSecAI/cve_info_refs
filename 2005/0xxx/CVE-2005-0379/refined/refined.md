Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: File Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** Input validation flaws in `_head.php`, `include/write.php`, and `outlogin.php` allow for directory traversal using null byte injection. The application uses `include` with a user-controlled path, and the filtering logic is insufficient. Specifically, it filters out `://` but not `../` or null bytes (`%00`). When `magic_quotes_gpc` is off in PHP, null bytes are not stripped and can terminate paths prematurely.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation, reliance on `magic_quotes_gpc` being on, improper filtering of path traversal characters and null bytes.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can disclose sensitive files by manipulating the `_zb_path` or `dir` parameters. For example, they can read `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts (`_head.php`, `include/write.php`, `outlogin.php`) with a crafted `_zb_path` or `dir` parameter containing directory traversal sequences and a null byte.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable ZeroBoard application.  PHP's magic quotes feature has to be turned off.

**Vulnerability 2: PHP Source Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** Uninitialized `$dir` variable in `include/print_category.php`. The application directly includes the contents of the variable, leading to PHP code injection.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of variable initialization and usage of `include` with a user-controlled path.
*  **Impact:** Attackers can include remote PHP files from their own servers using the `dir` parameter. This can be used for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP GET request to `include/print_category.php` with the `setup[use_category]` parameter set to `1` and a crafted `dir` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled URL. The php.ini needs to have both register_globals and allow_url_fopen enabled.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server. The PHP settings of the web server has to be configured with register_globals=On and allow_url_fopen=On.

**Vulnerability 3: PHP Source Injection**

*   **Root Cause:**  Uninitialized `$dir` variables in `skin/zero_vote/login.php`, `skin/zero_vote/setup.php`, `skin/zero_vote/ask_password.php`, and `skin/zero_vote/error.php`. The application directly includes the contents of this variable without validation, leading to PHP code injection.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of variable initialization, usage of `include` with a user-controlled path.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can include remote PHP files from their own servers using the `dir` parameter, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP GET request to the vulnerable scripts with a crafted `dir` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled URL. The php.ini needs to have allow_url_fopen enabled.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server. The PHP setting allow_url_fopen needs to be enabled.

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerabilities are related to insufficient input validation and insecure use of include statements. Vulnerability 1 is a file disclosure vulnerability, while Vulnerabilities 2 and 3 are remote code execution vulnerabilities.
