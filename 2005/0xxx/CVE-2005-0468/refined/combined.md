# USN-224-1: Kerberos vulnerabilities

6 December 2005

Kerberos vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the env\_opt\_add()

function of the Kerberos 4 and 5 telnet clients. By sending specially

crafted replies, a malicious telnet server could exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the

telnet client. ([CVE-2005-0468](/security/CVE-2005-0468))

Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of the

LINEMODE suboptions in the telnet clients of Kerberos 4 and 5. By

sending a specially constructed reply containing a large number of SLC

(Set Local Character) commands, a remote attacker (i. e. a malicious

telnet server) could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of

the user running the telnet client. ([CVE-2005-0469](/security/CVE-2005-0469))

Daniel Wachdorf discovered two remote vulnerabilities in the Key

Distribution Center of Kerberos 5 (krb5-kdc). By sending certain TCP

connection requests, a remote attacker could trigger a double-freeing

of memory, which led to memory corruption and a crash of the KDC

server. ([CVE-2005-1174](/security/CVE-2005-1174)). Under rare circumstances the same type of TCP

connection requests could also trigger a buffer overflow that could be

exploited to run arbitrary code with the privileges of the KDC server.

([CVE-2005-1175](/security/CVE-2005-1175))

Magnus Hagander discovered that the krb5\_recvauth() function attempted

to free previously freed memory in some situations. A remote attacker

could possibly exploit this to run arbitrary code with the privileges

of the program that called this function. Most imporantly, this

affects the following daemons: kpropd (from the krb5-kdc package),

klogind, and kshd (both from the krb5-rsh-server package).

([CVE-2005-1689](/security/CVE-2005-1689))

Please note that these packages are not officially supported by Ubuntu

(they are in the 'universe' component of the archive).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* krb5-rsh-server
  -
* krb5-kdc
  -
* krb5-clients
  -
* krb5-telnetd
  -
* kerberos4kth-clients
  -

##### Ubuntu 4.10

* krb5-rsh-server
  -
* krb5-kdc
  -
* krb5-clients
  -
* krb5-telnetd
  -
* kerberos4kth-clients
  -

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

## Multiple Telnet Clients vulnerable to buffer overflow via the env\_opt\_add() function in telnet.c

#### Vulnerability Note VU#341908

Original Release Date: 2005-04-01 | Last Revised: 2005-07-28

---

### Overview

Multiple Telnet clients contain a data length validation flaw that may allow a malicious server to execute arbitrary code on the client host with privs of client.

### Description

| The Telnet network protocol is described in RFC854 and RFC855 as a general, bi-directional communications facility. The Telnet protocol is commonly used for command-line login sessions between Internet hosts.  Many Telnet clients are vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition. The env\_opt\_add() function of telnet.c contains a 256-byte buffer that may be expanded to 512 bytes if needed. While checks are in place to ensure that the input buffer for this function is within the size allocated, the Telnet protocol may escape characters contained in the input buffer. If the number of characters escaped causes the resulting input to exceed the 512 byte allocated buffer, a heap overflow occurs.Several Telnet clients derived from a variety of lineages are confirmed to be affected. Please review the "Systems Affected" section below, or consult with your vendor to determine if you are affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Exploitation of this vulnerability may permit a malicious server to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user that invoked the telnet client. An attacker would have to trick a victim into initiating a telnet connection using a vulnerable client. This may be accomplished with an HTML rendered email or web page, using the TELNET:// URI handler, however further user interaction may be required. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. |

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : krb5
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CAN-2005-0468 CAN-2005-0469
CERT advisories: VU#341908 VU#291924

Several problems have been discovered in telnet clients that could be
exploited by malicious daemons the client connects to.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CAN-2005-0468

    Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the env_opt_add()
    function that allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

CAN-2005-0469

    Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of the
    LINEMODE suboptions in telnet clients.  This can lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code when connected to a malicious server.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.4-5woody8.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2005-001
Original release: 2005-03-28
Topic: Buffer overflows in telnet client
Severity: serious
SUMMARY
=======
The telnet client program supplied with MIT Kerberos 5 has buffer
overflows in the functions slc\_add\_reply() and env\_opt\_add(), which
may lead to remote code execution.
IMPACT
======
An attacker controlling or impersonating a telnet server may execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the telnet
client. The attacker would need to convince the user to connect to a
malicious server, perhaps by automatically launching the client from a
web page. Additional user interaction may not be required if the
attacker can get the user to view HTML containing an IFRAME tag
containing a "telnet:" URL pointing to a malicious server.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* telnet client programs included with the MIT Kerberos 5
implementation, up to and including release krb5-1.4.
\* Other telnet client programs derived from the BSD telnet
implementation may be vulnerable.
FIXES
=====
\* WORKAROUND: Disable handling of "telnet:" URLs in web browsers,
email readers, etc., or remove execute permissions from the telnet
client program.
\* The upcoming krb5-1.4.1 patch release will contain fixes for this
problem.
\* Apply the patch found at:
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2005-001-patch\_1.4.txt
The associated detached PGP signature is at:
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2005-001-patch\_1.4.txt.asc
The patch was generated against the krb5-1.4 release. It may apply
against earlier releases with some offset.

[IDEF0866] Multiple Telnet Client slc\_add\_reply() Buffer Overflow
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=220&type=vulnerabilities
CVE: CAN-2005-0469
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0469
[IDEF0867] Multiple Telnet Client env\_opt\_add() Buffer Overflow
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=221&type=vulnerabilities
CVE: CAN-2005-0468
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0468
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
Thanks to iDEFENSE for notifying us of these vulnerabilities, and for
providing useful feedback.
DETAILS
=======
The slc\_add\_reply() function in telnet.c performs inadequate length
checking. By sending a carefully crafted telnet LINEMODE suboption
string, a malicious telnet server may cause a telnet client to
overflow a fixed-size data segment or BSS buffer and execute arbitrary
code.
The env\_opt\_add() function in telnet.c performs inadequate length
checking. By sending a carefully crafted telnet NEW-ENVIRON suboption
string, a malicious telnet server may cause a telnet client to
overflow a heap buffer and execute arbitrary code.
