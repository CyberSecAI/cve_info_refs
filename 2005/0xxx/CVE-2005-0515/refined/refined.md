Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2005-0515:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the "Smc.exe" process of Webroot's My Firewall Plus. This process incorrectly invokes the Log Viewer's export functionality, failing to drop SYSTEM privileges before doing so.
*   **Weakness:** Privilege escalation due to the "Smc.exe" process not dropping SYSTEM privileges when invoking the Log Viewer's export functionality. This allows a local user to perform actions they wouldn't normally be able to.
*   **Impact:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability to corrupt arbitrary files on the system by using the logging information export functionality. This could lead to denial of service or other potential issues from file corruption.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local user exploitation.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be a local user on the system with the vulnerable software installed.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Webroot released a patch "MFP\_Patch.exe" to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Secunia.
