The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in eXponent 0.95, specifically cross-site scripting (XSS) and full path disclosure.

**A. Cross-site scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-submitted data in module variables.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   **A1:** Unsanitized user input in the `module` parameter of `index.php` allows injection of arbitrary HTML or Javascript.
    *   **A2:** Similar unsanitized input in `mod.php` via the `module` parameter also results in XSS. The example provided uses a script tag containing `alert(document.cookie)`.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a `module` parameter containing Javascript code.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince a user to click a crafted link.

**B. Full Path disclosures:**

*   **Root cause:** Direct access to specific PHP scripts within the application's subdirectories triggers PHP error messages that expose the full server path of the script. The vulnerability is due to an undefined variable `pathos_core_version` in the mentioned scripts.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Improper error handling and direct access to the mentioned scripts (`.info.php` files and others) reveal the full server path when accessed directly by a user.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker gains knowledge of the server's file system structure, potentially aiding further attacks by identifying sensitive locations.
*   **Attack vectors:** Directly accessing vulnerable files via HTTP requests.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be an unauthenticated user and only needs to access the specific paths.

The content provides more details about the vulnerable code than the official CVE description, specifically detailing the affected parameter (`module`) in specific files (`index.php`, `mod.php`). It also provides specific vulnerable files for the path disclosure vulnerability.
