The provided content details an XSS vulnerability in ASP.NET related to the handling of fullwidth ASCII characters when converting Unicode strings to national ASCII code pages. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass sanitization mechanisms and inject malicious HTML or script code into web pages.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of fullwidth ASCII characters (U+ff00-U+ff60) during the conversion of Unicode strings to national ASCII code pages (e.g., windows-1251, koi-8). ASP.NET does not filter out these characters, which include special HTML characters like '<', '>', and '"'. When a page uses a national ASCII encoding for output, these fullwidth characters are converted to their normal ASCII equivalents, thus introducing unescaped HTML characters that lead to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** ASP.NET fails to filter out special HTML characters within the fullwidth ASCII range during output to national ASCII code pages.
- **Unicode Conversion Issues:** The conversion from Unicode to national ASCII code pages does not properly handle and escape fullwidth ASCII characters.
- **Bypass of Request Validation:** The "Request Validation" mechanism is bypassed by using fullwidth characters that are later converted to special HTML characters.
- **Bypass of HTML Encoding:** The `HttpServerUtility.HtmlEncode` method does not filter fullwidth ASCII characters and therefore fails to prevent XSS when converting to national ASCII code pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages, which will be executed in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacement of websites
    - Executing arbitrary code in the browser
- **Request Validation Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the request validation mechanism, which is intended to prevent cross-site scripting and SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL parameters:** Attackers can inject malicious code through URL parameters (Query Strings).
- **Injected Unicode Characters:** Malicious code can be introduced as fullwidth Unicode characters within strings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ASP.NET application, including crafting URL parameters that contain malicious payloads.
- **Awareness of national codepage:** The attacker needs to be aware that the web application outputs to national ASCII code page.
