- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The bsmtpd application failed to sanitize input addresses, which allowed for the execution of arbitrary commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing input sanitization, leading to arbitrary command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the affected system during mail delivery.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted email addresses to the vulnerable bsmtpd service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a system running a vulnerable version of bsmtpd.
