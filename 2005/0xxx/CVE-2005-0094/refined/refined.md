Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0094:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `gopher.c` file within the Squid proxy cache software. Specifically, the vulnerability is in the code that parses responses from Gopher servers when converting to HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The code uses a fixed-size buffer (`TEMP_BUF_SIZE`) to store data received from a Gopher server. If a Gopher server sends a line longer than this buffer size, a buffer overflow occurs, leading to memory corruption.
   - The fix ensures that the amount of data copied into the buffer does not exceed available space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition. The buffer overflow leads to memory corruption, which typically causes Squid to crash or restart.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the advisory states that arbitrary code execution is not believed to be possible on popular platforms, the possibility is not ruled out, making this a potential risk. This was not confirmed.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Gopher Server:** An attacker can set up a fake Gopher server.
- **Forwarded Requests:** By forwarding requests through a vulnerable Squid proxy to this malicious Gopher server.
- **Crafted Responses:** The malicious Gopher server sends responses with lines longer than the fixed-size buffer, triggering the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send Gopher requests through the vulnerable Squid instance to their malicious Gopher server.
- **Control over Gopher Server:** The attacker needs to have control over a Gopher server and its responses.
- **User Interaction (Indirect):** Users of a Squid proxy could be indirectly targeted by having their requests directed to the malicious Gopher server.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by "infamous41md".
- The fix involves checking the size of incoming Gopher server responses to ensure they don't exceed the buffer size `TEMP_BUF_SIZE`.
- A workaround was suggested by denying all gopher requests via acl, since real gopher servers are rare.
- The affected versions include all Squid versions up to and including 2.5.STABLE7.
- A patch is available at [http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/bugs/squid-2.5.STABLE7-gopher_html_parsing.patch](http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/bugs/squid-2.5.STABLE7-gopher_html_parsing.patch)
