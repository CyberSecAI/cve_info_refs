How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## EMC Legato NetWorker database services use insufficient authentication

#### Vulnerability Note VU#407641

Original Release Date: 2005-08-16 | Last Revised: 2005-10-04

---

### Overview

The EMC Legato NetWorker database services use weak authentication, allowing a remote attacker to gain root access to the server.

### Description

| [EMC Legato NetWorker](http://www.legato.com/products/networker/networker.htm) is a cross-platform backup and recovery application. It is also repackaged by Sun Microsystems as Solstice Backup and [StorEdge Enterprise Backup](http://www.sun.com/storage/software/data_protection/backup/), by FSC as Fujitsu Siemens Computers' NetWorker, by NEC as WebSAM NetWorker Powered by Legato, and by Fujitsu as NetWorker.  **NetWorker database services**At least two of the processes run by a NetWorker server provide database services. The database on a NetWorker server contains system configuration information, including licenses, client configurations, backup schedules, and storage devices. The server database also contains a mechanism for controlling backups remotely.**NetWorker database service authentication and authorization**NetWorker uses a token-based authentication scheme to determine the identity of a user who attempts to access the network databases. After a database client submits its credentials to the server, the server compares the credentials to an administrator list. The server then grants a token to the client that contains information about the client, including whether the client has administrative privileges.**The problem**NetWorker does not perform adequate authentication of the tokens. An attacker can create or modify a token to grant administrative privileges to himself, regardless of whether the attacker is in the administrator list. An attacker with administrative access to the NetWorker databases can gain complete control of a vulnerable NetWorker server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the NetWorker server as root. Once the NetWorker server has been compromised, any NetWorker client machine could in turn be compromised. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch or upgrade**Apply a patch or upgrade, as specified in the [EMC Legato Technical Product Alert](http://www.legato.com/support/websupport/product_alerts/081605_NW_token_authentication.htm).Sun Solstice Backup and StorEdge Enterprise Backup customers should see [Sun Alert 101866](http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-101886-1) for patch availability. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**You may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the ports used by NetWorker (typically TCP and UDP ports 7937-9936). This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. The use of host-based firewalls in addition to network-based firewalls can help restrict access to specific hosts within the network. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. |
