The provided content describes a directory traversal vulnerability in `includer.cgi`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `includer.cgi` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability: The script allows the use of `../` sequences to navigate up the file system hierarchy.
- Lack of input sanitization: The script does not validate the user-supplied filename, leading to the directory traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file disclosure: An attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the query parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `includer.cgi` script.
