How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-020 - Critical

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (890923)

Published: April 12, 2005

**Version:** 1.0

#### Summary

**Who should read this document:** Customers who use Microsoft Windows

**Impact of Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution

**Maximum Severity Rating:** Critical

**Recommendation:** Customers should apply the update immediately.

**Security Update Replacement** This update replaces the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=37180). That update is also a cumulative update.

**Caveats:** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 890923](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/890923) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 890923](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/890923).

This update does include hotfixes that have been released since the release of [MS04-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189) or [MS04-025](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31981) but they will only be installed on systems that need them. Customers who have received hotfixes from Microsoft or from their support providers since the release of [MS04-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189) or [MS04-025](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31981) should review the FAQ âI have received a hotfix from Microsoft or my support provider since the release of MS04-004. Is that hotfix included in this security update?â in the FAQ section for this update to determine how to ensure that the necessary hotfixes are installed. [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 890923](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/890923) also documents this in more detail.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly-discovered, privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3 and Service Pack 4 | Internet Explorer 5.5 Service Pack 2 on Windows ME | Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (All supported operating system versions earlier than Windows Server 2003) | Internet Explorer 6 for Windows Server 2003 | Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP Service Pack 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DHTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-0553](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-0553) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Critical | Critical | Important | Critical |
| URL Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-0554](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-0554) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical |
| Content Advisor Memory Corruption Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-0555](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-0555) | Remote Code Execution | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Aggregate Severity of All Vulnerabilities** |  | **Critical** | **Critical** | **Critical** | **Critical** | **Critical** |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The severity ratings for non x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating versions as follows:

## Vulnerability Details

#### DHTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0553

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles certain DHTML objects. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page. This malicious Web page could allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for DHTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0553:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also try to compromise a Web site and have it display malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/evaluation/security.asp) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=19873) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version in its default configuration.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message or click a link in an e-mail message.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for DHTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0553:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running Active Scripting in these zones.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting. See the âRestrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sitesâ workaround for information about how you can add sites to the Trusted sites zone.

  Alternatively, you can change your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting only. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. Prompting before running Active Scripting controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.
* **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.
* **Install the update that is described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 if you are using Outlook Express 5.5 SP2.**

  Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed.

  Customers who use one or more of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for DHTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0553:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A race condition could occur in Internet Explorer when it processes DHTML objects.

**What are DHTML objects?**

The Dynamic HTML (DHTML) object model allows for more dynamic content on Web pages than HTML. For more information about DHTML, see the [product documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/dhtml_node_entry.asp).

**What is a race condition?**

A [race condition](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) is typically associated with synchronization errors that provide a window of opportunity during which one process can interfere with another potentially introducing a remote code execution vulnerability. Race conditions may for example occur as a result of the relative timing of events in multithreaded operating systems and software. Race conditions are frequently difficult to exploit in predictable ways. For more information about race conditions, see the [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/1c9txz50%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**Why does this race condition cause a vulnerability?**

This race condition could create an environment where a series of specially timed requests could cause the Internet Explorer to perform an unpredictable action. However, because the circumstances that lead to this condition could change every time that the vulnerability is exploited, it may be difficult for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then persuading the user to visit the page or to view the HTML e-mail message. If the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could access information from other Web sites, could access local files on the system, or could cause malicious code to run in the security context of the locally logged on user. The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message or click a link in an e-mail message.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as usersâ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability.

**What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the **Security** tab and on the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* The security level for the Internet zone is set to **High**. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way Internet Explorer synchronizes the threads that are being used to process the specially crafted messages.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### URL Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0554

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles certain URLs. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page. This malicious Web page could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for URL Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0554:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also try to compromise a Web site and have it display malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/evaluation/security.asp) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=19873) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version in its default configuration.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a malicious link that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for URL Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0554:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running Active Scripting in these zones.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  **Note** This workaround provides limited protection and there are known attack vectors that do not rely on Active Scripting.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting.

  Alternatively, you can change your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting only. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**, and then click **OK**.

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for URL Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0554:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process used by Internet Explorer to validate the buffer used when it processes certain URLs.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then persuading the user to visit the page or to view the HTML e-mail message. If the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could access information from other Web sites, could access local files on the system, or could cause malicious code to run in the security context of the locally logged on user. The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a malicious link that is sent in an e-mail message.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as usersâ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Content Advisor Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0555

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles Content Advisor files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Content Advisor file. This malicious Content Advisor file could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message and accepted the installation of the file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Content Advisor Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0555:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also try to compromise a Web site and have it display malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker. A user would then have to click through a series of Content Advisor setup windows for an attack to be successful.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/evaluation/security.asp) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=19873) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version in its default configuration.
  + Use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment this is sent in an e-mail message and then click through a series of Content Advisor setup windows.

#### Workarounds for Content Advisor Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0555:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Do not open or save content rating files (.rat files) that you receive from untrusted sources.**

  This vulnerability could be exploited when a user installs a .rat file. Do not open files that use this file name extension.
* **Help prevent e-mail attacks by blocking content rating files (.rat files).**

  This vulnerability could be exploited when a user installs a .rat file. To help block these files by using Outlook and Outlook Express, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 837388](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/837388) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387). Enterprise customers could consider adding content rating files (.rat files) to the list of unsafe files that are blocked by enterprise gateway e-mail filters.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running Active Scripting in these zones.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting.

  Alternatively, you can change your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting only. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. Prompting before running Active Scripting controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.
* **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.
* **Install the update that is described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 if you are using Outlook Express 5.5 SP2.**

  Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed.

  Customers who use one or more of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process used by Internet Explorer to validate the buffer used when it processes certain Content Advisor content.

**What is the Internet Explorer Content Advisor?**

Internet Explorer Content Advisor allows you to rate the appropriateness of Web content and to control which Web sites your users can visit. This feature is intended to be used to define a more secure environment that help protect your users from content on the Internet that is not appropriate. For more information about the Content Advisor, see the [product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/ie/6/all/reskit/part2/c05ie6rk.mspx).

Microsoft IIS Web server administrators can rate content in support of the Internet Explorer Content Advisor on a Web site by using content ratings. For more information about content ratings, see the [product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/iis/6/all/proddocs/pub_ucr.mspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then persuading the user to visit the page or to view the HTML e-mail message. If the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could access information from other Web sites, could access local files on the system, or could cause malicious code to run in the security context of the locally logged on user. A user would then have to click through a series of Content Advisor setup windows for an attack to be successful.

An attacker could also send a content ratings file (.rat) in e-mail and persuade a user to install it. A user would have to click through a series of Content Advisor setup windows for an attack to be successful.

If the content ratings file on an IIS Web server has been replaced with a malicious content ratings file, an attacker could cause code execution on the Web server. However, the Web server would already have been compromised because the file resides in an area where, by default, only Administrators have write access. This update also addresses this vector.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as usersâ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows Server 2003, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB890923\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 890923 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows XP Service Pack 1 the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system.
If you have not previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

**Note** For more information, see the âI have received a hotfix from Microsoft or my support provider since the release of MS04-004. Is that hotfix included in this security update?â question in the âFrequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security updateâ section of this bulletin. Also, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 890923](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/890923) for more information if you have to apply a hotfix that was released before Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851) on a system that has the [MS05-020](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=43944) update installed.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\KB890923-IE6SP1-20050225.103456

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 890923 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Internet Explorer 5.01 for Windows 2000 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**
To install the Internet Explorer 5.01 version of this update, you must be running one of the following combinations of Internet Explorer and Windows 2000:

* Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3 (version 5.00.3502.1000) on Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 (SP3)
* Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 (version 5.00.3700.1000) on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 (SP4)

**Note:** Versions of Windows and versions of Internet Explorer that are not listed in this article are no longer supported. Although you can install some of the update packages that are described in this article on these unlisted versions of Windows and of Internet Explorer, Microsoft has not tested them to assess whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities. Microsoft has also not tested these versions to confirm that the update that this bulletin describes addresses these vulnerabilities. We recommend that you upgrade to a supported version of Windows and of Internet Explorer, and then install the appropriate update.

The software that is listed has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer URL validation routine contains a buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#756122

Original Release Date: 2005-04-12 | Last Revised: 2005-04-13

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Internet Explorer ([IE](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx)) contains an unspecified vulnerability in the way that it handles certain URLs. The process that checks the URL contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view an HTML document (e.g., a web page or HTML email message), an attacker could execute arbitrary commands or code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could take any action as the user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the user's system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**  Apply a patch as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-020](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS05-020.mspx). Please also note that Microsoft is actively deploying the patches for this vulnerability via [Windows Update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/). |
| --- |

| **Disable Active scripting and ActiveX controls**To protect against this and other IE vulnerabilities, consider disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone as described in the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56). Consider disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Local Machine Zone. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [833633](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/833633) for information about securing the Local Machine Zone and [315933](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315933) for information about displaying the Local Machine Zone (My Computer security zone) on the Security tab in the Internet Options dialog box.Note that disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. Disabling these features in the Local Machine Zone will reduce the functionality of some programs, including the Help and Support Center in Windows XP.**Read and send email in plain text format**Outlook 2003, Outlook 2002 SP1, and Outlook 6 SP1 can be configured to view email messages in text format. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible. Note that reading and sending email in plain text will not necessarily prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.**Do not follow unsolicited links**In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |
