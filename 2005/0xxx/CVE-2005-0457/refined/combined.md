# Opera: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200502-17**

Opera is vulnerable to several vulnerabilities which could result in
information disclosure and facilitate execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/opera** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.54-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.54-r3** |

### Background

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

### Description

Opera contains several vulnerabilities:

* fails to properly validate Content-Type and filename.
* fails to properly validate date: URIs.
* uses kfmclient exec as the Default Application to handle downloaded
  files when integrated with KDE.
* fails to properly control frames.
* uses Sun Java packages insecurely.
* searches an insecure path for plugins.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to:

* execute arbitrary code.
* load a malicious frame in the context of another browser
  session.
* leak information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-7.54-r3"
```

This is exploitable by dropping shared libraries into the directory, which opera will load on stating.  example: $ mkdir -p /var/tmp/portage/opera-7.54-r1/image//opt/opera/lib/opera/plugins $ gcc -shared rpath.c -o /var/tmp/portage/opera-7.54-r1/image//opt/opera/lib/opera/plugins/DO-NOT-LOAD-ME\!\!.so $ opera exploit code now in control! ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-13 12:22:55 UTC  ``` adding this sed to the existing install.sh sed's in src_unpack() fixes it:  "s:\(str_localdirplugin=\).*$:\1/opt/opera/lib/opera/plugins:" ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Heinrich Wendel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-14 04:30:02 UTC  ``` now in portage as 7.54-r3, stable on all previous arches, since it's only a config path fix ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-14 04:35:53 UTC  ``` Should be included in the soon-to-be-released opera GLSA. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-14 11:40:31 UTC  ``` GLSA 200502-17 ``` |  |
