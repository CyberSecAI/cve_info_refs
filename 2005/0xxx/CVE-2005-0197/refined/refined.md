        "details": {
          "root_cause": "A vulnerability exists in Cisco's Internetwork Operating System (IOS) implementation of MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) which allows malformed MPLS packets to cause an affected device to reload.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "Improper handling of malformed MPLS packets."
          ],
           "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker on a local network segment connected to a vulnerable device interface could send a specially crafted MPLS packet to cause the device to reload, leading to a denial-of-service condition. Repeated exploitation could cause a sustained denial-of-service.",
          "attack_vectors": [
            "Sending malformed MPLS packets over the network."
          ],
          "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be on a local network segment connected to a vulnerable device interface and does not require authentication."
