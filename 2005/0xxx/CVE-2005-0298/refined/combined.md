Hi

I have just created a security advisory for the issue I found that is
fixed in Oracle latest security patch. The issue is with abuse of
DIRECTORY objects and can be found here
<http://www.petefinnigan.com/directory_traversal.pdf> - I have also
updated my Oracle security alerts page to link to this advisory and also
those of other researchers who found bugs fixed by the same Oracle
patch. My alerts page is <http://www.petefinnigan.com/alerts.htm> - There
is also some discussion about Oracles new quarterly critical security
patch schedule in my Oracle security weblog <http://www.petefinnigan.com/>
weblog/entries/index.html

Kind regards

Pete

PeteFinnigan.com security advisory –
DIRECTORY OBJECT – Reading outside of the
directory object

Description
Directory objects used in the Oracle database contain the location of a specific operating system
directory. This location can then be used from database packages and functions by accessing the
DIRECTORY objects in various ways. It is possible to abuse directory object.

Risk
Any existing DIRECTORY object that can be accessed presents a potential risk. Read privileges on a
DIRECTORY object are required to exploit this issue.

Workaround
If no directory objects exist that can be accessed then the problem can be minimised. Review existing
directory objects and their access privileges in the database. A good script is
http://www.petefinnigan.com/who_can_access.sql which can be used to ascertain which users can
access directory objects. Revoke read access privileges from these objects and also ensure no users
have DIRECTORY object creation or alteration system privileges.

Patch information
We advise customers of Oracle to apply the patches listed in the CPU – January 2005 advisory as soon
as possible. Please see Metalink document ID 293737.1 at

http://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/ml2_documents.showDocument?p_database_id=NOT
&p_id=293737.1

Patches are available for other components affected by other bugs in this Oracle advisory. See the
Oracle advisory for details.
