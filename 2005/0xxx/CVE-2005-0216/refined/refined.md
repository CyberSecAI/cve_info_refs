Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-0216

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the `formmail.php` file of Woltlab Burning Board Lite. The `userid` parameter is outputted without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the output. The vulnerability also makes session hijacking possible via stolen cookies.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization of the `userid` parameter in `formmail.php`. The application does not filter or encode user-supplied data before displaying it in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unfiltered output of the `userid` parameter.
- The possibility of session hijacking via stolen cookies

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed within the context of a user's browser. This could lead to:
  - Cookie theft, allowing session hijacking.
  - Redirection to malicious websites.
  - Defacement of the website.
  - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafting a malicious URL that contains a script in the `userid` parameter, such as:
    `<http://website/board/formmail.php?userid=1>">&lt;script&gt;document.location.href="<http://www.it-security23.net>";</script x="y`
  - When a user clicks this malicious link, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute the malicious link. This could be via email, forums, or other channels.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges on the targeted system.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
- Woltlab Burning Board Lite versions 1.0.0, 1.0.1e and possibly other versions.
