Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Topic Calendar 1.0.1 for phpBB, as described in the advisory:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application fails to handle specific requests on Microsoft IIS servers, causing it to reveal the server's full file path in the error message.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate error handling and lack of input validation or sanitization when processing crafted URLs with `\` or negative values for the 'd' parameter.
    *  **Attack Vector**: Sending a crafted GET request to `calendar_scheduler.php` with either a backslash at the end of the URL or a negative value for the `d` parameter (e.g., `?d=-1`).
     *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
    *  **Impact:**  Disclosure of the web server's file system path. This information can be used by attackers to plan further attacks.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application directly incorporates user-controlled data (`$start` parameter) into HTML hidden input field without any sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation or sanitization on the `start` parameter which is used to generate HTML.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious URL with a `<script>` tag in the `start` parameter (e.g., `?start=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E`).
    *    **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server and craft a specific URL with malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Patch:**

*   The advisory suggests using `intval()` function to sanitize the `$start` variable at line 85 of `calendar_scheduler.php`, to prevent the XSS issue. This forces the value to an integer thus preventing HTML/script injection.
```php
   <?
   ...
   if ( isset($HTTP_POST_VARS['start']) || isset($HTTP_GET_VARS['start']) )
   {
     $start = isset($HTTP_POST_VARS['start']) ? $HTTP_POST_VARS['start'] :
$HTTP_GET_VARS['start'];
     $start = intval($start)
   }
   ...
   ?>
```
