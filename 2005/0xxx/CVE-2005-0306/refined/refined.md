Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in MercuryBoard 1.1.1:

**1. Full Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of input validation for the `$num` variable in `global.php`. When `$num` is set to 0 (or a non-numerical value), it results in a division by zero error, revealing the full server path.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unhandled division by zero leading to information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, potentially aiding in further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to `index.php` with `n=0`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** None. This is a client-side attack.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of input sanitization/validation for various GET parameters like `s`, `l`, `a`, `t`, `to`, and `re` in `pm.php`, `members.php`, and `index.php`. The code directly uses these parameters without proper escaping before outputting them to the HTML.
*   **Vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-supplied input leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the web page, allowing them to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads in the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Required Capabilities:** None. This is a client-side attack.
*   **Vulnerable files:** `func/pm.php`, `func/members.php` and `index.php`.

**3. SQL Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization for GET parameters (same as XSS) which are used in SQL queries.
*   **Vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-supplied input leading to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to retrieve sensitive information (e.g., user credentials) or modify database records. The specific example given in the report indicates that the attack is not critical because it requires admin login to be successful, as it seems like it's performed within the admin section of the application.
*  **Attack Vector:**  Sending a crafted URL with a malicious SQL payload in vulnerable parameters, similar to XSS.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  An attacker needs to have admin privileges.
*   **Note:** The report suggests that this vulnerability is "non-critical" because it requires administrator privileges for successful exploitation.
