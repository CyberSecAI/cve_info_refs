  "cve": "CVE-2005-0373",
  "description": "Cyrus-SASL contains a remote buffer overflow in the digestmda5.c file. Additionally, under certain conditions it is possible for a local user to exploit a vulnerability in the way the SASL_PATH environment variable is honored (CAN-2004-0884).",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Buffer overflow in digestmd5.c and improper handling of SASL_PATH environment variable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote buffer overflow",
      "Improper handling of environment variables"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code with the Effective ID of the application calling the Cyrus-SASL libraries. Local users may exploit the SASL_PATH vulnerability to potentially gain elevated privileges.",
