# Cyrus-SASL: Buffer overflow and SASL\_PATH vulnerabilities — GLSA **200410-05**

Cyrus-SASL contains two vulnerabilities that might allow an attacker to
completely compromise the vulnerable system.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/cyrus-sasl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.1.18-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.18-r2** |

### Background

Cyrus-SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer.

### Description

Cyrus-SASL contains a remote buffer overflow in the digestmda5.c file.
Additionally, under certain conditions it is possible for a local user
to exploit a vulnerability in the way the SASL\_PATH environment
variable is honored (CAN-2004-0884).

### Impact

An attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code with the Effective
ID of the application calling the Cyrus-SASL libraries.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Cyrus-SASL users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=dev-libs/cyrus-sasl-2.1.18-r2"
 # emerge ">=dev-libs/cyrus-sasl-2.1.18-r2"
```
