Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the improper handling of `javascript:` and `data:` URLs within Live Bookmarks in Firefox. These URLs, when included in a Live Bookmark feed, were not being correctly sanitized, allowing them to execute in the context of the currently viewed page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of URL Sanitization:** Firefox did not properly validate or sanitize URLs used in Live Bookmarks. This allowed malicious actors to inject javascript: or data: URLs.
*   **Context of Execution:**  When a Live Bookmark feed was updated, the included URLs were executed within the security context of the current page. This means if a user had a page with higher privileges open (e.g., `about:config` or `chrome://` URLs) the malicious scripts could have access to those elevated privileges.
*   **Cookie Theft and Data Exposure:**  Due to the execution context, malicious javascript URLs could access cookies or other data displayed on the page, potentially leading to information theft.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In cases where the user had navigated to a page with elevated privileges, the malicious javascript within the live bookmark could execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Stealing:** An attacker could steal session cookies, potentially hijacking user accounts.
*   **Data Theft:** Sensitive data displayed on the page could be stolen.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** On pages with elevated privileges the exploit could result in the execution of arbitrary code on the user's machine, leading to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Live Bookmarks:** An attacker would need to craft an RSS feed containing malicious `javascript:` or `data:` URLs.
*   **User Interaction:** The user would need to subscribe to the malicious RSS feed as a Live Bookmark.
*   **Live Bookmark Update:** When the Live Bookmark feed was updated, the malicious URLs would be executed by Firefox.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious RSS Feeds:** An attacker would need the ability to host or provide a malicious RSS feed with specially crafted URLs.
*   **User Enticement:** The attacker needs to entice the victim to subscribe to the malicious feed. The user must explicitly add the feed as a Live Bookmark.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report indicates that while the vulnerability was initially discovered in the context of Live Bookmarks, it was also found that it also existed when bookmarking manually created malicious URLs.
*   The fix involved using `nsIScriptSecurityManager`'s `CheckLoadURI` method to validate URLs and prevent execution of  `javascript:` or `data:` URLs in the context of the current page, and for any URL loaded via bookmarks.
*   The bug was considered critical, which emphasizes the severity of the issue at the time.
*   The bug was fixed in Firefox 1.0.
