Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the handling of the Gamespy CD-key hash during online server-side authorization within the Painkiller game.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A fixed-size buffer of 100 bytes is used to store the Gamespy CD-key hash, which is normally 72 characters long.
- The application does not properly validate the length of the incoming CD-key hash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By providing a CD-key hash longer than 100 bytes, an attacker can overflow the buffer. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remote and targets the game server.
- The vulnerability is exploited during in-game online server authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted CD-key hash to the server.
- If the server is password-protected, the attacker must know the password.
- The attacker needs to have a copy of the vulnerable game client.
- The attacker must have the ability to connect to a game server running a vulnerable version of Painkiller.

**Additional Details:**
- Only alphanumeric characters are allowed for the overflowed data, limiting some exploitation options.
- The vulnerability affects Painkiller versions 1.35 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.61 of the game.
