## Microsoft Word buffer overflow in font processing routine

#### Vulnerability Note VU#218621

Original Release Date: 2005-07-12 | Last Revised: 2005-07-13

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow in the font processing routine used by Microsoft Word may allow a remote attacker to execute code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Word contains a buffer overflow in the routine that processes fonts. An remote attacker may be able to trigger the buffer overflow by persuading a user to access a Word document containing a specially crafted font.  For more information about affected versions of Microsoft Word, please refer to [MS05-035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-035.mspx). Note that this advisory supplants [MS05-023](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-023.mspx). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a specially-crafted Word document, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user or cause Microsoft Word to terminate. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply An Update** Microsoft has addressed this issue in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-035.mspx).Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-035.mspx) suggests the following workaround:**Do Not Open Word Documents from Unknown or Untrusted Sources**Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted Word document file (typically .doc). By only accessing Word documents from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. |
| --- |

| In addition, to further as a general good security practice:  **Do Not Follow Unsolicited Links**  In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |

#### Workarounds for Font Parsing Vulnerability in Word - CAN-2005-0564:

**Do not open or save Microsoft Word files that you receive from un-trusted sources.**

This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a file.

#### FAQ for Font Parsing Vulnerability in Word - Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0564:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the process used by the affected software to process fonts.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Anyone who could persuade a user to open a specially-crafted document can attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted document to the user and by persuading the user to open the file. If the user opened the file, the affected software could fail and could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Can the vulnerability be exploited automatically through an e-mail message?**

No. A user must open a specially-crafted document that an attacker provided in order for the attacker to attempt to exploit the vulnerability. Viewing an e-mail message, even if Microsoft Word had been selected as the default e-mail editor for Microsoft Outlook, would not expose the vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the affected software validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.
