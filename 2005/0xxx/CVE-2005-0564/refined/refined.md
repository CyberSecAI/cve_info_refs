Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An unchecked buffer exists in the font processing routine of Microsoft Word.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when processing font data, allowing a specially crafted font to overwrite memory buffers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the document.
- Complete System Control: If the user has administrative rights, an attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new user accounts.
- Application Termination: The vulnerability could also cause Microsoft Word to terminate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Word Document: An attacker crafts a document containing a specially crafted font to trigger the buffer overflow.
- Social Engineering: The attacker relies on social engineering to persuade a user to open the malicious document. The document can be distributed via email or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a malicious Word document containing a specially crafted font.
- Ability to deliver the crafted document to a target user and convince the user to open it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is not automatically exploitable through email; the user must open the document.
- The severity of the impact is dependent on the user's privileges; users with fewer rights on the system will be less impacted.
- This vulnerability affects Microsoft Word 2000, 2002 and Microsoft Works Suite.
- Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office Word 2003 Viewer are not affected.
