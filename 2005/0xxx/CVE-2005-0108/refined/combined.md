How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Title			:  Apache mod_auth_radius remote integer overflow
Advisory ID		:  LSS-2005-01-02
Date			:  2005-01-10
Advisory URL:		:  <http://security.lss.hr/en/index.php?page=details&ID=LSS-2005-01-02>
Impact			:  Denial of service attack
Risk level		:  Low
Vulnerability type	:  Remote
Vendors contacted	:  10.12.2004

---

===[ Overview

Mod_auth_radius is RADIUS authentication module for Apache. It allows
any Apache web-server to become a RADIUS client for authentication,
authorization and accounting requests. You will, however, need to supply
your own RADIUS server to perform the actual authentication.
Mod_auth_radius can be downloaded from <http://www.freeradius.org/mod_auth_radius/>.

===[ Vulnerability

When mod_auth_radius authenticate user against remote RADIUS server,
it will send RADIUS packet with RADIUS_ACCESS_REQUEST code. Server
can responde with RADIUS packet with RADIUS_ACCESS_CHALLENGE code.
When mod_auth_radius gets RADIUS_ACCESS_CHALLENGE, with  attribute
code set to RADIUS_STATE, and another attribute code in same packet set
to RADIUS_REPLY_MESSAGE, RADIUS server reply will be copied in local
buffer with function radcpy(). Size of the data that will be copied in
local buffer is taken from 'length' value of packet attribute received
from RADIUS server.

mod_auth_radius.c:
...
#define radcpy(STRING, ATTR) {memcpy(STRING, ATTR->data, ATTR->length - 2);\
                              (STRING)[ATTR->length - 2] = 0;}
...

Before the data is copied with memcpy() RADIUS attribute length is
subtracted by two. If attribute length is 1, after subtract it will be -1,
and memcpy will lead to segfault.
If an attacker can sniff RADIUS request packets (that is vulnerability by
itself), he can spoof RADIUS server replies with attribute length 1 that
will segfault mod_auth_radius.

===[ Affected versions

All mod_auth_radius versions. Tested on 1.5.4 (1.5.7).

===[ Fix

Not available yet.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 659-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
January 26th, 2005                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : libpam-radius-auth
Vulnerability  : information leak, integer underflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-1340 CAN-2005-0108

Two problems have been discovered in the libpam-radius-auth package,
the PAM RADIUS authentication module.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2004-1340

    The Debian package accidently installed its configuration file
    /etc/pam_radius_auth.conf world-readable.  Since it may possibly
    contain secrets all local users are able to read them if the
    administrator hasn't adjusted file permissions.  This problem is
    Debian specific.

CAN-2005-0108

    Leon Juranic discoverd an integer underflow in the mod_auth_radius
    module for Apache which is also present in libpam-radius-auth.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.14-1.3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.16-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-radius-auth package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
