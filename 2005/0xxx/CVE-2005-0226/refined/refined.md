```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A format string vulnerability exists in the `Log_Resolver()` function within `log.c`. Specifically, the function uses user-controlled input as the format string argument to the `syslog()` function.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Format string vulnerability.

- Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ngIRCd process, which is root by default, potentially leading to a remote shell on the target system.

- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered during IDENT lookups when a client connects to the IRC server. The attacker controls part of the logging message via the IDENT response sent to the server which is then passed to syslog().

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable ngIRCd service. They also need to send a crafted response to the IDENT query of the server to exploit the format string bug. The ngIRCd service must be compiled with IDENT support, logging to SYSLOG enabled, and DEBUG logging enabled.
