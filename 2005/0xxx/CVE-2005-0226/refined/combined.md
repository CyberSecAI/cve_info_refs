-------------------------------------------------
No System Group - Advisory #11 - 03/02/05
-------------------------------------------------
Program: ngIRCd
Homepage: <http://arthur.ath.cx/~alex/ngircd/>
Operating System: Linux and Unix-Compatible
Vulnerable Versions: ngIRCd v0.8.2 and prior
Risk: High
Impact: Remote Format String Vulnerability
-------------------------------------------------

- DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------
ngIRCd is a portable IRC daemon written from scratch.
It is easy to configure, supports server links (even
with original ircds) and runs on hosts with changing
IP addresses (such as dial-in networks). Currently
supported platforms are AIX, A/UX, Darwin/Mac OS X,
FreeBSD, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, NetBSD, SunOS/Solaris,
and Windows with Cygwin.

More informations at: <http://arthur.ath.cx/~alex/ngircd/>

- DETAILS
-------------------------------------------------
Exist a format string bug in the Log_Resolver() function
of log.c when parses erroneous arguments to the syslog()
function. This may give a remote shell with privileges of
ngIRCd, it's 'root' by default.

----------- log.c ------------
261:         vsnprintf( msg, MAX_LOG_MSG_LEN, Format, ap );
262:         va_end( ap );
263:
264:         /* Output */
265:         if( NGIRCd_NoDaemon )
266:         {
267:                 /* Output to console */
268:                 fprintf( stdout, "[%d:%d] %s\n", (INT)getpid( ), Level, msg );
269:                 fflush( stdout );
270:         }
271: #ifdef SYSLOG
272:         else syslog( Level, msg );
273: #endif
----------- log.c ------------

Here we can look that exist a format string vulnerability
in 272 line of log.c

- EXPLOIT
-------------------------------------------------
To obtain a successful exploitation, we need that
ngIRCd has been compiled with IDENT, logging to
SYSLOG and DEBUG enabled.

We now will look a part of the code of resolve.c:

----------- resolve.c ------------
96:         /* For sub-process */
97:          pid = fork( );
98:          if( pid > 0 )
99:          {
100:                 /* Main process */
101:                 Log( LOG_DEBUG, "Resolver for %s created (PID %d).", inet_ntoa( \
                Addr->sin_addr ), pid );
102:                 FD_SET( s->pipe[[0]](#0), &Resolver_FDs );
103:                 if( s->pipe[[0]](#0) > Conn_MaxFD ) Conn_MaxFD = s->pipe[[0]](#0);
104:                 s->pid = pid;
105:                 s->stage = 0;
106:                 s->bufpos = 0;
107:                 return s;
108:         }

[...]

230: #ifdef IDENTAUTH
231:         /* Do "IDENT" (aka "AUTH") lookup and write result to parent */
232:         Log_Resolver( LOG_DEBUG, "Doing IDENT lookup on socket %d ...", Sock );
233:         res = ident_id( Sock, 10 );
234:         Log_Resolver( LOG_DEBUG, "Ok, IDENT lookup on socket %d done: \"%s\"", \
                Sock, res ? res : "" );
235:
236:         /* Write IDENT result into pipe to parent */
237:         len = strlen( res ? res : "" );
238:         if( res != NULL ) res[len] = '\n';
239:         len++;
240:         if( (size_t)write( w_fd, res ? res : "\n", len ) != (size_t)len )
241:         {
242:                 Log_Resolver( LOG_CRIT, "Resolver: Can't write to parent \
                (IDENT): %s!", strerror( errno ));
243:                 close( w_fd );
244:         }
245:         free( res );
246: #endif
----------- resolve.c ------------

At 97 lines of resolve.c we can see that is
created a new process with fork() function,
this will allow us to obtain the exact address
of RET of automatic way without ircd dies.
We can see too that this process do IDENT lookup
when a host is connected to the ircd daemon,
and using the vulnerable function for logging
with syslog at 242 lines of this code.

I have written a code exploit that use this
method for obtain a root shell in the target.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
