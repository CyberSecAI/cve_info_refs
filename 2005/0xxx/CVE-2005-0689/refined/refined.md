The provided content discusses a vulnerability in "The Includer" script, which allows for remote command execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Includer script improperly handles user-supplied input in the `includer.cgi` script. Specifically, it allows the injection of shell commands within the parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Remote Command Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The script fails to sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `template` parameter, allowing shell metacharacters to be passed directly to the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via specially crafted GET requests containing shell commands in the `template` parameter or by simply inserting commands in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server running the Includer script.
*   **Basic understanding of web requests and shell commands:**  The attacker should be able to craft HTTP GET requests and understand basic shell commands.
