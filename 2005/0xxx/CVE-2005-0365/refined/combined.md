The `dcopidlng' script in the KDE library package
(kdelibs-3.3.2/dcop/dcopidlng/dcopidlng)
creates temporary files in a unsecure manner.

This bug has been fixed in 32 minutes (!) by Stephan Kulow, the KDE team
leader. Here you can found the official patch:
<http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97608>

Note: This bug has been find by `autospec', the work-in-progress tool used by
the QiLinux team to (semi)automatically create specfiles from tarballs and
update/check rpm packages. It's released under GPL and not QiLinux specific.
The latest release can be found at the URL:

KDE Security Advisory: Konqueror International Domain Name Spoofing
Original Release Date: 20050316
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20050316-2.txt

http://secunia.com/advisories/14162/
1. Systems affected:
All KDE versions in the KDE 3.2.x and KDE 3.3.x series.
2. Overview:
Since version 3.2 KDE and it's webbrowser Konqueror have support
for International Domain Names (IDN). Unfortunately this has
made KDE vulnerable to a phishing technique known as a
Homograph attack.
IDN allows a website to use a wide range of international characters
in its domain name. Unfortunately some of these characters have a
strong resemblance to other characters, so called homographs. This
makes it possible for a website to use a domain name that is
technically different from another well known domain name, but has
no or very little visual differences.
This lack of visual difference can be abused by attackers to
trick users into visiting malicious websites that resemble
a well known and trusted website in order to obtain personal
information such as credit card details.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2005-0237 to this issue.
For KDE 3.4 KDE and the Konqueror webbrowser have adopted a
whitelist of domains for which IDN is safe to use because the
registrar for these domains has implemented anti-homographic
character policies or otherwise limited the available set of
characters to prevent spoofing.
3. Impact:
Users can be tricked into visiting a malicious website that
resembles a well known and trusted website without getting any
visual indication that this website differs from the one the
user was expecting to visit.
4. Solution:
Upgrade to KDE 3.4.
For older versions of KDE Source code patches have been made
available which fix these vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor /
binary package provider for information about how to obtain updated
binary packages.
5. Patch:
A patch for KDE 3.2.x is available from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security\_patches
611bad3cb9ae46ac35b907c7321da7aa post-3.2.3-kdelibs-idn.patch
A patch for KDE 3.3.x is available from

6. Time line and credits:

# KDE dcopidlng: Insecure temporary file creation — GLSA **200503-14**

The dcopidlng script is vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially allowing
a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **kde-base/kdelibs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.3.2-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.3.2-r5**revision >= **3.2.3-r7** |

### Background

KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems. DCOP is KDE's simple IPC/RPC mechanism.
dcopidlng is a DCOP helper script.

### Description

Davide Madrisan has discovered that the dcopidlng script creates
temporary files in a world-writable directory with predictable names.

### Impact

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary
files directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem.
When dcopidlng is executed, this would result in the file being
overwritten with the rights of the user running the utility, which
could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All kdelibs users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose kde-base/kdelibs
```
