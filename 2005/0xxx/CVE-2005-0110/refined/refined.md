Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a bypass in Internet Explorer's (SP2) information bar mechanism, specifically its failure to intercept and block dynamically created iframes with a source pointing to a downloadable file when the iframe creation is triggered by the `onclick` event on the `body` tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Bar Bypass:** Internet Explorer's intended security mechanism, the information bar, is circumvented. The information bar is designed to alert users and require explicit permission before downloading a file.
*   **`onclick` event handling:**  The vulnerability lies in how IE handles the `onclick` event on the `body` tag in conjunction with dynamically created iframes, which allows an attacker to trigger a file download without the user's explicit consent.
*   **Dynamic object creation:** The usage of javascript's `createElement` function to create the iframe dynamically is crucial to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unintended File Download:** An attacker can force a user to download a file without their explicit interaction with a download prompt or link, simply by them clicking anywhere on the page.
*   **Malware Distribution:** This could be exploited to distribute malware or other malicious files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is performed remotely by directing a user to a malicious webpage.
*   **Browser-Based:** The attack is executed through the user's web browser (Internet Explorer).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server Access:** The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage containing the exploit code.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the specific bypass in Internet Explorer.
*   **Ability to Serve Content:** The attacker must be able to serve an HTML file that includes the malicious JavaScript code.
* **Victim using Internet Explorer SP2**

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit relies on the HTML `body` tag's `onclick` event.
*   When the user clicks anywhere on the page, the `onclick` event triggers Javascript code to create an iframe element with a `src` attribute pointing to a downloadable file (e.g., malware.exe).
*   The `document.createElement()` and `document.body.appendChild()` are used for dynamic creation and addition of the iframe to the document.
*   `setTimeout("document.execCommand(\"refresh\")",1000)` is added to trigger a refresh and complete the download
*   Internet Explorer fails to intercept this iframe creation and does not display the information bar.
*   The file is then downloaded silently without any user interaction (besides a click anywhere on the page), bypassing the security mechanism.
