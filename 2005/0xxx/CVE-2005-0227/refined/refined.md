{
  "CVE-2005-0227": {
    "Description": "The PostgreSQL server's LOAD extension allows low privileged users to load arbitrary shared libraries into the server process space, which then executes the library's initialization function with the permissions of the server. This allows local privilege escalation.",
    "Root cause": "The LOAD extension in PostgreSQL allows low-privileged users to load arbitrary shared libraries.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control on the LOAD extension",
       "Unrestricted loading of shared libraries"
    ],
    "Impact": "Privilege escalation to the level of the database user by loading and executing arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access via the LOAD command"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Low-privileged database user able to execute SQL queries, specifically using the LOAD command. On Windows systems, the attacker must be able to setup an anonymous share to host the malicious library. The attacker also requires the ability to create a malicious library."
