NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: RealPlayer 'ShowPreferences' Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Systems Affected: RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1040) and older
Severity: High
Vendor URL: <http://www.real.com/>
Author: John Heasman [ john@ngssoftware.com ]
Date of Public Advisory: 19th January 2004
Advisory number: #NISR19012005e
Advisory URL: <http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/real-01full.txt>
Reference: <http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/real-01.txt>

Description
***********

A vulnerability has been discovered in the RealPlayer ActiveX component
which can allow remote code execution when visiting a specially crafted
webpage or when opening a specially crafted skin file.

Details
*******

The RealPlayer ActiveX component exports a function called HandleAction().
This function is designed to take a method or an action, and to execute it
under a number of differing environments. This could be within a
RealPlayer skin file or a webpage which is designed to interact with
RealPlayer.

One of the 'actions' which HandleAction() will accept is
'ShowPreferences'. This method will accept two arguments, a category and
the url of it's respective webpage.

It has been discovered that passing overly long arguments to this method
will result in an unbounded concatenation of the two arguments into a
stack based buffer through an unchecked call to sprintf().

Fix Information
***************

RealNetworks have released an update for the ShowPreferences buffer
overflow which can be downloaded from:

<http://service.real.com/help/faq/security/040928_player/EN/>

A check for this vulnerability has been added to Typhon III, NGSSoftware's
advanced vulnerability assessment scanner. For more information please

## RealPlayer ActiveX control contains buffer overflow in "ShowPreferences"

#### Vulnerability Note VU#698390

Original Release Date: 2005-01-24 | Last Revised: 2005-01-27

---

### Overview

The RealPlayer ActiveX control contains a stack-based buffer overflow in the ShowPreferences method. This may permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.

### Description

| RealNetworks [RealPlayer](http://www.real.com/) is a multimedia application that allows users to view local and remote audio/video content. The RealPlayer [ActiveX](http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.mspx) control allows web authors to embed the RealPlayer application in HTML documents and have control over it. One of the exported functions of the RealPlayer ActiveX control is [HandleAction](http://service.real.com/help/library/guides/realonescripting/browse/htmfiles/playerme.htm#HandleAction), which executes a method or action. When the HandleAction function is used to call the [ShowPreferences](http://service.real.com/help/library/guides/realonescripting/browse/htmfiles/playerme.htm#102199) method, the RealPlayer preferences dialog is displayed, showing the specified category and page.  The ShowPreferences method concatenates its two arguments and then makes an unchecked call to sprintf(). By passing long arguments to ShowPreferences, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow to occur. Any browser that supports ActiveX may be affected, including IE and other software that uses MSHTML. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view an HTML document (e.g., a web page or HTML email messsage), an attacker could execute arbitrary commands or code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could take any action as the user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the user's system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Install update**Install an update, as specified by the [RealNetworks security advisory](http://service.real.com/help/faq/security/040928_player/EN/). |
| --- |

| **Disable Active scripting and ActiveX controls**To protect against this and other vulnerabilities in ActiveX controls, consider disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone as described in the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56). Note that disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. |
