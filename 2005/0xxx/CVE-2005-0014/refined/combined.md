# ncpfs: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200501-44**

The ncpfs utilities contain multiple flaws, potentially resulting in the
remote execution of arbitrary code or local file access with elevated
privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-fs/ncpfs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.6** |

### Background

ncpfs is a NCP protocol network filesystem driver that allows
access to NetWare services, to mount volumes of NetWare servers or
print to NetWare print queues.

### Description

Erik Sjolund discovered two vulnerabilities in the programs
bundled with ncpfs: there is a potentially exploitable buffer overflow
in ncplogin (CAN-2005-0014), and due to a flaw in nwclient.c, utilities
using the NetWare client functions insecurely access files with
elevated privileges (CAN-2005-0013).

### Impact

The buffer overflow might allow a malicious remote NetWare server
to execute arbitrary code on the NetWare client. Furthermore, a local
attacker may be able to create links and access files with elevated
privileges using SUID ncpfs utilities.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ncpfs users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/ncpfs-2.2.6"
```
