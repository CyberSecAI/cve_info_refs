How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**I am still using Windows XP, but extended security update support ended on September 30th, 2004. What should I do?**

The original version of Windows XP, generally known as Windows XP Gold or Windows XP Release to Manufacturing (RTM) version, reached the end of its extended security update support life cycle on September 30, 2004.

It should be a priority for customers who have this operating system version to migrate to supported operating system versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Service Pack Product Lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifesupsps). For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine whether this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date by using MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2.1 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 1.2.1 Q&A; Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33332).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158). The Security Update Inventory Tool is required for detecting Microsoft Windows and other affected Microsoft products. For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460)

## Vulnerability Details

#### Named Pipe Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0051:

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely read the user names for users who have an open connection to an available shared resource.

#### Mitigating Factors for Named Pipe Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0051:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* Stopping or disabling the Computer Browser service and then restarting the affected system mitigates this vulnerability. The information disclosure does not happen if this service is stopped or disabled. By default, the Computer Browser service is not running on Windows XP Service Pack 2. Windows XP Service Pack 2 systems that are members of a domain have the Computer Browser disabled. By default, on Windows XP Service Pack 2 systems, that are not members of a domain, the Windows Firewall is enabled and the Computer Browser does not start. If the Windows Firewall is disabled or if File and Printer sharing is enabled, the Computer Browser service will start successfully and the system could be vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for Named Pipe Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0051:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable the Computer Browser service**

  Disabling the Computer Browser service and restarting the affected system will help protect from remote attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  You can disable the Computer Browser service by following these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel** (or point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**).
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Computer Browser Service**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.
  7. You must restart the affected system for this workaround to correction function.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If the Computer Browser service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Computer Browser service may log an error message in the system event log. For more information about the Computer Browser service, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 188001](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/188001).
* **Use the Group Policy settings to disable Computer Browser service on all affected systems that do not require this feature.**

  Because the Computer Browser service is a possible attack vector, disable it by using the Group Policy settings. You can disable the startup of this service at the local, site, domain, or organizational unit level by using Group Policy object functionality in Windows 2000 domain environments or in Windows Server 2003 domain environments.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If the Computer Browser service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Computer Browser service may log an error message in the system event log. For more information about the Computer Browser service, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 188001](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/188001).
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall:**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected protocol. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about the ports, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **Use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and do not enable âFile and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networksâ.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet. If you have enabled âFile and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networksâ this option will create an exception to allow communication on the affected ports and would still allow a system to be vulnerable to this issue even with the Internet Connection Firewall enabled. The âFile and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networksâ exception should be removed to help protect against this vulnerability.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click to deselect **âFile and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networksâ**.
  5. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  6. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798). While this documentation references Windows 2000, it also applies to Windows XP.
* **Block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878). While this documentation references Windows 2000, it also applies to Windows XP.

#### FAQ for Named Pipe Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0051:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely read the user names of users who have an open connection to a shared resource. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce useful information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process that is used by the affected software to validate authentication information when a client establishes an anonymous logon by using a named pipe connection.

**What is a named pipe?**

Named pipes can be used to provide communication between processes on the same computer or between processes on different computers across a network. Typical named pipe resources include file shares and print shares. For more information about named pipes, visit the following [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa365590).

**How do I know if I use the Computer Browser service on my server?**

By default, the Computer Browser service is installed and running on Windows XP Service Pack 1. By default, the Computer Browser service is disabled on Windows XP Service Pack 2. You can determine if the Computer Browser service is installed by following this procedure.

To verify the Computer Browser service:

1. Click **Start**, click **Programs**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Services**.
2. Verify that the Computer Browser service is present.
3. If the Computer Browser service is running, follow the instructions in the âWorkaroundsâ section of this security bulletin to disable the service.

## Microsoft Windows XP named pipe fails to restrict anonymous access

#### Vulnerability Note VU#939074

Original Release Date: 2005-02-09 | Last Revised: 2005-02-10

---

### Overview

The Server service running on Microsoft Windows XP leaks authentication information.

### Description

| The Server service (srvsvc.dll) is a component of the Server Message Block (SMB), and its follow-on, [Common Internet File System](http://www.microsoft.com/mind/1196/cifs.asp) (CIFS). These are network protocols that Windows uses to share files, printers, serial ports, and communicate between computers. If the Server service is running on Microsoft Windows XP, a remote attacker may be able to access it anonymously via a named pipe. In addition, if that attacker supplies the service with a specially crafted message, they will receive a response that may allow them to determine what other users are accessing a shared resource.  This vulnerability affects Microsoft Windows XP SP 1, Windows XP SP 2, and Windows XP 64-Bit Edition SP 1. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to access authentication information for users running Microsoft Windows XP. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch** Microsoft has released Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-007](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-007.mspx) to address this issue. |
| --- |

| Disable the Computer Browser Service Disabling the Computer service and restarting the affected system will help protect from remote attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Please see [MS05-007](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-007.mspx) for details on how to disable the Computer Browser service. |
