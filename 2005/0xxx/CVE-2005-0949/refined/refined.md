Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2005-0949:** This CVE ID is associated with multiple SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities found in PortalApp, a product by AspApp.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries. Specifically, the `banner_id` parameter in `ad_click.asp` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **XSS:** The application does not sanitize user inputs before displaying them in the page. The `contenttype` and `keywords` parameters in `content.asp` are vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Lack of proper input sanitization for SQL queries leads to injection vulnerabilities.
*   **XSS:** Lack of output encoding when displaying user-controlled data leads to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database, which could lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or even complete database compromise.
*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web pages, allowing them to steal user cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerable parameter `banner_id` in the `ad_click.asp` script.  Attackers can inject SQL commands into the URL parameter.
*   **XSS:** The vulnerable parameters `contenttype` and `keywords` in the `content.asp` script. Attackers inject malicious Javascript into URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the application via HTTP and manipulate URL parameters. They do not require any prior knowledge of the application beyond the vulnerability locations and the relevant HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The provided proof-of-concept shows that injecting `'SQL_INJECTION` into the `banner_id` parameter causes a database error indicating a SQL syntax error, confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **XSS:** The provided proof-of-concept shows that injecting `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` into the `contenttype` and `keywords` parameters results in a JavaScript alert popping up on the page, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
* The advisory suggests using `htmlspeacialchars()`, `mysql_escape_string()` or `mysql_real_escape_string()` for input validation.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was reported by Diabolic Crab on March 30, 2005.
* The advisory suggests that the usage of appropriate sanitization functions would solve the issue.
