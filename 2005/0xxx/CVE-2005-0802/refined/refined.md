Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-0802

**Vulnerability Description:** The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the ACS Blog (ASP Weblog System).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `/search.asp` page not properly sanitizing user-supplied input. Specifically, the `search` parameter is vulnerable to injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a user viewing the vulnerable page. This can lead to a wide range of attacks including session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious websites, and data theft.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can alter the appearance of the website for users.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker can redirect the users to a phishing site for credential theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `search` parameter of the `/search.asp` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated and can initiate the attack remotely.
*   **Ability to craft malicious URL:** The attacker needs the ability to craft the malicious URL containing the XSS payload.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
*   ACS Blog v0.8
*   ACS Blog v0.9
*   ACS Blog v1.0
*   ACS Blog v1.1b

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability is triggered using the following URL or equivalent:
```
/search.asp?search=%22%3Cbr%3E%3Ciframe+src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com%22%3E%3C%2Fiframe%3E
```
or the following code:
```
<br><iframe src="<http://google.com>"></iframe>
```
inserted into the `search` field.

This injects an iframe element into the search page, which can then be leveraged for various XSS attacks.
