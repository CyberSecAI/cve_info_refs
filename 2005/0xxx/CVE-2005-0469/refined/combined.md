# netkit-telnetd: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200503-36**

The netkit-telnetd telnet client is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, which
could allow a malicious telnet server operator to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/netkit-telnetd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.17-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.17-r6** |

### Background

netkit-telnetd provides standard Linux telnet client and server.

### Description

A buffer overflow has been identified in the slc\_add\_reply()
function of netkit-telnetd client, where a large number of SLC commands
can overflow a fixed size buffer.

### Impact

Successful explotation would require a vulnerable user to connect
to an attacker-controlled host using telnet, potentially executing
arbitrary code with the permissions of the telnet user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All netkit-telnetd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/netkit-telnetd-0.17-r6"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2005-001
Original release: 2005-03-28
Topic: Buffer overflows in telnet client
Severity: serious
SUMMARY
=======
The telnet client program supplied with MIT Kerberos 5 has buffer
overflows in the functions slc\_add\_reply() and env\_opt\_add(), which
may lead to remote code execution.
IMPACT
======
An attacker controlling or impersonating a telnet server may execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the telnet
client. The attacker would need to convince the user to connect to a
malicious server, perhaps by automatically launching the client from a
web page. Additional user interaction may not be required if the
attacker can get the user to view HTML containing an IFRAME tag
containing a "telnet:" URL pointing to a malicious server.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* telnet client programs included with the MIT Kerberos 5
implementation, up to and including release krb5-1.4.
\* Other telnet client programs derived from the BSD telnet
implementation may be vulnerable.
FIXES
=====
\* WORKAROUND: Disable handling of "telnet:" URLs in web browsers,
email readers, etc., or remove execute permissions from the telnet
client program.
\* The upcoming krb5-1.4.1 patch release will contain fixes for this
problem.
\* Apply the patch found at:
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2005-001-patch\_1.4.txt
The associated detached PGP signature is at:
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2005-001-patch\_1.4.txt.asc
The patch was generated against the krb5-1.4 release. It may apply
against earlier releases with some offset.

[IDEF0866] Multiple Telnet Client slc\_add\_reply() Buffer Overflow
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=220&type=vulnerabilities
CVE: CAN-2005-0469
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0469
[IDEF0867] Multiple Telnet Client env\_opt\_add() Buffer Overflow
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=221&type=vulnerabilities
CVE: CAN-2005-0468
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0468
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
Thanks to iDEFENSE for notifying us of these vulnerabilities, and for
providing useful feedback.
DETAILS
=======
The slc\_add\_reply() function in telnet.c performs inadequate length
checking. By sending a carefully crafted telnet LINEMODE suboption
string, a malicious telnet server may cause a telnet client to
overflow a fixed-size data segment or BSS buffer and execute arbitrary
code.
The env\_opt\_add() function in telnet.c performs inadequate length
checking. By sending a carefully crafted telnet NEW-ENVIRON suboption
string, a malicious telnet server may cause a telnet client to
overflow a heap buffer and execute arbitrary code.

Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CAN-2005-0468 CAN-2005-0469
CERT advisories: VU#341908 VU#291924

Several problems have been discovered in telnet clients that could be
exploited by malicious daemons the client connects to.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CAN-2005-0468

    Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the env_opt_add()
    function that allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

CAN-2005-0469

    Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of the
    LINEMODE suboptions in telnet clients.  This can lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code when connected to a malicious server.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.4-5woody8.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 package.

Original Release Date: 2005-03-29 | Last Revised: 2005-12-22

---

### Overview

Multiple Telnet clients contain a data length validation flaw which may allow a server to induce arbitrary code execution on the client host.

### Description

| The Telnet network protocol is described in RFC854 and RFC855 as a general, bi-directional communications facility. The Telnet protocol is commonly used for command line login sessions between Internet hosts.  Many Telnet client implementations may be vulnerable to a flaw which may allow arbitrary code to be executed on the connected client. The Telnet server may supply a specially crafted reply containing a larger number of RFC1184 LINEMODE "Set Local Character" (SLC) suboption commands, which are not checked for proper length before being stored into a fixed length buffer. Affected Telnet clients possibly include the BSD Telnet implementation and the MIT Kerberos distribution.The Telnet LINEMODE mode is enabled by default in a majority of modern Telnet clients and servers, and is often negotiated automatically before user input is required. Therefore, an attacker may be able to launch a vulnerable client, for example, through commands embedded in web pages such as an IFRAME with a "telnet:" URL, and exploit this flaw requiring only minimal or no user interaction. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote server may be able to execute arbitrary code under the permissions of the user running the Telnet client on the local host. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update from your vendor**Patches, updates, and fixes are available from multiple vendors. |
| --- |

| As a workaround, the client may explicitly disable the LINEMODE mode before connecting in order to prevent LINEMODE command processing. In addition, as a best practice clients should never connect to unknown servers. |

# USN-224-1: Kerberos vulnerabilities

6 December 2005

Kerberos vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the env\_opt\_add()

function of the Kerberos 4 and 5 telnet clients. By sending specially

crafted replies, a malicious telnet server could exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the

telnet client. ([CVE-2005-0468](/security/CVE-2005-0468))

Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of the

LINEMODE suboptions in the telnet clients of Kerberos 4 and 5. By

sending a specially constructed reply containing a large number of SLC

(Set Local Character) commands, a remote attacker (i. e. a malicious

telnet server) could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of

the user running the telnet client. ([CVE-2005-0469](/security/CVE-2005-0469))

Daniel Wachdorf discovered two remote vulnerabilities in the Key

Distribution Center of Kerberos 5 (krb5-kdc). By sending certain TCP

connection requests, a remote attacker could trigger a double-freeing

of memory, which led to memory corruption and a crash of the KDC

server. ([CVE-2005-1174](/security/CVE-2005-1174)). Under rare circumstances the same type of TCP

connection requests could also trigger a buffer overflow that could be

exploited to run arbitrary code with the privileges of the KDC server.

([CVE-2005-1175](/security/CVE-2005-1175))

Magnus Hagander discovered that the krb5\_recvauth() function attempted

to free previously freed memory in some situations. A remote attacker

could possibly exploit this to run arbitrary code with the privileges

of the program that called this function. Most imporantly, this

affects the following daemons: kpropd (from the krb5-kdc package),

klogind, and kshd (both from the krb5-rsh-server package).

([CVE-2005-1689](/security/CVE-2005-1689))

Please note that these packages are not officially supported by Ubuntu

(they are in the 'universe' component of the archive).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* krb5-rsh-server
  -
* krb5-kdc
  -
* krb5-clients
  -
* krb5-telnetd
  -
* kerberos4kth-clients
  -

##### Ubuntu 4.10

* krb5-rsh-server
  -
* krb5-kdc
  -
* krb5-clients
  -
* krb5-telnetd
  -

Package        : netkit-telnet
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0469

iDEFENSE researchers discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of
the LINEMODE suboptions in telnet clients.  This can lead to the
execution of arbitrary code when connected to a malicious server.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
