{
  "CVE-2005-0469": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `slc_add_reply()` function of the `netkit-telnetd` client.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `slc_add_reply()` function does not perform adequate length checks when handling SLC commands within a telnet LINEMODE suboption string. This allows a malicious telnet server to send a large number of these commands, overflowing a fixed-size buffer.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a malicious telnet server to execute arbitrary code on the client machine, with the privileges of the telnet client user.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious telnet server sends a carefully crafted telnet LINEMODE suboption string containing a large number of SLC commands.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or impersonate a telnet server and convince the victim to connect to this server. This might be done by having a user connect to the server directly or by automatically launching the client from a web page via a `telnet:` URL. Minimal or no user interaction may be required."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Buffer overflow in the handling of the LINEMODE suboptions in telnet clients.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Inadequate length checking in the `slc_add_reply()` function, leading to a buffer overflow when a large number of SLC commands are sent.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Execution of arbitrary code on the client machine with the privileges of the telnet client user.",
        "Attack vectors": "A malicious telnet server sends a specially crafted reply containing a large number of RFC1184 LINEMODE 'Set Local Character' (SLC) suboption commands.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker controls or impersonates a telnet server."
