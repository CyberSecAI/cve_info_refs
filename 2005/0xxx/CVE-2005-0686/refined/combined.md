# mlterm: Integer overflow vulnerability — GLSA **200503-13**

mlterm is vulnerable to an integer overflow, which could potentially allow
the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-terms/mlterm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.9.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.9.2** |

### Background

mlterm is a multi-lingual terminal emulator.

### Description

mlterm is vulnerable to an integer overflow that can be triggered by
specifying a large image file as a background. This only effects users
that have compiled mlterm with the 'gtk' USE flag, which enables
gdk-pixbuf support.

### Impact

An attacker can create a specially-crafted image file which, when used
as a background by the victim, can lead to the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running mlterm.

### Workaround

Re-compile mlterm without the 'gtk' USE flag.

### Resolution

All mlterm users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/mlterm-2.9.2"
```
