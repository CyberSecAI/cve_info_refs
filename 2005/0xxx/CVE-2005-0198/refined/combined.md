## UW-imapd fails to properly authenticate users when using CRAM-MD5

#### Vulnerability Note VU#702777

Original Release Date: 2005-01-27 | Last Revised: 2005-04-28

---

### Overview

A vulnerablility in an authentication method for the University of Washington IMAP server could allow a remote attacker to access any user's mailbox.

### Description

| The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a method of accessing electronic messages kept on a remote mail server and is specified in [RFC3501](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3501.txt). The [University of Washington IMAP server](http://www.washington.edu/imap/) features multiple user authentication methods, including the Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism with MD5 (CRAM-MD5) as defined by [RFC2195](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2195.txt). A logic error in the code that handles CRAM-MD5 incorrectly specifies the conditions of successful authentication. This error results in a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to successfully authenticate as any user on the target system. This vulnerability only affects sites that have explicitly enabled CRAM-MD5 style authentication; it is not enabled in the default configuration of the UW-IMAP server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could authenticate as any user on the target system and thereby read and delete email in the authorized user's account. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or apply a patch**  Fixed versions of the software have been released to address this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## UW-imapd fails to properly authenticate users when using CRAM-MD5

#### Vulnerability Note VU#702777

Original Release Date: 2005-01-27 | Last Revised: 2005-04-28

---

### Overview

A vulnerablility in an authentication method for the University of Washington IMAP server could allow a remote attacker to access any user's mailbox.

### Description

| The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a method of accessing electronic messages kept on a remote mail server and is specified in [RFC3501](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3501.txt). The [University of Washington IMAP server](http://www.washington.edu/imap/) features multiple user authentication methods, including the Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism with MD5 (CRAM-MD5) as defined by [RFC2195](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2195.txt). A logic error in the code that handles CRAM-MD5 incorrectly specifies the conditions of successful authentication. This error results in a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to successfully authenticate as any user on the target system. This vulnerability only affects sites that have explicitly enabled CRAM-MD5 style authentication; it is not enabled in the default configuration of the UW-IMAP server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could authenticate as any user on the target system and thereby read and delete email in the authorized user's account. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or apply a patch**  Fixed versions of the software have been released to address this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. |

## UW-imapd fails to properly authenticate users when using CRAM-MD5

#### Vulnerability Note VU#702777

Original Release Date: 2005-01-27 | Last Revised: 2005-04-28

---

### Overview

A vulnerablility in an authentication method for the University of Washington IMAP server could allow a remote attacker to access any user's mailbox.

### Description

| The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a method of accessing electronic messages kept on a remote mail server and is specified in [RFC3501](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3501.txt). The [University of Washington IMAP server](http://www.washington.edu/imap/) features multiple user authentication methods, including the Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism with MD5 (CRAM-MD5) as defined by [RFC2195](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2195.txt). A logic error in the code that handles CRAM-MD5 incorrectly specifies the conditions of successful authentication. This error results in a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to successfully authenticate as any user on the target system. This vulnerability only affects sites that have explicitly enabled CRAM-MD5 style authentication; it is not enabled in the default configuration of the UW-IMAP server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could authenticate as any user on the target system and thereby read and delete email in the authorized user's account. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or apply a patch**  Fixed versions of the software have been released to address this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. |

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
