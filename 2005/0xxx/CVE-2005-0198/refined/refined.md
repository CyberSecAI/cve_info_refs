{
  "CVE-2005-0198": {
    "Description": "A logic error in the code that handles CRAM-MD5 incorrectly specifies the conditions of successful authentication in the University of Washington IMAP server. This error results in a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to successfully authenticate as any user on the target system. This vulnerability only affects sites that have explicitly enabled CRAM-MD5 style authentication; it is not enabled in the default configuration of the UW-IMAP server.",
    "Root cause": "Logic error in the CRAM-MD5 authentication handling code.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect specification of conditions for successful authentication in CRAM-MD5 handling code."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could authenticate as any user on the target system and thereby read and delete email in the authorized user's account.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via the IMAP protocol using CRAM-MD5 authentication."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to connect to the IMAP service",
      "Knowledge of the target system's domain.",
        "Ability to send crafted authentication requests."
    ],
    "Affected software": "University of Washington IMAP server versions prior to 2004b when CRAM-MD5 authentication is enabled."
  }
