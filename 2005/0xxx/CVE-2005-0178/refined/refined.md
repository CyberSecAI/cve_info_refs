Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2005-0178:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A race condition was found in the terminal handling of the `setsid()` function. The `setsid()` function is used to start new process sessions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition in terminal handling during the execution of `setsid()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided information only states that a race condition exists, it doesn't specify the impact of successful exploitation. The context implies this could lead to a crash, instability or other undefined behavior related to process session management.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation involves triggering the race condition during the execution of the `setsid()` function within the kernel's terminal handling code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to execute the `setsid()` system call. It doesn't explicitly state if a local or remote context is required.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided information is more detailed than the original CVE description (which is a placeholder), by including the root cause and vulnerable function `setsid()`.
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions prior to the fix in the Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-82-1) affecting multiple architectures, including i386, amd64 and powerpc.
