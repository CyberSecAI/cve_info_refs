HPSBTU01109     REVISION: 0

SSRT4891 rev.0 - HP Tru64 UNIX message queue,
                 local Denial of Service (DoS)

NOTICE:
There are no restrictions for distribution of this Security
Bulletin provided that it remains complete and intact.

The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon
as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:
08 March 2005

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:
Local  Denial of Service (DoS)

SOURCE:
Hewlett-Packard Company
HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
There is a potential security vulnerability on HP Tru64 UNIX
systems message queue where a local unpriviledged user may cause
a local Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability may impact
processes such as nfsstat, pfstat, arp, ogated, rarpd, route,
sendmail, srconfig, strsetup, trpt, netstat, and xntpd.

REFERENCES:
None

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP Tru64 Unix V5.1B-2/PK4
HP Tru64 Unix V5.1B-1/PK3
HP Tru64 Unix V5.1A PK6
HP Tru64 Unix V4.0G PK4
HP Tru64 Unix V4.0F PK8

BACKGROUND:

RESOLUTION:
Until the message queue corrections are available in a mainstream
version of Tru64 Unix, HP is releasing the following Early
Release Patch (ERP) kits publicly for use by any customer.

The Tru64 Unix ERP kits use dupatch to install and will not
install over any installed Customer Specific Patches (CSPs) that
have file intersections with the ERPs.  Contact your service
provider for assistance if the ERP installation is blocked by any
of your installed CSPs.

The fixes contained in the ERP kits are scheduled to be available
in the following mainstream version:

    Tru64 Unix 5.1B-3/PK5

ERPs are available for the following versions, which provide a
patched version of "std_kern.mod":

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
