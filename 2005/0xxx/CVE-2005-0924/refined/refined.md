The provided content describes a stored/persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in E-Data 2.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application has user-supplied input fields in both the search functionality and the "add to database" function, which do not properly sanitize input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored/Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious scripts can be injected into the database, which are then executed in the browsers of users who interact with the affected part of the application. This can lead to:
    -  Session hijacking,
    -  Phishing attacks,
    -  Malware distribution,
    -  Defacement of the website, or other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
-  By entering malicious JavaScript code into the search or "add to database" input fields.
- The vulnerability is triggered when other users search for the malicious keyword or otherwise interact with the stored malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide input to the affected fields within the E-Data application.
- No special privileges are required.
