|  | |

Even if you have the pref (network.cookie.disableCookieForMailNews) set,
mailnews still allows cookies.
This is because MOZ\_MAIL\_NEWS is not defined in cpp files. And the code to check
if cookies are from mailnews is inside #ifdef MOZ\_MAIL\_NEWS blocks. So the
blocks are not compiled. (checked by adding garbage in the blocks, and gcc
didn't complain about it. And i do have mailnews enabled)
A solution would be to do like
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/calendar/libxpical/Makefile.in#86> but
that looks like a hack.
Filing in cookies, because that is where the code lives.

Unfortunately thunderbird still uses cookies. See following bug, mscott hasn't
ok'ed the patch yet.

A belated comment here. Thunderbird doesn't build the cookies directory (we
don't list cookies in our list of extensions in mail\mozconfig) so we don't
build anything in this directory. As such I wouldn't think we would need this
patch for the Thunderbird branch.
Then again I'm constantly getting myself confused on the cookies issue with
Thunderbird :)

the cookie backend resides in necko now, so if you build necko, you build cookies ;)
unless you specify the --disable-cookies build option I provided.

|  | |

just to clarify that: while thunderbird builds the cookie backend, you're right
that it doesn't build the seamonkey-mailnews pref code that lives in
extensions/cookie, making this patch irrelevant.
for tbird, it's still possible to disable cookies at runtime by using the
network.cookie.cookieBehavior pref. (the default for this is still 'use p3p'.)

Does this mean that setting network.cookie.disableCookieForMailNews to true
(which it is for thunderbid on the branch and trunk)has no effect at all
anymore? And we have to set network.cookie.cookieBehavior to 2 to really disable
cookies at run time?
/me smells a respin coming....

Correct. Thunderbird doesn't build the code that deals with those prefs (in
ext/cookie), so it gets only the barebones GRE-oriented prefs.
If you want finer control over cookies than just enable/disable, the way to do
it is to roll your own nsICookiePermission impl - that's the code that lives in
ext/cookie. (For instance, allowing only for RSS fu, or whatever). If you'd like
to do that, we can help... send me a mail if you want to get in touch over aim.

thanks for explaining all that Dan. I think we just want to set the pref right
now for the respin and then consider either your disable-cookies patch or adding
our own implementation so we could potentially allow cookies for RSS messages on
the trunk.

steps to QA (seamonkey mailnews), thanks to mvl for help:
send yourself an html mail of the following source:
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Set-Cookie" content="feedme=1;max-age=1000">
</head>
<body>
hi!
</body>
</html>
set your network.cookie.disableCookieForMailNews pref to false (e.g. edit pref
file), open mailnews, view mail (in 'original html' mode), close mailnews, check
if the cookie is set in your cookies.txt file (profile directory). it should be.
delete cookies.txt, set the pref to true, and repeat - should be no cookie (in
fact no cookies.txt since you deleted it).
i've confirmed this works with tbird now, just using the "disable cookies" pref,
but this is different to the mailnews case.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-11

## Mail responds to cookie requests

Announced
January 21, 2005
Reporter
Michiel van Leeuwen
Impact
High
Products
Mozilla Suite, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Mozilla Suite 1.7.5
* Thunderbird 1

Vulnerable

* Thunderbird 0.6 - 0.9
* Mozilla Suite 1.7 - 1.7.3

### Description

Mozilla mail clients from March to December 2004 responded to cookie
requests accompanying content loaded over HTTP, ignoring the setting
of the preference "network.cookie.disableCookieForMailNews" (disabled
cookies are the default in mail).

Cookies in mail (for example, spam) could be used to track people.

### Workaround

Set the mail client not to load remote content at all (the default
setting in Thunderbird, the "View as Simple text" option in the Mozilla Suite).
Upgrade to the fixed version

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
