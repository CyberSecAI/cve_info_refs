- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow occurs when a client handles a large player nickname received from the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: 
    - Remote client crash if the attacker controls the server.
    - Client crash if the attacker joins the server with a long nickname.
    - Server crash when running in game mode (acting as both server and client) when an attacker with a long nickname joins.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Attacker controlling a malicious server sending a large nickname to clients.
    - Attacker joining a server with an oversized player name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - To remotely crash clients, an attacker needs to control the game server.
    - To crash clients (and servers in game mode), the attacker needs to join the targeted server.
