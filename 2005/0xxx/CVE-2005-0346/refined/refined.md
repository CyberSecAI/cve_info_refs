- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SafeNet SoftRemote VPN client stores the pre-shared key (password) unencrypted in the process memory (specifically, in the `IreIKE.exe` process).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cleartext storage of sensitive data (pre-shared key) in memory.
    - Obfuscated password stored in the registry can be used to retrieve the plaintext password via the client.
    - Other VPN configuration details (username, IP addresses) stored unencrypted in the registry and policy files.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker with access to the system can retrieve the plaintext VPN password by dumping the process memory (e.g., using PMDump or a physical memory dump after a crash).
    - An attacker with access to the obfuscated password in the registry or policy file can use the VPN client to obtain the plaintext password.
    - An attacker can obtain all the information necessary to access the VPN (username, password, IP addresses) from the client system or policy file.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local access to the system running the VPN client.
    - Access to the registry or policy files where configuration data is stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to dump process memory (using tools like PMDump).
    - Physical access to the machine to induce a memory dump.
    - Access to the machine's registry or VPN policy files.
