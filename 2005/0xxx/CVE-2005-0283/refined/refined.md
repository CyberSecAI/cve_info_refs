{
  "Root cause": "The QWikiwiki application does not properly validate the 'page' parameter, allowing directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Directory traversal vulnerability",
    "Lack of input validation on the 'page' parameter"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the webserver has access to, including configuration files containing sensitive information like administrator passwords.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with a modified 'page' parameter containing directory traversal sequences (../) and a null byte (%00), an attacker can bypass intended access restrictions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable QWikiwiki instance, typically requiring network access."
