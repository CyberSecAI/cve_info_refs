Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2005-0245:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the PL/PgSQL parser of PostgreSQL. This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling input data, specifically related to refcursor declarations.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow, where the program writes data beyond the allocated memory buffer. In this specific case, the vulnerability occurs when processing parameters of a refcursor declaration if more than 1024 parameters are specified.
*   **Insufficient Bounds Checking:** The PL/PgSQL parser lacks proper checks to ensure that the input data does not exceed the buffer size allocated to store refcursor parameters.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of these buffer overflows can lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the PostgreSQL server process. This allows an attacker to potentially gain full control of the database server and compromise the system.
*  **Server Crash:** The buffer overflow can also cause the PostgreSQL server to crash, leading to denial of service.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **PL/PgSQL Parser:** The attack vector is through the PL/PgSQL parser. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious SQL statements or stored procedures involving refcursor declarations with more than 1024 parameters.
*   **Database User:** Any user with the ability to execute SQL commands, including the creation of procedures in PL/PgSQL, could exploit this vulnerability.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the PostgreSQL database instance.
*   **SQL Execution Rights:** The attacker needs to have rights to execute SQL commands and create procedures that can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that this vulnerability affects multiple versions of PostgreSQL, including stable releases (7.2, 8.0) and unstable releases.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves patching the PL/PgSQL parser to prevent buffer overflows by performing appropriate bounds checks, with a more comprehensive cleanup planned for newer versions.
*   This CVE is often mentioned alongside other related PostgreSQL vulnerabilities such as CVE-2005-0244, CVE-2005-0246, and CVE-2005-0247, which are also addressed in some of the provided resources.

In summary, CVE-2005-0245 is a critical vulnerability due to the potential for arbitrary code execution on the server. It is caused by a buffer overflow in the PL/PgSQL parser when handling a high number of parameters in refcursor declarations. Any database user with SQL execution rights can potentially exploit this vulnerability.
