Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of the Legato NetWorker PortMapper (lgtomapper). Unlike typical portmapper implementations that restrict access to the `pmap_set` and `pmap_unset` calls (often limiting them to localhost), the Legato PortMapper allows these calls to be made from any host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Access to `pmap_set` and `pmap_unset`:** The core issue is that the Legato PortMapper does not properly restrict access to the `pmap_set` and `pmap_unset` RPC functions. This allows any remote host to manipulate port mappings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can use `pmap_unset` to unregister legitimate NetWorker services, effectively preventing them from functioning. This leads to a denial of service.
*   **Eavesdropping:** An attacker can use `pmap_set` to register a new RPC service and redirect communication intended for a legitimate NetWorker service to their own controlled service. This can enable them to eavesdrop on communications between NetWorker processes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely without any authentication. An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable port (7938/TCP by default).
*   **Direct RPC Calls:** Exploitation is achieved by directly making RPC calls to the vulnerable `pmap_set` and `pmap_unset` functions of the Legato PortMapper service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target system running the vulnerable Legato NetWorker PortMapper service on port 7938.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need any credentials or prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **RPC Knowledge:** The attacker would need some understanding of RPC calls to successfully interact with the `pmap_set` and `pmap_unset` functions

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple products that re-package Legato NetWorker, including Sun's Solstice Backup and StorEdge Enterprise Backup, FSC's Fujitsu Siemens Computers' NetWorker, NEC's WebSAM NetWorker, and Fujitsu's NetWorker.
*   Patches and upgrades are available from the respective vendors.
*   A workaround involves blocking access to the vulnerable port (7938/TCP) and the ports used by NetWorker (7937-9936/TCP and UDP) at the network perimeter, however, host-based firewalls are recommended as well to prevent exploitation from within the internal network.
