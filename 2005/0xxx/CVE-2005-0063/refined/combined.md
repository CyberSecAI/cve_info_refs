## Vulnerability Details

#### Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0063:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows Shell because of the way that it handles application association. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0063:

* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail or through a Web page. For an attack to be successful through e-mail a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* The vulnerability would generally be exploited through unregistered file name extension types. Systems that block unknown file name extension types or only allow known valid file name extension types would be at a reduced risk from this vulnerability.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.

#### Workarounds for Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0063:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable the HTML Application Host application.**

  This vulnerability takes advantage of functionality in the HTML Application Host application. Disabling the association with this application can help prevent attacks using this application. To disable the HTML Application Host application, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start,** and then click **Run**.
  2. Type "%windir%\system32\mshta.exe /unregister" without the quotation marks, and then press **ENTER**.

     **Note** To reverse these changes, change "/unregister" to "/register".

  **Impact of Workaround** This workaround removes the association between .hta files and the HTML Application Host application. Users who try to load .hta files by double-clicking them in the Windows Shell will be prompted to manually select an application to complete the loading of these file types. This change helps prevent malicious use of the Windows Shell to cause the HTML Application Host application to process other file name extensions.

#### FAQ for Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0063:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process that the affected software uses to validate which application should load a file. It is possible to convince the Windows Shell to start the HTML Application Host application when that application would not typically be used to process files.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An anonymous attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted file. Opening this file could then cause the affected system to run code. The vulnerability would generally be exploited through unregistered file name extension types.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Although Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition do contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Can the vulnerability be exploited automatically through an e-mail message?**

No. A user must open a malicious file that an attacker provides in order for the vulnerability to be exploited. Viewing an e-mail message, even if Microsoft Word is selected as the default e-mail editor for Microsoft Outlook, would not expose the vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows Shell validates the application that should be used to process documents.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

For more information about dual-mode packages, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 328848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/328848).
When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:

* Windows XP SP2

  The installer copies the SP2QFE files to your system.
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)

  The installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system.

If you have not previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:

* Windows XP SP2

  The installer copies the SP2GDR files to your system.
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)

  The installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

From:       [Nick FitzGerald <nick () virus-l ! demon ! co ! uk>](?a=92713806700002&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2005-05-29 13:30:53](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2&b=200505)

Yesterday at least two of my spam-traps received the following message
(I've elided the MIME boundary values just in case...):

   Subject: We make a business offer to you
   MIME-Version: 1.0
   Content-type: multipart/mixed;
           boundary="[...]"

   [...]
   Content-Type: text/plain;
           charset="Windows-1252"
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

   Hello!  It is not spam, so don't delete this message.
   We have a business offer to you.
   Read our offer.
   You can increase the business in 1,5 times.
   We hope you do not miss this information.

   Best regards, Keith

   [...]
   Content-type: application/octet-stream;
           name="agreement.zip"
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
   Content-Disposition: attachment;
           filename="agreement.zip"

   <<encoded ZIP file data>>

There are a few trivial differences between the messages to the
different addresses I checked, so don't anyone try to turn the above
into a totally literal filtering rule...

Anyway, the "agreement.zip" attachment held only one file, apparently
called "agreement.txt", but on closer inspection it turned out the file
was called "agreement.txt " where the apparent trailing space was
actually a 0xFF character.  This "pseudo-TXT" file was, in fact, an
OLE2 format file (originally a Word document file) with the OLE2 Root
Entry CLSID set to that of the Microsoft HTML Application Host (MSHTA).
This was all done as per the description in the iDEFENSE advisory
announcing this vulnerability:

   <http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=231&type=vulns>

This "pseudo-TXT" file is an example of what is produced by the PoC
generator posted to Bugtraq.  Oddly, that message is not archived in
SecurityFocus' own mailing list archives, but its PoC code is listed
with the vulnerability's BID entry:

   <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/13132/info/>

That PoC may be identified from the comment at the top of its code:

   MS05-016 POC
   Made By ZwelL
   zwell@sohu.com
   2005.4.13

Anyway, the "agreement.txt " file contained a script to write a text
file with commands and responses for use with the Windows ftp client
via its "-s" option and further commands to run ftp with those scripted

commands and then to run the executable that ftp script would cause to
be downloaded from a Russian web site.  At the time of writing, that
site is still up and the executable that is downloaded (a backdoor) is
the same one that was there when the spam was first seen.

If you haven't installed the MS05-016 Windows Shell patch yet:

   <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-016.mspx>

or at least taken reasonable precautions to defang possible
exploitation of this vulnerability (particularly through MSHTA), it
would be  advisable to do so now.  When initially discovered, only two
of more than 20 tested virus scanning engines detected the exploit in
"agreement.txt ".  Since alerting the antivirus developer community of
the field discovery of this exploit, a couple more "big name" scanners
have added a degree of detection for this exploit, and I expect that
number to grow as the new week dawns and new updates are pushed to
customers.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire cityâs water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.
