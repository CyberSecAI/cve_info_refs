- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Backup Exec Remote Agent for Windows Servers contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect validation on authentication requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient validation of authentication requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on computers where the Remote Agent is installed and gain administrative control.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malicious authentication request over the network to the vulnerable service, which listens on TCP port 10000 by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service. Publicly available exploit code exists.
