The provided content details multiple SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Photopost PHP Pro Photo Gallery Software.

**SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `showmembers.php` and `showphoto.php` scripts are vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through URL parameters like `sl` (in showmembers.php), `photo` (in showphoto.php).
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL injection can lead to database manipulation, information disclosure, and potentially complete compromise of the database.
    *   The provided exploit shows the application's error output, revealing the database structure and table names.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts (`showmembers.php`, `showphoto.php`) with malicious SQL code in URL parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft malicious SQL queries. No special access is needed to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**XSS Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input before being displayed in the web page.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of encoding of user input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious javascript code. Vulnerable scripts include `showgallery.php`, `showmembers.php` and `slideshow.php`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of the victim's browser.
    *   This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts using malicious javascript code in the URL parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft malicious Javascript code. No special access is needed to exploit these vulnerabilities.

The content includes Proof of Concept (PoC) exploits demonstrating the vulnerabilities, specifically using the javascript `alert(document.cookie)` to show how cookies can be accessed. It also mentions a potential fix using `htmlspeacialchars()`, `mysql_escape_string()`, `mysql_real_escape_string()` for input validation.
