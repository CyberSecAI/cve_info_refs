# Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200504-18**

New Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Suite releases fix new security
vulnerabilities, including memory disclosure and various ways of executing
JavaScript code with elevated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.7** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.7** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that includes a
mail and news reader. Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation browser
from the Mozilla project.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla Suite
and Mozilla Firefox:

* Vladimir V. Perepelitsa reported a memory disclosure bug in
  JavaScript's regular expression string replacement when using an
  anonymous function as the replacement argument (CAN-2005-0989).
* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 discovered that Chrome UI code was overly trusting DOM
  nodes from the content window, allowing privilege escalation via DOM
  property overrides.
* Michael Krax reported a possibility to run JavaScript code with
  elevated privileges through the use of javascript: favicons.
* Michael Krax also discovered that malicious Search plugins could
  run JavaScript in the context of the displayed page or stealthily
  replace existing search plugins.
* shutdown discovered a technique to pollute the global scope of a
  window in a way that persists from page to page.
* Doron Rosenberg discovered a possibility to run JavaScript with
  elevated privileges when the user asks to "Show" a blocked popup that
  contains a JavaScript URL.
* Finally, Georgi Guninski reported missing Install object instance
  checks in the native implementations of XPInstall-related JavaScript
  objects.

The following Firefox-specific vulnerabilities have also been
discovered:

* Kohei Yoshino discovered a new way to abuse the sidebar panel to
  execute JavaScript with elevated privileges.
* Omar Khan reported that the Plugin Finder Service can be tricked to
  open javascript: URLs with elevated privileges.

### Impact

The various JavaScript execution with elevated privileges issues can be
exploited by a remote attacker to install malicious code or steal data.
The memory disclosure issue can be used to reveal potentially sensitive
information. Finally, the cache pollution issue and search plugin abuse
can be leveraged in cross-site-scripting attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.3"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.3"
```

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.7"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.7"
```

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-33

## Javascript "lambda" replace exposes memory contents

Announced
April 15, 2005
Reporter
Azafran/Vladimir V. Perepelitsa
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.3
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.7

### Description

A bug in javascript's regular expression string replacement when using an
anonymous function as the replacement argument allows a malicious script
to capture blocks of memory allocated to the browser. A web site could
capture data and transmit it to a server without user interaction or
knowledge.

The attacker cannot control what will be captured, but the data returned
sometimes contains bits of websites the user has recently visited and
their addresses. The data could be sifted to find the occasional valuable
bits of information.

### Workaround

Disable Javascript.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Lacking block scope and dynamically scoped variables, JS has never tried to
emulate Perl's dynamic scope for $1, $&, etc. with the pre-ECMA extensions
analogous to those vars (RegExp.$1, RegExp.lastMatch, etc). Here's a case
where it must.

This bug is not entirely solved!!
If you go to the secunia site
<http://secunia.com/mozilla_products_arbitrary_memory_exposure_test>
and do the test with 1.0.2, it shows some contents of the memory.
Now with 1.0.3 (linux) it only shows some X's, but the entire system crashes
after doing this test a few times!!
Dont know if this is another problem, but here it is, since it's triggered by
the same thing..

This bug was fixed after Firefox 1.0.2. I just checked secunia with Firefox
1.0.4 and it does not show the 'XXX'. Please upgrade to 1.0.4 as it contains
significant security updates and retest.

Heh! It SHOULD show "XXX..." because it's correct behaviour of the script.

You are right of course, doh! but it looks like a variant of [bug 293940](/show_bug.cgi?id=293940 "NEW - alert displays blank dialog when string contains >= 5460 chars without a space") prevents
the string from displaying. You can check that the mem string is 'XXX...X' by
setting a breakpoint at line 247 in the page where
document.getElementById('result').value = mem;

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
