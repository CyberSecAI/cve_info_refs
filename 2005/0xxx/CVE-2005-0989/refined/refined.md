      "Memory Disclosure",
       "The JavaScript engine did not properly manage memory allocation when using regular expression string replacements with anonymous functions. Specifically, the `cx->regExpStatics`  was not properly stacked and unstacked around lambda invocations, leading to potential reallocations of memory by inner matches. "
