  "CVE-2005-0398": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the ISAKMP header parsing code of IPsec-Tools' racoon daemon. By sending a specially crafted ISAKMP packet, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the length field within generic ISAKMP headers. The racoon daemon parses these headers and uses the length field for subsequent operations, such as memory allocation and data processing. However, a malicious attacker can provide a length field smaller than the minimum expected size for a header (e.g. a length less than the size of the isakmp_gen structure). This can result in a number of issues.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient validation of ISAKMP header length",
        "Use of potentially negative values in calculations",
        "Uncontrolled memory allocation based on malformed data",
         "Potential for vmalloc(0) or vmalloc(-1) calls leading to undefined behaviour or heap corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can send crafted ISAKMP packets which will cause the racoon daemon to crash, leading to a denial-of-service. This impacts both VPN gateways and VPN clients when setting up or handling IKE SAs, and can be triggered during inform, quick, and base modes.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted ISAKMP packets",
        "Remote, unauthenticated attacker"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not require authentication and can be in a remote position. They need to be able to send UDP packets to the target's IPsec endpoint."
