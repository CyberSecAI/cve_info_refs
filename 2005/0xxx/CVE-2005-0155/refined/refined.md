{
  "CVE-2005-0155": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in how environment variables were handled in the setuid wrapper for Perl (sperl).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The perl-suid wrapper incorrectly handles the PERLIO_DEBUG environment variable, allowing a local user to specify a file path where debug information will be written with elevated privileges.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can cause the perl-suid wrapper to create arbitrary files or append debug information to existing files with root privileges, leading to file overwriting or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation via execution of setuid perl scripts after setting the PERLIO_DEBUG environment variable.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to a system with setuid perl scripts and the ability to set environment variables."
  }
