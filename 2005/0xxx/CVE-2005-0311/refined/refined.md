Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the Ingate Firewall's failure to terminate active PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) connections when a user is disabled. The system only blocks new connection attempts after the user is disabled, leaving existing connections active.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent User Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the inconsistent enforcement of user access control. Disabling a user should immediately revoke their access, including active sessions.
*   **Lack of Session Management:** The Ingate Firewall lacks proper session management for PPTP connections. It does not actively monitor and terminate active sessions when a user's status changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker, whose account has been disabled by the firewall administrator, can maintain access to resources protected by the firewall. This access persists for as long as the active PPTP tunnel remains up.
*   **Data Breach:** Continued access could allow the attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data or cause damage to the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **PPTP Tunnel Persistence:** The attacker establishes a PPTP connection before being disabled, exploiting the firewall's inability to terminate active sessions.
*   **Internal Network Access:** Once the tunnel is established, it provides a route for the attacker to access internal resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker initially requires valid user credentials to establish a PPTP connection.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker does not need specific knowledge of this vulnerability to exploit it. They only need to maintain an active PPTP connection before being disabled to exploit the weakness.

In summary, the vulnerability is a flaw in the access control mechanism of the Ingate Firewall, where disabling a user does not terminate existing PPTP connections, allowing unauthorized access to continue.
