- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `members` parameter in the URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, potentially leading to stealing cookies, session hijacking, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL where the `members` parameter is manipulated to include malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and induce a victim to access it.
