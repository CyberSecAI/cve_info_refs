Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in the AtHoc Toolbar:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:**  Occurs when an overly long skin name is provided to the `SetSkin()` method of an ActiveX component within the AtHoc toolbar.
2.  **Format String Vulnerability:** Occurs when an invalid URL is passed to the `SetBaseURL()` function. The invalid URL is then written to a debug log, and this logging process is vulnerable to a format string attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Buffer Overflow:** The `SetSkin()` method fails to properly validate the length of the skin name, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. This allows overwriting saved return addresses and eventually achieving arbitrary code execution.
2.  **Format String Bug:** The debug logging mechanism does not sanitize the base URL before writing it to a log file, allowing attackers to use format string specifiers within the URL to overwrite arbitrary memory locations.
3.  **Unsafe ActiveX Control:** The vulnerable ActiveX control is marked as "safe for scripting" by default, allowing access to the dangerous functions through scripting with minimal user interaction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:**  Both vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:**  A specially crafted web page can be used to trigger both vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer.  The ActiveX control can be interacted with via scripting from the webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious web page to the victim. The victim needs to have the vulnerable AtHoc Toolbar installed. No special privileges are required to exploit these vulnerabilities, as they operate within the context of the logged-in user.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory mentions a list of popular vendors who distribute the vulnerable toolbar including eBay, Accenture, ThomasRegister, ThomasRegional, Juniper Networks, WiredNews, CarFax and Agile PLM.
*   AtHoc released an updated version to fix these issues.
*   NGSSoftware withheld details for three months to allow vendors time to distribute patches before public disclosure.
