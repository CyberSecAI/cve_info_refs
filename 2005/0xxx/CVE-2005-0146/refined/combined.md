| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=265728#c0)• 20 years ago |
|  | |

Steps to reproduce on Windows:
1. Go to about:config and middlemouse.paste to true.
2. Copy something to the Windows clipboard.
3. Load the testcase.
Result: the contents of your clipboard are pasted once a second.
On Linux, I imagine this would paste the X primary selection rather than the
contents of the clipboard (without any hidden pref changes).

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-08

## Synthetic middle-click event can steal clipboard contents

Announced
January 21, 2005
Reporter
Jesse Ruderman
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.5

### Description

Script-generated middle-click events can steal clipboard contents
on systems where that action is a paste. Middle-click paste is the
default behavior on Unix systems, and a hidden option elsewhere.
