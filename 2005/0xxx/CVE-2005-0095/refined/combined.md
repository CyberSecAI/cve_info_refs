Debian Security Advisory DSA 651-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
January 20th, 2005                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : squid
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow, integer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0094 CAN-2005-0095

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid, the internet
object cache, the popular WWW proxy cache.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures Project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CAN-2005-0094

    "infamous41md" discovered a buffer overflow in the parser for
    Gopher responses which will lead to memory corruption and usually
    crash Squid.

CAN-2005-0095

    "infamous41md" discovered an integer overflow in the receiver of
    WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol) messages.  An attacker
    could send a specially crafted UDP datagram that will cause Squid
    to crash.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.6-2woody5.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.7-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Squid: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200501-25**

Squid contains vulnerabilities in the the code handling NTLM (NT Lan
Manager), Gopher to HTML, ACLs and WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol)
which could lead to ACL bypass, denial of service and arbitrary code
execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-proxy/squid** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.7-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.7-r2** |

### Background

Squid is a full-featured Web proxy cache designed to run on Unix
systems. It supports proxying and caching of HTTP, FTP, and other URLs,
as well as SSL support, cache hierarchies, transparent caching, access
control lists and many other features.

### Description

Squid contains a vulnerability in the gopherToHTML function
(CAN-2005-0094) and incorrectly checks the 'number of caches' field
when parsing WCCP\_I\_SEE\_YOU messages (CAN-2005-0095). Furthermore the
NTLM code contains two errors. One is a memory leak in the
fakeauth\_auth helper (CAN-2005-0096) and the other is a NULL pointer
dereferencing error (CAN-2005-0097). Finally Squid also contains an
error in the ACL parsing code (CAN-2005-0194).

### Impact

With the WCCP issue an attacker could cause denial of service by
sending a specially crafted UDP packet. With the Gopher issue an
attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code by enticing a user to
connect to a malicious Gopher server. The NTLM issues could lead to
denial of service by memory consumption or by crashing Squid. The ACL
issue could lead to ACL bypass.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/squid-2.5.7-r2"
```

=== Content from www.squid-cache.org_cf802899_20250125_124151.html ===
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2005:2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2005:2
Date: January 15, 2005
Summary: Denial of service by forged WCCP messages
Affected versions: All versions up to and including 2.5.STABLE7
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2005\_2.txt
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
A bug exists in the code that parses WCCP messages. An attacker
that sends a malformed WCCP messages, with a spoofed source address
matching Squid's "home router" can crash Squid.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
The bug is important because it allows remote attackers to crash
Squid, causing a disription in service. However, the bug is
exploitable only if you have configured Squid to send WCCP messages
to a router, and only if the attacker can send UDP messages with
a forged source address.
Sites that do not use WCCP are not vulnerable.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
An individual patch for this issues can be found in our
patch archive for version Squid-2.5.STABLE7:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/bugs/squid-2.5.STABLE7-wccp\_denial\_of\_service.patch
If necessary, this short patch should also apply to previous
versions of Squid.
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please
refer to the package vendor for availability information on
updated packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
Your installation is vulnerable if:
(1) you have configured Squid to send WCCP messages to a router,
and thus expect replies from a router, and
(2) UDP messages with spoofed source addresses can reach Squid.
For (1), look for the 'wccp\_router' dirctive in your squid.conf
file. Also, look for this line in cache.log:
Accepting WCCP messages on port 2048, FD 15
For (2), whether or not your network accepts spoofed packets
depends on the features and configuration of your networking
equipment.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
If WCCP is not essential to your operation, disable it
by commenting out the 'wccp\_router' directive in
squid.conf.
You may also compile Squid without any WCCP code at all
by giving the --disable-wccp option to the ./configure
script.
Finally, enable features, such as unicast reverse
path forwarding (uRPF), on your routers and switches
to prevent spoofed packets from reaching Squid.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support: Your first point of contact
should be your binary package vendor.
If your install is built from the original Squid sources, then
the squid-users@squid-cache.org mailing list is your primary
support point. (see
for subscription details).
For bug reporting, particularly security related bugs the
squid-bugs@squid-cache.org mailing list is the appropriate forum.
It's a closed list (though anyone can post) and security related
bug reports are treated in confidence until the impact has been
established. For non security related bugs, the squid bugzilla
database should be used .

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
