        "vulnerability": "MySQL fails to properly validate input for authenticated users with INSERT and DELETE privileges.",
        "impact": "An attacker with INSERT and DELETE privileges could exploit this to manipulate the mysql table or accessing libc calls, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running MySQL.",

      {
        "source": "marc.info_9271050b_20250124_162224.html",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the udf_init() function in sql_udf.cc not checking if the 'dl' field (shared library path) in the mysql.func table contains a '/'.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Lack of input validation when reading shared library paths from the `mysql.func` table during server startup.",
          "Bypassing the path restriction imposed during function creation using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement, by directly manipulating the `mysql.func` table using `INSERT INTO`."

        "impact": "Allows an attacker with INSERT and DELETE privileges on the 'mysql' administrative database to load a library from an arbitrary directory and execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the MySQL server.",
        "attack_vector": "An authenticated user with INSERT and DELETE privileges on the 'mysql' administrative database, can insert a malicious library path into the `mysql.func` table. Restarting the mysql server loads the malicious library.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs INSERT and DELETE privileges on the mysql database. Remote exploitation is possible if the database user has FILE privilege"

        "vulnerability": "MySQL allows remote authenticated users with INSERT and DELETE privileges to bypass library path restrictions and execute arbitrary libraries by using INSERT INTO to modify the mysql.func table.",

        "attack_vector": "Requires authenticated user with INSERT and DELETE privileges to modify the mysql.func table."

    ],
    "summary": "The vulnerability allows an authenticated user with INSERT and DELETE privileges on the mysql database to bypass path restrictions and execute arbitrary code by inserting a malicious path into the mysql.func table and restarting the MySQL server. The root cause is that the `udf_init()` function does not validate the library path when loading data from `mysql.func` table."
