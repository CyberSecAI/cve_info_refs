- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The osCommerce 2.2-MS2 application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `contact_us.php` page, specifically within the `enquiry` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Stealing of sensitive user information
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious script into the `enquiry` parameter of the `contact_us.php` page through a crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious script and have a victim user access this URL. The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges on the application.
