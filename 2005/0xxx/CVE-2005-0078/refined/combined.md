Package        : kdebse
Vulnerability  : missing return value check
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0078

Raphaël Enrici discovered that the KDE screensaver can crash under
certain local circumstances.  This can be exploited by an attacker
with physical access to the workstation to take over the desktop
session.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-14.9.

This problem has been fixed upstream in KDE 3.0.5 and is therefore
fixed in the unstable (sid) and testing (sarge) distributions already.

We recommend that you upgrade your kscreensaver package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
