# Konversation: Various vulnerabilities — GLSA **200501-34**

Konversation contains multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to remote
command execution or information leaks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-irc/konversation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.15.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.15.1** |

### Background

Konversation is a user-friendly IRC client for KDE.

### Description

Wouter Coekaerts has discovered three vulnerabilities within
Konversation:

* The Server::parseWildcards function, which
  is used by the "Quick Buttons", does not properly handle variable
  expansion (CAN-2005-0129).
* Perl scripts included with
  Konversation do not properly escape shell metacharacters
  (CAN-2005-0130).
* The 'Nick' and 'Password' fields in the Quick
  Connect dialog can be easily confused (CAN-2005-0131).

### Impact

A malicious server could create specially-crafted channels, which
would exploit certain flaws in Konversation, potentially leading to the
execution of shell commands. A user could also unintentionally input
their password into the 'Nick' field in the Quick Connect dialog,
exposing his password to IRC users, and log files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Konversation users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/konversation-0.15.1"
```

KDE Security Advisory: Multiple vulnerabilities in Konversation
Original Release Date: 20050121

1. Systems affected:
All Konversation versions up to and including 0.15
2. Overview:
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Konversation,
an IRC client for KDE.
A flaw in the expansion of %-escaped variables makes that %-escaped
variables in certain input strings will be inadvertently expanded
too. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2005-0129 to this issue.
Several perl scripts included with Konversation fail to properly
handle command line arguments causing a command line injection
vulnerability. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0130 to this issue.
Nick and password are confused in the quick connection dialog,
so connecting with that dialog and filling in a password, would
use that password as nick, and may inadvertently expose the
password to others. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0131 to this issue.
3. Impact:
A user might be tricked to join a channel with a specially crafted
channel name containing shell commands. If user runs a script in
that channel it will result in an arbitrary command execution.
If quick connect is used with a password, the password is used as
nickname instead. As a result the password may be exposed to others.
4. Solution:
Upgrade to Konversation 0.15.1 available from
http://download.berlios.de/konversation/konversation-0.15.1.tar.bz2
5. Patch:
A patch for Konversation 0.15 is available from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security\_patches
36f8b6beac18a9d173339388d13e2335 post-0.15-konversation.diff
6. Time line and credits:
18/01/2005 Konversation developers informed by Wouter Coekaerts
19/01/2005 Patches applied to KDE CVS.
19/01/2005 Konversation 0.15.1 released.
21/01/2005 KDE Security Advisory released.

On 18 and 19 Jan 2005 I (Wouter Coekaerts) discovered 3 security
vulnerabilities in Konversation ("A user-friendly IRC-client for KDE",
<http://konversation.berlios.de/>).

Affected are version 0.15, CVS until 18-19/01/2005, and some older versions
too. They are fixed in 0.15.1.

Problem 1. Quick Buttons
========================
The Server::parseWildcards function is buggy: to expand % variables, it does
a series of QString.replace's, so the value for one variable can contain
another variable, which will then be expanded too. This function is used for
the "Quick Buttons" under the nicklist (which is disabled by default)

The only way I found to exploit this from another client, would be to let a
user join a channel with such vars in its name, and then let the user press
the Part Button. But since channel names cannot have spaces, only very
simple things can be done.
For example: in #%n/quit%n, he will disconnect.
An 'evil' server might be able to do this for other Quick Buttons too.

Problem 2. Included Perl scripts vulnerable to shell command injection
======================================================================
Perl scripts included with Konversation execute a command line similar to:
exec ("dcop $PORT Konversation say $SERVER \"$TARGET\" output");
shell characters in $SERVER or $TARGET aren't escaped.

Joining #`kwrite` and executing a script (for example typing /uptime) will
start kwrite. A song with a strange name may also cause command execution
with the media script.

Problem 3. Nick and password confused in quick connect dialog
=============================================================
I'll leave the question of wether or not this actually is a security bug
open, but at least I can imagine someone could see it as one.
Nick and password are confused in the quick connection dialog, so connecting
with that dialog and filling in a password, would use that password as nick.
If connecting works, you'll show everyone your password that was probably
a password for something else (since you could connecting with your nick as
password instead). If connecting fails because the server did require a
password, it may show an oper watching server notices your password and/or
put it in a logfile.

Solution
========
These problems are fixed in version 0.15.1, which was released 19/01/05
