# Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-30**

The Mozilla Suite is vulnerable to multiple issues ranging from the remote
execution of arbitrary code to various issues allowing to trick the user
into trusting fake web sites or interacting with privileged content.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.6** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.6** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that
includes a mail and news reader.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla
Suite:

* Mark Dowd from ISS X-Force reported an exploitable
  heap overrun in the GIF processing of obsolete Netscape extension 2
  (CAN-2005-0399)
* Michael Krax reported that plugins can be used
  to load privileged content and trick the user to interact with it
  (CAN-2005-0232, CAN-2005-0527)
* Michael Krax also reported
  potential spoofing or cross-site-scripting issues through overlapping
  windows, image or scrollbar drag-and-drop, and by dropping javascript:
  links on tabs (CAN-2005-0230, CAN-2005-0231, CAN-2005-0401,
  CAN-2005-0591)
* Daniel de Wildt and Gael Delalleau discovered a
  memory overwrite in a string library (CAN-2005-0255)
* Wind Li
  discovered a possible heap overflow in UTF8 to Unicode conversion
  (CAN-2005-0592)
* Eric Johanson reported that Internationalized
  Domain Name (IDN) features allow homograph attacks (CAN-2005-0233)
* Mook, Doug Turner, Kohei Yoshino and M. Deaudelin reported various
  ways of spoofing the SSL "secure site" indicator (CAN-2005-0593)
* Georgi Guninski discovered that XSLT can include stylesheets from
  arbitrary hosts (CAN-2005-0588)
* Secunia discovered a way of
  injecting content into a popup opened by another website
  (CAN-2004-1156)
* Phil Ringnalda reported a possible way to
  spoof Install source with user:pass@host (CAN-2005-0590)
* Jakob
  Balle from Secunia discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download
  dialog source (CAN-2005-0585)
* Christian Schmidt reported a
  potential spoofing issue in HTTP auth prompt tab (CAN-2005-0584)
* Finally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
  discovered that Mozilla insecurely creates temporary filenames in
  /tmp/plugtmp (CAN-2005-0578)

### Impact

* The GIF heap overflow could be triggered by a malicious GIF
  image that would end up executing arbitrary code with the rights of the
  user running Mozilla. The other overflow issues, while not thought to
  be exploitable, would have the same impact
* By setting up
  malicious websites and convincing users to follow untrusted links or
  obey very specific drag-and-drop or download instructions, attackers
  may leverage the various spoofing issues to fake other websites to get
  access to confidential information, push users to download malicious
  files or make them interact with their browser preferences
* The
  temporary directory issue allows local attackers to overwrite arbitrary
  files with the rights of another local user

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.6"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.6"
```

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-30

## GIF heap overflow parsing Netscape extension 2

Announced
March 22, 2005
Reporter
Mark Dowd (ISS X-Force)
Risk
High
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.2
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.6
* Thunderbird 1.0.2

### Description

An GIF processing error when parsing the obsolete Netscape extension 2
can lead to an exploitable heap overrun, allowing an attacker to run
arbitrary code on the user's machine.

### Workaround

Turn off image display. Upgrade to the fixed version.

Important Note: The image blocking used in Mozilla Thunderbird and the
mail client in the Mozilla Suite only blocks images loaded from
remote servers. It will still display "in-line" images and is insufficient
to protect against a potential attack. Instead, on the View menu choose
"Message Body As" and set it to "Plain Text".

We, of course, recommend upgrading to the fixed version.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Mozilla products vulnerable to heap overflow via specially crafted GIF file

#### Vulnerability Note VU#557948

Original Release Date: 2005-03-30 | Last Revised: 2005-12-22

---

### Overview

Mozilla products, including the Mozilla Suite, Mozilla Firefox, and Mozilla Thunderbird, are vulnerable to a heap-based overflow in the GIF image-processing routines.

### Description

| The Mozilla project produces an application suite (Mozilla Suite), web browsers (Mozilla Firefox), email software (Mozilla Thunderbird), and other products.  An image processing library used in some Mozilla products contains a flaw in Graphic Interchange Format (GIF) file handling. A Netscape-specific extension block (Netscape extension 2) may be present in the GIF file that contains a 32-bit integer. This integer is used to determine image buffer space. An attacker may misrepresent this value to exploit a heap overflow condition. The attacker can craft a special GIF file that, when viewed, induces a heap overflow in the Mozilla product that is processing the GIF file. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code as the local user if the user loads a specially crafted GIF file (for example, a GIF-format image in a web page or email message). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The vulnerability is addressed in the following Mozilla product releases:[Mozilla Suite](http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/) 1.7.6[Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) 1.0.2[Mozilla Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) 1.0.2Note that other products that use the same image processing library may also be affected. |
| --- |

| The Mozilla project recommends turning off image loading as a temporary workaround until an update is applied. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=150877#c0)  Josh Bressers    2005-03-11 16:01:42 UTC  ``` The mozilla applications contain several image decoders for displaying images  of various formats. Amoung the most common image formats is the Graphic  Information File (GIF) format. The code for this parser is located in:  mozilla/modules/libpr0n/decoders/gif/GIF2.cpp  A vulnerability exists in the parsing of a Netscape-specific extension block  that specifies a 32-bit size integer indicating how much image data the  application should buffer, which is shown (taken from the gif_write()  function).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=150877#c1)  Josh Bressers    2005-03-23 18:35:12 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=150877#c2)  Josh Bressers    2005-03-23 19:21:22 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
