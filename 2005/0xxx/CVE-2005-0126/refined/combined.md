## Apple Mac OS X vulnerable to buffer overflow in ColorSync ICC color profile handling

#### Vulnerability Note VU#980078

Original Release Date: 2005-01-27 | Last Revised: 2005-01-27

---

### Overview

Apple's Mac OS X operating system contains a flaw in the handling of ICC color profiles, which may allow arbitrary code execution through a heap-based buffer overflow.

### Description

| The Apple Mac OS X operating system contains support for ICC color profiles in the ColorSync component. This component contains a flaw in checking boundary conditions which may allow arbitrary code execution. When checking certain parameters in ICC color profiles, improperly formatted or maliciously crafted embedded profiles may cause a heap-based buffer overflow which would allow arbitrary code execution. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with the ability to supply a maliciously crafted profile may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.  The attacker-supplied code would be executed with the privileges of the user running ColorSync. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**  Apple advises all users to apply Apple Security Update 2005-001, as it fixes this flaw and other critical security flaws. More information can be found at:<<http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300770>> |
