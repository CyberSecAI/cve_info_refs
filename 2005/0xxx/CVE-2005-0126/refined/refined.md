The content is related to CVE-2005-0126.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the way Apple's Mac OS X ColorSync component handles ICC color profiles. Specifically, the component fails to properly check boundary conditions when parsing ICC profiles.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ColorSync component's handling of ICC color profiles. This occurs because of insufficient boundary checking on parameters within the ICC profiles.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who can supply a specially crafted ICC profile could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. The code would run with the privileges of the user running ColorSync.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the supply of a maliciously crafted ICC color profile to a vulnerable system. This could be achieved through various means such as embedding the profile within an image file or document.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to supply a maliciously crafted ICC profile to the system. This may involve tricking a user into opening a document or file that includes the malicious profile.
