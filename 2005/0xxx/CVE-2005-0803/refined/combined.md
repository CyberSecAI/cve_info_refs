How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Windows buffer overflow in Enhanced Metafile rendering API

#### Vulnerability Note VU#134756

Original Release Date: 2005-11-08 | Last Revised: 2005-11-09

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows Enhanced Metafile Format image rendering routines contain a buffer overflow flaw that may allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| Microsoft describes the Enhanced Metafile Format (EMF) as the following:  *An EMF image is a 32-bit format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. This format is an improvement over the Windows Metafile Format and contains extended features. For more information about image types and formats, see* [*Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314*](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;320314)*. Additional information about these file formats is also available at the* [*MSDN Library Web Site*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdicpp/GDIPlus/AboutGDIPlus/ImagesBitmapsandMetafiles/Metafiles.asp)*.*The Microsoft Windows EMF rendering routines may fail to properly check a buffer length, possibly resulting in a crash of the affected application or in the application failing to respond. Any program that uses these routines to render a specially-crafted image file is vulnerable to the issue.Proof of concept code related to this issue is known to be available at this time. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may cause an affected application to stop responding or crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Please see [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-053](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-053.mspx) for details on updates, workarounds, and solutions. |
| --- |

| **Do not access EMF files from untrusted sources**Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted EMF file (typically .emf). By only accessing EMF files from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced.Attackers may host malicious EMF files on a website. In order to convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generallygood security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why was this bulletin revised on December 9, 2008?**

This bulletin was revised to communicate the availability of an updated version of the Windows Server 2003 update package. The update was revised to address minor issues unrelated to the stability of the update or the security of the intended target systems. Customers who have already successfully applied this update need not take any action. Windows Server 2003 customers who never installed the previous update will now be offered the revised update. The applicability of this bulletin on other Windows operating systems has not changed.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces several prior security updates. The security bulletin IDs and affected operating systems are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Windows 2000 | Windows XP Service Pack 1 | Windows XP Service Pack 2 | Windows Server 2003 | Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MS03-045** | Not Replaced | Replaced | Not Applicable | Not Replaced | Not Applicable |
| **MS05-002** | Not Replaced | Replaced | Not Applicable | Not Replaced | Not Applicable |

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 ended on June 30, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a ended on December 31, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 have reached the end of their life cycles. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT 4.0 SP6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Security update support for Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

With the release of Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) will no longer receive security update support. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. Microsoft will continue to fully support Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based systems, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions for 64-bit computing requirements. Microsoft continues to license and support Windows Server 2003 Enterprise and Datacenter editions for Itanium-based systems, and the 64-bit version of SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition. In the future we will expand Itanium support to Visual Studio 2005, .NET Framework 2005 and SQL Server 2005.

Customers who require additional assistance about this issue must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for information about the available migration options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Graphics Rendering Engine - CAN-2005-2123:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the rendering of Windows Metafile (WMF) and Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image formats that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. Any program that renders WMF or EMF images on the affected systems could be vulnerable to this attack. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Graphics Rendering Engine - CAN-2005-2123:

* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who persuaded a user to open a specially crafted file or to view a folder that contains the specially crafted image. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a malicious file, except potentially through previewing an email message.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.

#### Workarounds for Graphics Rendering Engine - CAN-2005-2123:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for Graphics Rendering Engine - CAN-2005-2123:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. This vulnerability could also be used to attempt to perform a local elevation of privilege or a remote denial of service.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the rendering of Windows Metafile (WMF) and Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image formats.

**What are Windows Metafile (WMF) and Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image formats?**

A WMF image is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.

An EMF image is a 32-bit format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. This format is an improvement over the Windows Metafile Format and contains extended features.

For more information about image types and formats, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;320314). Additional information about these file formats is also available at the [MSDN Library Web Site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms536391.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

Any program that renders the affected image types could be vulnerable to this attack. Here are some examples of how an attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability:

* An attacker could host a malicious Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site.
* An attacker could create an HTML e-mail message that has a specially crafted image attached. The specially crafted image could be designed to exploit this vulnerability through Microsoft Outlook or through Outlook Express 6. An attacker could persuade the user to view the HTML e-mail message.
* An attacker could embed a specially crafted image in an Office document and then persuade the user to view the document.
* An attacker could add a specially crafted image to the local file system or onto a network share and then persuade the user to preview the folder.
* If an attacker is able to log on locally, they could then run a specially-designed program that could exploit the vulnerability, and thereby gain complete control over the affected system.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could log on to the system interactively or by using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely). To locally exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially-designed application that could exploit the vulnerability, and thereby gain complete control over the affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability could be exploited on the affected systems by an attacker who persuaded a user to open a specially crafted file or to view a folder that contains the specially crafted image. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file, except potentially through previewing an email message. Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and run programs or browse the Internet. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability through malicious Web sites or through email over the Internet.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Graphics Rendering Engine processes Windows Metafile (WMF) and Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image formats.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |

* [Microsoft Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120)
* [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134) (MBSA)
* [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130)
* [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate)
* Windows Update Catalog: For more information about the Windows Update Catalog, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 323166](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/323166).

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

**Disclaimer:**

The information provided in the Microsoft Knowledge Base is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Microsoft disclaims all warranties, either express or implied, including the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. In no event shall Microsoft Corporation or its suppliers be liable for any damages whatsoever including direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, loss of business profits or special damages, even if Microsoft Corporation or its suppliers have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages so the foregoing limitation may not apply.

**Revisions:**

* V1.0 (November 8, 2005): Bulletin published.
* V1.1 (November 30, 2005): Bulletin updated to correct file information for x64 platforms.
* V1.2 (December 9, 2008): Bulletin updated to add an entry in the section, **Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update**, about a minor revision of the Windows Server 2003 package. Customers who have already successfully applied the previous update need not take any action.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

     Windows 2000 GDI32.DLL GetEnhMetaFilePaletteEntries() API specially crafted EMF \
file DOS vulnerability

1. Description

Windows 2000 GDI32.DLL GetEnhMetaFilePaletteEntries() API
doesn't process the EMF file properly, a application which calls
the API will crash when it reads some specially crafted EMF files.

2. Detail

Let us review the code:

77F68D12        POP ESI
77F68D13        RETN 0C
-----------------------------------------------------------
Translated into C Code
-----------------------------------------------------------
UINT GetEnhMetaFilePaletteEntries(
    HENHMETAFILE hemf,	// handle of enhanced metafile
    UINT cEntries,	// count of palette entries
    LPPALETTEENTRY lppe 	// address of palette-entry array
   )
{
        char *begin, *end, *emreof, *palent;
        DWORD count, i;

        // ......

        begin = emf file offset in memory;

        // get the count of palette entries from the emf file
        count = *((DWORD *)(begin + 0x44));

        if (lppe == 0)
                 return count;

        if (size > count)
                 size = count;

        // find the end of the emf file
        end = begin + *((DWORD *)(bigin + 0x30));

        // find the offset of emreof
        emreof = end - *((DWORD *)(end - 0x04));

        // find the offset of palentries
        palent = emreof + *((DWORD *)(emreof + 0x0c));

        // copy the palent from the file to palette-entry array
        for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
                 memcpy(lppe + i, palent + i * 4, 4);

        return size;
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

You can see that there isn't validity check, so it may cause
access violation when it uses the offset value("end", "emreof",
"palent") which read from the EMF.

3. Impact

The specific impact depends on the application using the API.
Generally, if there is a non-zero value in EMRHEAD->nPalEntries,
the application will call this API, and pass EMRHEAD->nPalEntries
to the second parameter, a specially crafted EMF will crash
the Application if the address it accesses to is not valid.

<<< Explorer.exe >>>

The explorer.exe(maybe a DLL called by explorer) always use
0x100 as the second parameter. And even if there is a zero
value in EMRHEAD->nPalEntries, if the "end" value in the end
of EMF file is bigger than some value(0x14 ??? I'm not sure),
it will also call this API to get the Palette entries.(strangely ?)

When you open the explorer.exe to open the folder which has a
crafted EMF file, if you click on the file in explorer's right
client area, just click, the explorer.exe will display the EMF file
in its left client area which will crash itself.

4. POC

A hex dumped EMF file:
-------------------------------------------------------
0000000 01 00 00 00 64 00 00 00 93 00 00 00 02 00 00 00
0000010 83 01 00 00 39 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0000020 d1 08 00 00 be 06 00 00 20 45 4d 46 00 00 01 00
0000030 78 00 00 00 17 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 0f 00 00 00
0000040 64 00 00 00 41 00 00 00 c8 12 00 00 c2 1a 00 00
0000050 cc 00 00 00 22 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0000060 00 00 00 00 0e 00 00 00 14 00 00 00 41 00 00 00
0000070 41 42 43 44 00 00 01 ff
-------------------------------------------------------

If it doesn't crash your explorer.exe, change the last 8
byte's values and try again, but I think it needn't change:)

Or you can change some normal EMF files in your Win2k to test.
