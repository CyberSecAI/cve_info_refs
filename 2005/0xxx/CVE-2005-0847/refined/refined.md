Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-0847

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition caused by the Ocean FTP Server v1.00's inability to handle multiple connection requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The server fails to properly manage or limit incoming connection attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service, rendering the FTP server unavailable. The provided exploit code uses a loop to repeatedly attempt to connect to the server until it is unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring an attacker to send a large number of connection requests to the vulnerable FTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  *   The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target FTP server.
  *   The attacker needs the ability to send TCP connection requests to the target server on the specified port.
  *   The provided exploit code is a simple perl script.

**Additional details**

* The exploit script attempts to open 109 sockets and connect to the target, if any of the connections fail, the target is considered DoS'ed and the script waits for the amount of seconds passed as an argument, shuts down all connections and exits
