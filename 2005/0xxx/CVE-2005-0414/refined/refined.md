Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in MercuryBoard 1.1.1:

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `qu` parameter in `func/post.php` when the `reply` switch is used. The code directly includes this parameter in a SQL query without any validation or escaping.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of proper input sanitization/validation in various parameters across different scripts such as `/func/pm.php` (parameter 's'), `/func/members.php` (parameter 'l'), and other locations allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The lack of input validation on the `$num` variable in `global.php` leads to a division-by-zero error, revealing the full path of the script. Other full path disclosure issues exist in various files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript or HTML into web pages, leading to potential execution in users' browsers.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Exposes the full file system paths, which can be used to gather information about the server or aid other attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   The attacker could potentially bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive data such as user credentials (username/password hashes).
    *   An attacker could modify or delete arbitrary data in the database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Stealing user cookies, which could lead to session hijacking
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
*   **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   Disclosure of server internal information (paths)
    *   Assistance to other attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   By manipulating the `qu` GET parameter in `index.php?a=post&s=reply` URL.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   By injecting malicious scripts in various GET parameters, including `s` in `index.php?a=pm`, `l` in `index.php?a=members`, and others in various pages and scripts.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   By setting `n=0` in `index.php?a=forum&f=2&min=0&n=0`
    *   By directly accessing certain files in the `lib/jpgraph` directory and other directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Basic understanding of SQL.
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests with manipulated parameters.
    *   The attacker needs a valid session that permits replying to the topic (although the vulnerability can be triggered with a non-existent topic id), since the original query does not use the topic id from 't' parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests with manipulated parameters.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests with manipulated parameters or directly accessing files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The SQL Injection vulnerability is triggered when the `s` parameter is set to `reply` and the `qu` parameter is passed via GET. The value of the `qu` parameter is directly concatenated into a SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   The XSS vulnerabilities are present in multiple locations due to the lack of proper sanitization of GET parameters.
*   The provided proof of concept for SQL injection shows how to extract user passwords, highlighting the severity.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in MercuryBoard version 1.1.2.
