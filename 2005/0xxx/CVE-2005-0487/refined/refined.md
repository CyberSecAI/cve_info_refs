- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `nav` parameter of the `index.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a victim's browser when they visit a page with the vulnerable parameter. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted URL. The `nav` parameter in the `index.php` script is used to inject code. Specifically, when the `_a=knowledgebase&_j=questiondetails&_i=2` actions are used, the `nav` parameter's value is rendered as a subheading.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a payload in the `nav` parameter and convince a victim to visit this URL.
