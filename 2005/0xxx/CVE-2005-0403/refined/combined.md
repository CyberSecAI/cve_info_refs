The fact is (I have several occurences of this event) that the parent's tty is allways the same as the child's when this event happens and no parent process (of the process that triggered this event) has triggered this event. Suggesting that current->tty pointer (or structure) gets garbled already in the running parent and then it is inherited by child which in turn calls init_dev and triggers this OOPS.  I am suspecting that the following is a race condition. In init_dev when re-opening an existing tty:          /* check whether we're reopening an existing tty */         tty = driver->table[idx];         if (tty) goto fast_track;  ... ...  fast_track:         if (test_bit(TTY_CLOSING, &tty->flags)) {                 retval = -EIO;                 goto end_init;         }         if (driver->type == TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_PTY &&             driver->subtype == PTY_TYPE_MASTER) {                 /*                  * special case for PTY masters: only one open permitted,                  * and the slave side open count is incremented as well.                  */                 if (atomic_read(&tty->count)) {                         retval = -EIO;                         goto end_init;                 }                 atomic_inc(&tty->link->count);         }         atomic_inc(&tty->count);         tty->driver = *driver; /* N.B. why do this every time?? */  success:   ... there's a test for the TTY_CLOSING bit in the flags and *after* this test there's a simple incrementing of count(s) and the init_dev succeeds. What if between testing for TTY_CLOSING bit and incrementing of count(s) some other task is executing the release_dev and finds the count droping to 0 and thus sets TTY_CLOSING bit (to late already) and releases the structure...  This could explain the garbled tty structure (already used by something else).  Since init_dev is already protecting it's main part by down_tty_sem/up_tty_sem calls, the same mutex could be used in release_dev:  *************** *** 1076,1082 ****   {         struct tty_struct *tty, *o_tty;         int     pty_master, tty_closing, o_tty_closing, do_sleep; !       int     idx;         char    buf[64];          tty = (struct tty_struct *)filp->private_data; --- 1118,1124 ----   {         struct tty_struct *tty, *o_tty;         int     pty_master, tty_closing, o_tty_closing, do_sleep; !       int     idx, o_idx;         char    buf[64];          tty = (struct tty_struct *)filp->private_data; *************** *** 1091,1096 **** --- 1133,1139 ----         pty_master = (tty->driver.type == TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_PTY &&                       tty->driver.subtype == PTY_TYPE_MASTER);         o_tty = tty->link; +       o_idx = o_tty?

This lock is taken upon opening a file, and tty_release also takes it. Thus, the scenario that you describe is not possible.   kill_pg, i blieve is sending a signal to an entire process group.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=144059#c7)  Wendy Cheng    2005-01-04 16:34:43 UTC  ``` The reason Jason's last patch makes sense (to me) is that, based on the dumps obtained from the customers (that matches with Peter's printk result in [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=144059#c5)), the memory that hosted the tty structure seems to get released and used for other purpose. In one of the dumps, it contained text data, except the tty->device field. If we check the code, the memory is released in do_tty_hangup()by fput():       916         set_bit(TTY_HUPPED, &tty->flags);     917         if(ld) {     918                 tty_ldisc_enable(tty);     919                 tty_ldisc_deref(ld);     920         }     921         unlock_kernel();     922         if (f)     923                 fput(f);     924 }  that also matched with the faulty script sent in by one of our customers where the script was piping the screen output to a text file (but I'm not able to recreate the issue using the very same script):  #!/bin/sh /usr/bin/iostat -d -x 60  2  >/usr/local/lotus/notesdata/Y8648038.TMP  I was working on a debug trace kernel that logged the entries between tty_open and hangup code and was plannning to do the zeroing of p->tty (#994-#995 in disassociate_ctty()) to earlier part of the routine until I saw Jason's patch.

It will become available in the main channel when U5 is officially released.  Either way, "up2date" is one of the ways to get the new kernel.    ```  [Comment 114](show_bug.cgi?id=144059#c114)  Ernie Petrides    2005-03-14 21:44:27 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 151086](show_bug.cgi?id=151086 "CLOSED ERRATA - kernel locks up tty/psuedo-tty access") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 115](show_bug.cgi?id=144059#c115)  Jason Baron    2005-03-17 22:08:22 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 150334](show_bug.cgi?id=150334 "CLOSED ERRATA - Kernel panic: Code: Bad EIP value") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 119](show_bug.cgi?id=144059#c119)  Ernie Petrides    2005-04-14 00:15:13 UTC  ``` A fix for this problem has also been committed to the RHEL3 E5 patch pool this evening (in kernel version 2.4.21-27.0.3.EL).    ```  [Comment 120](show_bug.cgi?id=144059#c120)  Eric Bursley    2005-04-22 14:37:26 UTC  ``` eric_bursley   ```  [Comment 121](show_bug.cgi?id=144059#c121)  Eric Bursley    2005-04-22 14:43:51 UTC  ``` We also have seen this problem with one of our customers, and if  possible would like a copy of the beta kernel for testing.   ```  [Comment 122](show_bug.cgi?id=144059#c122)  Mark J.
