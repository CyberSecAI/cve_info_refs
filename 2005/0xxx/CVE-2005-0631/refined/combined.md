 Vulnerable: PBLang 4.63 (and earlier?)

 ---

 General information:

 PBLang is an international BBS-software based on
PHP. It does not require any database but bases on a
flatfile system. Many professional features. More
info on the project website.

 ---

 Description:

 Anyone can delete anyone elses PM's as long as their
logged in (as any user, really, doesn't need to be
privileged). This could allow users to harass others
and other stuff... Well, wreck havoc!

 ---

 Proof Of Concept:

 <http://localhost/pblang/delpm.php?id=>[PMID]&a=[Target
user name]

 ---

 Fix and Vendor status:

 Vendor has been notified, expect official patch
soon.
