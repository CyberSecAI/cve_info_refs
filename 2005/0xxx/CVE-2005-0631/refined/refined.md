- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication in `delpm.php` allows any logged-in user to delete private messages (PMs) of other users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass. The application fails to properly verify if the logged-in user has the right to delete the specified PM.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users can delete other users' private messages, potentially leading to harassment and disruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP request to `delpm.php` with a target user name and the ID of the PM to delete.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a logged-in user of the PBLang application, no special privileges are required.
