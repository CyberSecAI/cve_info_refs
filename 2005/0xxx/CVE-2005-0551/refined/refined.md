- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to how the Client Server Runtime System (CSRSS) validates certain messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of messages by CSRSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the affected system. They would then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the machine with valid credentials. The attacker must be able to execute code on the targeted system.
