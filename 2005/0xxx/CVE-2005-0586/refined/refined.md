Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Suite handle the `Content-Disposition` header during file downloads. Specifically, the browser displays a file name and extension to the user based on the download link, but it is possible for a server to send a `Content-Disposition` header that specifies a different file extension for the downloaded file, while the user sees the original extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The main weakness is the discrepancy between the filename/extension presented to the user and the actual filename/extension given by the `Content-Disposition` header. This can be exploited by attackers to disguise malicious files as benign ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Users can be tricked into downloading and executing a malicious file that appears to be a harmless file such as a JPEG image. Since Windows hides file extensions by default, users may be unaware of the actual file extension, and double-clicking on the file could result in the execution of malware, rather than opening the file in a media application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves a malicious website that provides a download link with a benign-looking file extension (e.g., .jpg). When the user initiates the download, the webserver sends a `Content-Disposition` header that specifies a different, executable extension (e.g., .exe). The browser displays the benign extension during the download, but the file is saved with the executable extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to control a webserver or have the ability to inject a `Content-Disposition` header for a file they are serving to a user. They can accomplish this by hosting a malicious website or by compromising a legitimate site and injecting the malicious header into the response.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content from Mozilla explicitly mentions that this vulnerability is a "download dialog spoofing using `Content-Disposition` header".
- This advisory is specific to Firefox and Mozilla Suite.
- The advisory also notes a workaround of un-hiding file extensions on windows.
