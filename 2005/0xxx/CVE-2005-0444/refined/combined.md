| [Description](#c0)  Josiah Burroughs    2002-02-22 22:25:51 UTC  ``` console-tools was origionally an offset of kbd due to lack of updates to the kbd package.  It appears that things have changed and console-tools hasn't been updated in 2 years,  and kbd is the correct package to use.  kbd also has kbdrate which used to be in util-linux and was moved (feature request) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-04 10:05:09 UTC  ``` done. sys-apps/kbd ready and added to cvs. ``` |  |

# VMware Workstation: Untrusted library search path — GLSA **200502-18**

VMware may load shared libraries from an untrusted, world-writable
directory, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.5.2.8848-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.5.2.8848-r5**revision >= **3.2.1.2242-r4** |

### Background

VMware Workstation is a powerful virtual machine for developers and
system administrators.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team has discovered
that VMware Workstation searches for gdk-pixbuf loadable modules in an
untrusted, world-writable directory.

### Impact

A local attacker could create a malicious shared object that would be
loaded by VMware, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running VMware.

### Workaround

The system administrator may create the file /tmp/rrdharan to prevent
malicious users from creating a directory at that location:

`# touch /tmp/rrdharan`
### Resolution

All VMware Workstation users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-3.2.1.2242-r4"
```
