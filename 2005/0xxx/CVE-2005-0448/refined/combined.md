How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Perl: rmtree and DBI tmpfile vulnerabilities — GLSA **200501-38**

The Perl DBI library and File::Path::rmtree function are vulnerable to
symlink attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-perl/DBI** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.38** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.37-r1**>= **1.38-r1** |

| Package | **dev-lang/perl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **5.8.6-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.8.6-r4**revision >= **5.8.5-r5**revision >= **5.8.4-r4**revision >= **5.8.2-r4** |

### Background

Perl is a cross platform programming language. The DBI is the standard
database interface module for Perl.

### Description

Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pena discovered that the DBI library creates
temporary files in an insecure, predictable way (CAN-2005-0077). Paul
Szabo found out that "File::Path::rmtree" is vulnerable to various race
conditions (CAN-2004-0452, CAN-2005-0448).

### Impact

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory that point to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
the DBI library or File::Path::rmtree is executed, this could be used
to overwrite or remove files with the rights of the user calling these
functions.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All Perl users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-lang/perl
```

All DBI library users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-perl/DBI
```

March 22nd, 2005                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : perl
Vulnerability  : design flaw
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0448
Debian Bug     : 286905 286922

Paul Szabo discovered another vulnerability in the File::Path::rmtree
function of perl, the popular scripting language.  When a process is
deleting a directory tree, a different user could exploit a race
condition to create setuid binaries in this directory tree, provided
that he already had write permissions in any subdirectory of that
tree.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.1-8.9.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.8.4-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
