{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A security audit of the MediaWiki project discovered multiple vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
    "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)",
    "Insufficient sanitization of input parameters in image deletion code, leading to directory traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could hijack sessions and authentication cookies to inject malicious script code that will be executed in a user's browser session in context of the vulnerable site, or use JavaScript submitted forms to perform restricted actions. An authenticated administrator could delete arbitrary files via directory traversal.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Tricking a user to load a carefully crafted URL",
    "Use of JavaScript submitted forms",
        "Exploiting the image deletion flaw with directory traversal."
    ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker, and authenticated administrator for image deletion flaw."
