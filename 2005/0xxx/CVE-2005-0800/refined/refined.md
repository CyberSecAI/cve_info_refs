```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `install.php` script in mcNews includes a file specified by the user-controlled `l` parameter without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Arbitrary file inclusion vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a remote PHP file, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Attack vectors: By sending a crafted HTTP request to `admin/install.php` with the `l` parameter pointing to a malicious PHP file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a web server hosting their malicious PHP file.
