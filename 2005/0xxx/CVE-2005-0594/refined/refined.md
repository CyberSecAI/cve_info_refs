- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking on command-line arguments passed to the `NeST` tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists when processing the `-target` command-line parameter with an overly long string.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `NeST` process, potentially gaining root access because `NeST` executes with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: By supplying the `-target` command-line parameter with an overly long string, a local user can trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user with the ability to execute commands.
