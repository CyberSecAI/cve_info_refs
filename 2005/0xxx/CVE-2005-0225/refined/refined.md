Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0225:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from FireHOL creating temporary files with predictable names insecurely.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure temporary file creation: The application creates temporary files with predictable names.
- Symlink attack: The predictable names of temporary files can be targeted using symlinks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local attacker can create malicious symbolic links to arbitrary system files. When FireHOL is executed, these symlinks would cause the application to overwrite files with the privileges of the user launching FireHOL, typically root. This can lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or arbitrary file modification by a local user.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access is required. An attacker must be able to create files, including symlinks, on the local file system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user account
- Ability to create symlinks within the file system.
- Ability to execute the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes**
- The gentoo.org content provides more context than the official CVE description, detailing the symlink attack and its consequences.
- The secunia.com content does not provide any vulnerability information but describes their service.
- The bugs.gentoo.org content is a bug report for a different package (xdialog) and not related to the CVE.
