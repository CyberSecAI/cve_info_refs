# FireHOL: Insecure temporary file creation — GLSA **200502-01**

FireHOL is vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially allowing a local user
to overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-firewall/firehol** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.224** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.224** |

### Background

FireHOL is an iptables rules generator.

### Description

FireHOL insecurely creates temporary files with predictable names.

### Impact

A local attacker could create malicious symbolic links to arbitrary
system files. When FireHOL is executed, this could lead to these files
being overwritten with the rights of the user launching FireHOL,
usually the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FireHOL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-firewall/firehol-1.224"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Seemant Kulleen    2002-02-21 01:03:49 UTC  ``` Hello again to my Gentoo friends,  Here is an ebuild for xdialog, which is designed as a drop-in replacement for cdialog.  It puts dialog based things in a nice GTK interface, and uses trees in the directory display, making it visually more appealing than dialog in a term.  Thing is, the project homepage seems to be down (I have e-mailed the author about that), so currently the SOURCE_URI points to Debian's repository for its unstable branch.  Also, it is my feeling that most packages in Gentoo are lowercased.  That's why I named this xdialog instead of Xdialog.  And that's why I set a P= in the ebuild itself.  If I am wrong about that, then this package really should be named Xdialog instead, and the P= can be removed. When I hear from the author I will make a note in this bug report.  Thanks again,  Seemant ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Seemant Kulleen    2002-02-21 01:04:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 221](attachment.cgi?id=221 "Xdialog  ebuild file") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=221&action=edit "Xdialog  ebuild file")] Xdialog  ebuild file ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-21 14:02:58 UTC  ``` just set S as follows: S=${WORKDIR}/Xdialog-${PV} Then remove the P definition which shouldn't be there.  Resubmit this and I'll forward it to someone. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Seemant Kulleen    2002-02-21 16:06:02 UTC  ``` Hello Again,  As per Dr. Robbins' instruction, I have adjusted the ebuild file to remove P= and change the S=.  Note to Dr. Robbins: thank you for having me do that myself, because now that is in my head.  I have run across that issue several times, and I finally realised how to fix it.  I appreciate you letting me learn :)  Thanks,  Seemant  ---- cut here   # Copyright 1999-2002 Gentoo Technologies, Inc. # Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, v2 or later # Author: Seemant Kulleen <seemant@rocketmail.com> # $Header$  S=${WORKDIR}/Xdialog-${PV} DESCRIPTION="A drop-in replacement for cdialog.

This guy's ebuild still doesn't show up. The ebuild can be cleaned up a bit.  The compile and install routines are simple, although he does check for nls which is good.  src_compile() {    econf  || die "configure fail"    emake || die }  src_install () {    make DESTDIR=${D} install || die } ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-25 02:10:12 UTC  ``` it's finally in portage, folks. ``` |  |
