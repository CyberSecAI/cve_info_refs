| [Description](#c0)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 02:53:38 UTC  ``` When you grant privileges to databases with underscore character in their name via  phpMyAdmin, you end up with user having wildcard privileges like in [Bug 83163](show_bug.cgi?id=83163 "RESOLVED INVALID - dev-db/mysql-4.0.22-r2 enables any user to create database without having the required privileges").   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create test_db 2. Create user test 3. Click on "Privileges" - Select user test 4. On next screen select test_db in "Add privileges on the following database" drop-down menu 5. On "Edit Privileges" screen check all fields except GRANT and click on "Go"  Actual Results:   You have updated the privileges for 'test'@'localhost'. SQL-query:  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `test_db` . * TO 'test'@'localhost';  Now the user has wildcard privileges and can create databases as described in [Bug 83163](show_bug.cgi?id=83163 "RESOLVED INVALID - dev-db/mysql-4.0.22-r2 enables any user to create database without having the required privileges") when he logs into MySQL.  Expected Results:   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `test\_db` . * TO 'test'@'localhost';  This is inconsistent and insecure behaviour because phpMyAdmin grants wildcard privileges while it is expected not to do so. You therefore cannot grant privileges to databases with underscored names via phpMyAdmin GUI. The only viable option it to use SQL statement on mysql database instead. This defeats one of the main purposes of using GUI for MySQL administration.   phpMyAdmin should escape underscore character in database name when granting rights on database level but this behaviour was probably broken when fixing the [bug 6](show_bug.cgi?id=6 "RESOLVED FIXED - ReportLab-1.11.ebuild")b mentioned at <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1056706&group_id=23067&atid=377408> (which was dealing with error when granting permissions on table level) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 03:15:44 UTC  ``` Apparently fixed in upstream : <http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/phpmyadmin/phpMyAdmin/server_privileges.php?r1=2.40&r2=2.42>  Reporter: please try to apply patch and check it fixes the problem. twp: we might need a new bump before releasing GLSA :) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 03:29:59 UTC  ``` Affirmative, captain. ;-)   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `test\_db` . * TO 'test'@'localhost';  Now I can finally have some sleep. Thank you very much! ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tom Payne (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 04:52:49 UTC  ``` Martin (mholzer)  --  Could you bump this please? I won't have time to look at this until Monday evening at the earliest. Could you take maintainership of phpmyadmin?  Cheers,  Tom ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Aaron Walker (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 06:48:40 UTC  ``` 2.6.1_p2-r1 is in cvs, stable x86.  CC'd archs please stable. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 08:24:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 52466](attachment.cgi?id=52466 "failed patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=52466&action=edit "failed patch")] failed patch  This patch does not work - see attachment   * Applying 2.6.1_p2-no-wildcard-privs-for-you.patch ...   * Failed Patch: 2.6.1_p2-no-wildcard-privs-for-you.patch!  *  * Include in your bugreport the contents of:  *  *   /var/tmp/portage/phpmyadmin-2.6.1_p2-r1/temp/2.6.1_p2-no-wildcard-privs-for-you.patch-32018.out ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 08:30:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 52467](attachment.cgi?id=52467 "working patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=52467&action=edit "working patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=52467&action=diff "working patch")] working patch  Note the redundant path phpmyadmin/phpMyAdmin/ was stripped. ;-) ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 08:32:31 UTC  ``` Also note that the post-install instructions are now wrong again (version changed)  1. Update MySQL's grant tables and the pmadb database:      mysql -u root -p < /usr/share/webapps/phpmyadmin/2.6.1_p2/sqlscripts/mysql/2.6.1_p2_create.sql ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 09:27:57 UTC  ``` Aaron: patch fails, see above ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Aaron Walker (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 09:58:10 UTC  ``` Actually it has nothing to do with the patch.  As I originally thought it's due to the $Id: $ change in the source file.  cvs see's this and automatically updates the timestamp, thus causing the patch to fail.  I've had to patch the sources then change the $Id back then re-diff ;)  Fixed.  I've also updated the ebuild to automatically update the postinst-en.txt file that gets installed so that PVR is set correctly. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Aaron Walker (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 09:59:06 UTC  ``` err s/patch/paths/ ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 10:56:15 UTC  ``` OK, it works now. :-) ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 11:52:50 UTC  ``` Arches, please mark latest stable ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Michael Hanselmann (hansmi) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 13:44:34 UTC  ``` Stable on ppc. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Jan Brinkmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 14:05:56 UTC  ``` stable on amd64 ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-02 18:09:36 UTC  ``` Stable on SPARC. ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-03 07:05:24 UTC  ``` Stable on alpha. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-03 14:27:01 UTC  ``` GLSA 200503-07 ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Alexander M.

| [Description](#c0)  Aarni Honka    2005-02-24 07:22:51 UTC  ``` TITLE: phpMyAdmin Local File Inclusion and Cross-Site Scripting  SECUNIA ADVISORY ID: SA14382  VERIFY ADVISORY: <http://secunia.com/advisories/14382/>  CRITICAL: Moderately critical  IMPACT: Cross Site Scripting, Exposure of sensitive information  WHERE: >From remote  SOFTWARE: phpMyAdmin 2.x <http://secunia.com/product/1720/> phpMyAdmin 1.x <http://secunia.com/product/1719/>  DESCRIPTION: Maksymilian Arciemowicz has reported some vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and disclose sensitive information.  1) Input passed to the "strServer", "cfg[BgcolorOne]", and "strServerChoice" parameters in "select_server.lib.php", the "bgcolor" and "row_no" parameters in "display_tbl_links.lib.php", the "left_font_family" parameter in "theme_left.css.php", and the "right_font_family" parameter in "theme_right.css.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to users. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.  2) Input passed to the "GLOBALS[cfg][ThemePath]" parameter in "phpmyadmin.css.php" and "cfg[Server][extension]" parameter in "database_interface.lib.php" is not properly verified before being used to include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local resources.  Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled and that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

# phpMyAdmin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-07**

phpMyAdmin contains multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to command
execution, XSS issues and bypass of security restrictions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/phpmyadmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6.1\_p2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6.1\_p2-r1** |

### Background

phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
administration of MySQL databases from a web-browser.

### Description

phpMyAdmin contains several security issues:

* Maksymilian Arciemowicz has discovered multiple variable injection
  vulnerabilities that can be exploited through "$cfg" and "GLOBALS"
  variables and localized strings
* It is possible to force phpMyAdmin to disclose information in error
  messages
* Failure to correctly escape special characters

### Impact

By sending a specially-crafted request, an attacker can include and
execute arbitrary PHP code or cause path information disclosure.
Furthermore the XSS issue allows an attacker to inject malicious script
code, potentially compromising the victim's browser. Lastly the
improper escaping of special characters results in unintended privilege
settings for MySQL.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.1_p2-r1"
```
