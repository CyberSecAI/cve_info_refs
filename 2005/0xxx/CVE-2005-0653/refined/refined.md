The provided content relates to CVE-2005-0653.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from phpMyAdmin not properly escaping underscore characters in database names when granting privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrectly grants wildcard privileges on databases with underscores in their name.
- Specifically, when granting privileges to a database named `test_db`, the SQL query generated by phpMyAdmin is `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test_db . * TO 'user'@'localhost';` instead of the correct `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test\_db . * TO 'user'@'localhost';`. This results in the user having wildcard privileges, effectively granting them access to all databases.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unintended wildcard privileges on the MySQL server. This allows the attacker to create, modify, or delete databases as if they had unrestricted access.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the phpMyAdmin web interface when an administrator attempts to grant privileges to a database that has an underscore in its name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the phpMyAdmin interface, and be able to grant database privileges, meaning the attacker would need administrator access to phpMyAdmin.
