Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Lack of Backend Authorization Checking:** The core issue is that the Webseries Payment Application does not perform proper authorization checks on the backend. While the application's menu might restrict access to certain privileged operations, these operations are still executable by directly accessing their corresponding URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References:** The application allows direct access to privileged functionalities via URLs, bypassing the intended access controls.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:**  The system fails to verify if a user has the necessary permissions to execute specific actions, allowing any authenticated user to perform any available action regardless of their assigned rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user can gain administrative rights.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:**  An attacker can access sensitive information like user entitlements, including a list of privileged users.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Users can perform any function within the application, including creating new admin users, modifying security groups, and approving payments of unlimited value.
*  **Financial Loss:**  Two colluding unprivileged users can submit and approve payments, potentially leading to financial fraud.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by directly accessing the URLs of privileged operations, bypassing the standard menu-driven interface.
*   **Form Submission:** Using a crafted HTML form, an attacker can send POST requests to the server with modified parameters to execute administrative actions such as creating new admin users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user of the Webseries Payment Application. No specific privilege is required initially.
*   **Knowledge of URLs:** The attacker needs to know or discover the URLs for the privileged operations they want to execute. This could be through reconnaissance or prior knowledge of the system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory notes that an approval system is in place, preventing a user from approving their own changes. However, two colluding unprivileged users can bypass this limitation.
*   The advisory includes a sample HTML form that can be used to exploit the vulnerability by creating a new admin user via a POST request to `SaveUser.asp`.
