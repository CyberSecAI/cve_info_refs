**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Software:** Ublog reload versions 1.0.4 and prior.
*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper sanitization of user input in the "msg" parameter within the `login.asp` page.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The default database file `ublogreload.mdb` is located within the web root, making it publicly accessible.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **XSS:** Input validation failure, allowing injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript.
    *   **Insecure storage:** Storing the database file in a publicly accessible web directory.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML or scripts into the webpage viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can download the database file, potentially gaining access to user credentials (including the admin's hashed password).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **XSS:** Crafted URL with malicious script injected into the `msg` parameter of `login.asp`.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Direct access to the database file using its URL, such as `/mdb-database/ublogreload.mdb`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **XSS:** The attacker needs to entice a victim to click a maliciously crafted URL.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** No special privileges are required; the attacker only needs to know the location of the database file within the web root.

**Technical Details:**

*   The XSS vulnerability is triggered when the `login.asp` page displays the value of the "msg" parameter without sanitization.
*   The database file `ublogreload.mdb` contained in `mdb-database` folder is accessible via web browser.

**Solution:**

*   Upgrade to Ublog reload version 1.0.5.
