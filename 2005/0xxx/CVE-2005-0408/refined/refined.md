- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses a hardcoded string "boogaadeeboo" as a salt in the MD5 hash generation for user authentication cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Predictable authentication mechanism based on a constant, hardcoded salt.
    - Lack of proper user-specific or installation-specific salt.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and gain full control of the CitrusDB application, leading to potential corruption of the database and sensitive customer information.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation via HTTP requests by setting crafted cookies.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know or guess a valid username (e.g., "admin") and be able to make HTTP requests to the application.
