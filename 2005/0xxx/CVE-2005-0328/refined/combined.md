Hi!

I have discovered a serious problem with the following routers:
Zyxel P310, P314, P324 and Netgaear RT311, RT314 all with the latest firmware \
available as of 2005-01-20. I think that the problem is present in all routers using \
Zynos, but I am not sure.

Let say you have a Computer with IP: 192.168.0.50 connected to the WAN side of a \
router that has 192.168.1.1 on WAN and 192.168.0.1 on the LAN side. If I send a ping \
to 192.168.0.1 (LAN on router) then I get request timed out, but if I look in my arp \
cache I will see this:

192.168.0.1 xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx

where xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx is the mac address of the WAN side. So the result must be \
that if I send a packet with the same destination IP as the routers LAN IP, I will \
get an ARP reply from the WAN side. This can be used to get information about which \
IP adresses are used on the LAN side when you are sitting on the WAN side. It is also \
possible to pollute the ARP cache on your ISPs equipment by changing the IP adress on \
your lan side.

Zyxels response to this is that we have choosen the wrong equipment (I agree :-) they \
told me to use VLAN as a workaround.

/Jens
