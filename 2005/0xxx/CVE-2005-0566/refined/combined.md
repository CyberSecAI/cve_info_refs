## Golden FTP server contains a buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#620862

Original Release Date: 2005-02-25 | Last Revised: 2005-02-25

---

### Overview

Golden FTP server contains a buffer overflow that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| [Golden FTP](http://www.goldenftpserver.com/) server is a personal FTP server for the Microsoft Windows platform. The RNTO (rename to) command is used in conjunction with the RNFR (rename from) to rename a file on the server. Specifically, RNFR is used to specify the current name of the file, and RNTO is used to specify the new name for the file. If a remote unauthenticated attacker sends a specially crafted rename request (RNFR and RNTO) to a vulnerable Golden FTP server, they may be able to trigger a buffer overflow vulnerability in the routine that handles RNTO commands.  Please note that an exploit for this vulnerability is publicly available. |

### Impact
