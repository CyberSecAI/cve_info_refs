Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Alt-N WebAdmin <= 3.0.2:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `useredit_account.wdm` file does not properly sanitize user input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL with a malicious script in the `user` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince a user to click on the malicious link.

2.  **User Account Editing Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `useredit_account.wdm` script lacks proper validation to restrict access to other user accounts.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate authorization checks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An authenticated user can modify the settings of other users by manipulating the `user` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of user account settings. The degree of modification is tied to the permissions of the user performing the attack (i.e., they can only modify fields they themselves can modify).
    *    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.

3.  **HTML Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `modalfram.wdm` file allows loading arbitrary web pages.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure inclusion of external content.
    *  **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL that loads an attacker-controlled page using the `file` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can make external content look like it is part of the WebAdmin server.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince a user to click on the malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities do not directly enable privilege escalation on the server.
*   The vendor was notified and released a patch on December 14, 2004.
*   The XSS and HTML Injection vulnerabilities can be triggered without needing a user to be logged in while the user account editing vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated.
