- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RUMBA application does not properly validate length values within profile files, leading to buffer overflows when copying data from these files. It trusts the length values calculated or supplied within the profile files, without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Specifically, the application lacks the ability to safely copy values out of the profile file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of these buffer overflows could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when loading a specially crafted profile file (.RTO, .WPA) into RUMBA. The attacker needs to create a malicious profile file with oversized values that will cause a buffer overflow when parsed by the RUMBA application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted profile file to be loaded by the RUMBA application.
