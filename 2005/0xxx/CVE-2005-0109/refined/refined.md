  "CVE-2005-0109": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "This vulnerability allows local users to potentially leak sensitive information by analyzing shared memory cache evictions on systems with simultaneous multithreading (SMT), such as Intel's Hyper-Threading Technology (HTT).",
    "details": [
      {
        "weaknesses": [
          "Shared memory cache between logical processors in SMT architectures.",
          "Lack of thread-aware cache eviction logic allowing a malicious thread to influence the cache state of another thread.",
           "Vulnerability to cache-timing attacks due to non-constant memory access patterns."
        ],
        "impact": "Sensitive information, including cryptographic keys, can be leaked to local users.",
         "attack_vectors": [
           "Local access to a system with SMT enabled.",
           "Ability to run code capable of performing cache eviction analysis."
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "Local user with the ability to execute code on the affected system."
      },
        {
        "root_cause": "Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) allows multiple threads to share the same processor resources including cache memory. By monitoring cache evictions, a malicious process can infer information about operations of another process running concurrently on a logical processor." ,
        "impact": "Stealing of cryptographic keys, specifically RSA private keys as demonstrated. Other sensitive information could also be exposed.",
           "attack_vectors": [
           "Co-execution of attacker-controlled thread on the same physical core as victim thread using SMT. ",
           "Monitoring cache access patterns via timing analysis. "
        ],
           "required_capabilities": "Malicious user to run code on the same machine, as the victim thread that's doing some cryptographic operations, with the help of shared resources (caches) and timing analysis."
      }
    ],
    "remediation": [
      "Disabling simultaneous multithreading/HTT at the OS or BIOS level.",
       "Operating system schedulers should avoid scheduling threads from different security contexts on the same physical core when SMT is enabled.",
       "Cryptographic libraries should be rewritten to avoid data-dependent or key-dependent memory access or code path patterns. "
