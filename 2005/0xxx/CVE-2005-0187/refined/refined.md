Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `SetSkin()` method of the AtHoc Toolbar's ActiveX component is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when an overly long 'skin name' is provided as input, exceeding the buffer's capacity.
*   **Format String Bug:** The `SetBaseURL()` function, when provided with an invalid URL, logs the URL to a debug file. This logging process is vulnerable to a format string attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** A classic buffer overflow vulnerability in the `SetSkin()` method.
*   **Format String Vulnerability:** A format string vulnerability when logging the base URL in the debug file through the `SetBaseURL()` method.
*   **ActiveX Control Marked Safe for Scripting:** The vulnerable ActiveX component is marked as "safe for scripting," allowing for easy exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Both the buffer overflow and the format string vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. Attackers can overwrite return addresses, function pointers, and other critical memory locations.
*   **Full System Compromise:** By gaining arbitrary code execution, an attacker can potentially take full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Webpage:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited through a specially crafted webpage that contains malicious code to interact with the vulnerable ActiveX control.
*   **User Browsing:** The user must browse to the malicious webpage using Internet Explorer with the vulnerable AtHoc toolbar installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious webpage:** The attacker must be able to create and host a webpage designed to exploit the toolbar's vulnerabilities.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must visit the malicious webpage using a vulnerable version of the AtHoc toolbar installed in Internet Explorer.
