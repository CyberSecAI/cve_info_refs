    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Inadequate input validation and filtering of user-supplied URLs.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain access to arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to system compromise or further avenues of attack. The service can also be crashed leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending specially crafted HTTP requests through the proxy service, an attacker can perform directory traversal attacks and cause a denial of service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable proxy service, typically via network access."
