Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-0141 (Based on the provided advisory from mozilla.org)

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Mozilla Firefox and Suite handle links with custom getters and `toString` methods.  Specifically, the `CheckLoadURI` function, designed to prevent web content from accessing local files or "chrome" URIs, could be bypassed when a user middle-clicked or control-clicked a specially crafted link to open it in a new tab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Security Checks:** The core issue is that the check intended to prevent loading of local files/chrome URLs can be circumvented via the manipulation of a link's `href` property.
*   **Custom Getter Manipulation:**  The `link.href` property could be set to an object with a custom `toString()` method that returned different values at different times.  This allowed the initial check by the browser to pass, but a different (malicious) URI would be used when opening the link in a new tab.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Access (limited):** While the vulnerability allowed for bypassing checks and potentially loading local files, the browser's same-origin policy prevented the attacker's content from actually reading the file contents or manipulating privileged chrome (i.e. the browser's own UI).
*   **Chrome URI Loading:** Attackers could potentially load chrome URIs, which could be used to manipulate the browser UI or access other privileged functionalities, however, the same-origin policy prevents the attacker from manipulating the UI.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Content:** An attacker could embed the specially crafted link with custom getters and a dynamic `toString()` method on a web page.
*   **User Interaction:** The user has to middle-click or control-click the crafted link to open it in a new tab.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server:**  The attacker needs to host a web page with the malicious link.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to trick the user into middle-clicking or control-clicking a link to open it in a new tab.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report on Bugzilla (bug 249332) provides more context, showing the technical details of the fix.
*   The fix involved using `XPCNativeWrapper()` to ensure the browser was getting the correct `href` value and not a manipulated version.
*   Several parts of the code related to link handling were modified to prevent exploitation of this flaw, including modifications to the `linkURL`, `linkText` and other functions used when handling clicks.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 1 and Mozilla Suite 1.7.5.
