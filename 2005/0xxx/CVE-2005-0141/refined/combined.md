# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-01

## Link opened in new tab can load a local file

Announced
January 21, 2005
Reporter
Jesse Ruderman
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.5

### Description

Links with a custom getter and toString method can bypass checks intended to
prevent web content from linking to local files and "chrome" URIs if the user
can be convinced to middle-click (or control-click) to open it in a new tab.
The browser's "same-origin" policy prevents the attacker's content from taking
advantage of this flaw to read the local file or manipulate privileged chrome.

### Workaround

Turn off javascript or upgrade to fixed version

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=249332#c0)• 21 years ago |
|  | |

A page can make a link that, when middle-clicked, opens a chrome URL in a new tab.
Chrome JavaScript first sends link.href to CheckLoadURI, then uses it to open a
tab. In the exploit, link.href is an object with a toString function that
returns different values depending on how many times it has been called.
The script uses a custom href getter to make the chrome JavaScript see link.href
as an object. link.href can't \*be\* an object because there is a standard href
setter for link elements.

[Use XPCNativeWrapper() to ensure we're getting the right href.](attachment.cgi?id=162225&action=diff) (obsolete)

This fixes this bug, and probably others, but who knows if I caught all of
them. There's a lot of JS code here, and probably elsewhere too, that may very
well suffer from this same problem :(

If you were worred about this.link.ref, we also need to be worried about
this.link.getAttributeNS() since that can be overriden just as easily.

I think its probably best to make this function call linkURL() if we can't get
any attribute text (though we may also want to add wrappers for the
getAttribute() calls, since they can be spoofed as well -- just not exploited).

Might as well wrap getAttribute while we're at it here, too.

Maybe create the wrapper unconditionally before the if since all three branches
above use it, at least for title? 2 of 3 use the getAttribute so maybe just
use it unconditionally anyway.

And I think linkNode.parentNode, else someone could return a random object with
a bogus getAttributeNS. Yes, this whole thing sucks. We really need to have
something in XPConnect to handle this shit better, i.e. if in chrome reading
content, it should call native methods when we have them.

This doesn't fix Mozilla though. That one might be in contentAreaClick.js, let
me try it.

The link text can be set by the the page to anything it wants, so nothing to
protect against there.

That code is so bogus that I didn't bother :)

that's fine, as long as we follow the link we get the href for here, which I
believe we do.

Yah. But not for 1.0.
Fixed the rest, I think.

Agreed, I noted there wasn't an exploit, but it would be good to use the same
code path when they both try and do the same thing.
The rest looks cool, though I have a small concern that all the places are
caught in the seamonkey side (there is considerable more firefox patch than
seamonkey patch). But I'll trust you here.

Yeah, fair enough, I changed that code to use a wrapper as well, and fixed a bug
where it was getting an xlink attribute of itself in stead of the link :)
