  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The SocialMPN application is vulnerable to remote file inclusion due to an insecure way of handling user-provided input in the 'modules.php' script.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious URL, specifying a remote file path in the 'name' parameter of 'modules.php'. The application then includes this file, resulting in code execution."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application and must have a web server where the malicious code is hosted."
  },
  "technical_details": {
    "vulnerable_url": "http://$target/modules.php?name=$xploit&file=article&sid=2",
    "exploitation_method": "The provided Perl script exploits the vulnerability by sending a GET request to the vulnerable URL, with the 'name' parameter set to the attacker-controlled file path. The script then checks for a 'HTTP/1.0 200 OK' response to confirm the success of the inclusion.",
      "additional_notes": "The exploit script adds a '?' at the end of the file inclusion path for an apparent trick."
