- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A crash of the server caused by accessing a wrong memory zone after handling a large `cl_guid` value sent by the client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of the size of the `cl_guid` value leading to an out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote server crash.
- **Attack vectors:** A client sends a large `cl_guid` value to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the game server, but does not necessarily need to be authenticated (password protected servers are also vulnerable).
