Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the insecure handling of temporary files and directories by both the `OpenMosixView` and `OpenMosixCollector` components of the OpenMosix software suite. Specifically, the applications create files and directories in `/tmp` with predictable names and without proper checks, making them susceptible to symlink attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Temporary File Creation in OpenMosixView:**
    *   `OpenMosixView` creates a temporary file named `/tmp/nodes.tmp` to store node information obtained from the `mosctl` command. This file is created without checking if it already exists, allowing a local attacker to pre-create it as a symlink.

2.  **Insecure Temporary Directory Creation in OpenMosixCollector:**
    *   `OpenMosixCollector` creates a directory `/tmp/openmosixcollector` and several files within it at startup, including `cluster`, `sync.count`, and a subdirectory `phist`. The names and locations of these files/directories are predictable, creating a race condition.
    *   The daemon creates backup directories in `/tmp` using a predictable name structure (`${OMCTDIR}_[date]`) every 12 hours, which is also vulnerable to symlink attacks.

3. **Symlink Vulnerability:**
    * By creating a symlink with the same name as the temporary files/directories that the applications create, an attacker can redirect file writes to arbitrary locations on the filesystem, leading to potential corruption or overwriting of critical files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Overwrite/Deletion:** A local attacker can overwrite or delete arbitrary files on the system by pre-creating symlinks to the targeted files or directories. This can lead to system instability, data loss, and denial of service.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** While not explicitly demonstrated, overwriting certain system files could potentially lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** In the exploit example provided, symlinking to `/etc/shadow` and other sensitive files is used to demonstrate how an attacker could potentially obtain sensitive data.
*  **System Corruption:** If the temporary directory is created by a normal user, `OpenMosixCollector` will overwrite the content, leading to corruption of the files that were symlinked.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attack involves creating symlinks at specific locations within the filesystem.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to time the creation of symlinks to coincide with the execution or restart of `OpenMosixView` or `OpenMosixCollector`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system with the ability to create files and directories in `/tmp`
*   The attacker must know the predictable names of the temporary files and directories being created by the vulnerable applications.

**Additional Notes**

*   The advisory indicates the vendor has been notified but a fix might take time due to architecture changes for OpenMosix on 2.6 kernels.
*   The provided exploit script (`RX_OMcollector_proof.sh`) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability in both `OpenMosixView` and `OpenMosixCollector`.
* The vulnerability is present in OpenMosixView version 1.5 and potentially earlier versions.
