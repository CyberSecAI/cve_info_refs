Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in MercuryBoard 1.1.1:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of input validation for the `$num` variable in `global.php`.  Specifically, the code performs a division operation where `$num` can be controlled by user input. When a zero or non-numerical value is provided for `$num`, a division-by-zero error occurs, revealing the full server path in the error message.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient input sanitization and error handling.
    *   **Impact:** Exposes the server's file system structure to attackers, potentially aiding in more targeted attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a 'n' parameter set to 0.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special privileges needed, an attacker can send a crafted GET request.
    *   **Additional FPD URLs:** Multiple other PHP files are directly accessible, exposing their paths, including files in the `lib/jpgraph/`, `admincp/`, and `func/` directories.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization when handling the `s`, `l`, and `a` parameters in `pm.php`, `members.php`, and `index.php`, respectively. The application directly incorporates these parameters into the HTML output without escaping or sanitizing.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper handling of user input; application does not encode user-controlled data before rendering to the browser.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, allowing them to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other client-side attacks within the context of a user's browser session.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted HTTP GET requests with malicious JavaScript code in the `s`, `l`, or `a` parameters.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special privileges needed. An attacker can inject malicious scripts via GET requests.
    *   **Additional XSS Vectors:** XSS is also possible via the `to` and `re` parameters when `a=pm&s=send` is used. Additional XSS is possible when `a=post` is used, especially in the parameters `s` and `t`, and also via the `s` parameter when `a=cp` is used.
3.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The same lack of input sanitization that leads to XSS vulnerabilities also makes SQL injection possible. The application does not properly validate or escape user input passed to SQL queries, making it vulnerable to attacks where SQL syntax is injected through URL parameters
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation; direct injection of user-controlled data in the SQL query.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially gain access to the database, retrieve sensitive data (like user credentials), or modify data, potentially compromising the integrity of the application.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting SQL syntax into parameters such as `t` in requests to `index.php?a=post&s=reply`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires administrator login to be critical, however an attacker can try to get sensitive data via this vulnerability.
    *   **Additional Details:** The specific example given returns an error due to a column count mismatch, however, it shows that the SQL injection vector is indeed working.

**Patch:**

The vulnerabilities were fixed in MercuryBoard version 1.1.2.

**CVE Relevance:**

While the provided text doesn't explicitly mention the CVE ID, the vulnerabilities described are typical of the types covered by CVEs. Based on the description, it is very likely that this content relates to CVE-2005-0307, although it would be ideal to have the official CVE description to confirm. The content reveals multiple vulnerabilities (FPD, XSS, SQLi) which is useful for the context of the CVE.
