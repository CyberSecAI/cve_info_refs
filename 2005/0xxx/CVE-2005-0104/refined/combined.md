# SquirrelMail: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200501-39**

SquirrelMail fails to properly sanitize user input, which could lead to
arbitrary code execution and compromise webmail accounts.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/squirrelmail** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.4.3a-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.4** |

### Background

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. It supports IMAP
and SMTP and can optionally be installed with SQL support.

### Description

SquirrelMail fails to properly sanitize certain strings when
decoding specially-crafted strings, which can lead to PHP file
inclusion and XSS.

* Insufficient checking of incoming URLs
  in prefs.php (CAN-2005-0075) and in webmail.php (CAN-2005-0103).
* Insufficient escaping of integers in webmail.php
  (CAN-2005-0104).

### Impact

By sending a specially-crafted URL, an attacker can execute
arbitrary code from the local system with the permissions of the web
server. Furthermore by enticing a user to load a specially-crafted URL,
it is possible to display arbitrary remote web pages in Squirrelmail's
frameset and execute arbitrary scripts running in the context of the
victim's browser. This could lead to a compromise of the user's webmail
account, cookie theft, etc.

### Workaround

The arbitrary code execution is only possible with
"register\_globals" set to "On". Gentoo ships PHP with
"register\_globals" set to "Off" by default. There are no known
workarounds for the other issues at this time.

### Resolution

All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.4"
```

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.

SquirrelMail Security Advisory
==============================

SquirrelMail 1.4.4 has been released to resolve a number of security
issues disclosed below.  It is strongly recommended that all running
SquirrelMail prior to 1.4.4 upgrade to the latest release.

Remote File Inclusion
---------------------
Manoel Zaninetti reported an issue in src/webmail.php which would allow a
crafted URL to include a remote web page.  This was assigned CAN-2005-0103
by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.

Cross Site Scripting Issues
---------------------------
A possible cross site scripting issue exists in src/webmail.php that is
only accessible when the PHP installation is running with register_globals
set to On.  This issue was uncovered internally by the SquirrelMail
Development team. This isssue was assigned CAN-2005-0104 by the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures.

A second issue which was resolved in the 1.4.4-rc1 release was uncovered
and assigned CAN-2004-1036 by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.
This issue could allow a remote user to send a specially crafted header
and cause execution of script (such as javascript) in the client browser.

Local File Inclusion
--------------------
A possible local file inclusion issue was uncovered by one of our
developers involving custom preference handlers.  This issue is only
active if the PHP installation is running with register_globals set to On.

It is strongly suggested that all users running SquirrelMail prior to
1.4.4 upgrade to the latest release.  Those using a development release,
should upgrade to the latest snapshots to ensure they have the latest
updates for these issues.  A full list of changes in this, and previous
releases can be found here (<http://www.squirrelmail.org/changelog.php>).

For further updates on security issues, details are posted to
<http://www.squirrelmail.org/security/>.  Any security issues should be
emailed to security@squirrelmail.org.

We'd like to express thanks for those that have worked with us on getting
security issues resolved with SquirrelMail, and hope that people continue
to do so in such fashion, it is much appreciated.

Package        : squirrelmail
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0104 CAN-2005-0152
Debian Bug     : 292714

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squirrelmail, a
commonly used webmail system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-0104

    Upstream developers noticed that an unsanitised variable could
    lead to cross site scripting.

CAN-2005-0152

    Grant Hollingworth discovered that under certain circumstances URL
    manipulation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with
    the privileges of www-data.  This problem only exists in version
    1.2.6 of Squirrelmail.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) the problem that affects unstable
has been fixed in version 1.4.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages
