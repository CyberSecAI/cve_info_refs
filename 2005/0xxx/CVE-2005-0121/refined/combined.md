## Details

| Modified | 2005-01-19 |

Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities where detected. Both issues can
be used by local users to gain group games privileges on affected
systems.

The first overflow exists in the map name handling and can be
triggered when a very long name is given to the program during
command-line execution

The second overflow exists in the username processing while writing
the players score to disk. Excessivly long usernames, set via the USER
environment variable, are stored without any length checks in a memory
buffer.
