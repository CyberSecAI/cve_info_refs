- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the `golddig` program.
    - The first is in map name handling, triggered by an overly long name given as a command-line argument.
    - The second is in username processing, triggered by an overly long username set via the USER environment variable, which is written to disk without length checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflows due to lack of input sanitization and length checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local users can gain group games privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - First overflow: Supplying an overly long map name via command-line execution.
    - Second overflow: Setting an overly long username via the USER environment variable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user access is required.
