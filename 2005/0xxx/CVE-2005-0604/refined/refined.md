Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The GFI Languard Network Security Scanner (L.N.S.S) stores user credentials (usernames and passwords) in cleartext within the memory space of the `lnss.exe` process. This occurs when the "Alternative Credentials" option is used, as well as for MS-SQL server credentials used for saving scan reports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Credential Storage:** The primary weakness is storing sensitive credentials in cleartext within the application's memory.
- **Lack of Encryption:** The application fails to encrypt the stored passwords, making them easily accessible if the process's memory is dumped.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised Domain Credentials:** An attacker can gain access to domain administrator-level account credentials, which could lead to complete control over the domain.
- **Compromised MS-SQL Credentials:** An attacker can gain access to the MS-SQL server, potentially compromising data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (typically local admin) can dump the memory space of the `lnss.exe` process and extract the stored credentials.
- **Malicious Code:** This vulnerability could be exploited by malicious code running on the same system.
- **Remote Vulnerability:** This vulnerability could be leveraged after exploiting another remote vulnerability to gain local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where GFI L.N.S.S is running.
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs sufficient privileges (usually local admin) to access the memory space of the `lnss.exe` process.

The advisory highlights that while the attack vector is limited by the need for local, privileged access, the severity remains high because it can lead to domain-level compromise.
