Windows SMB Client Transaction Response Handling Vulnerability

Release Date:
February 8, 2005

Date Reported:
August 2, 2004

Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)

Vendor:
Microsoft

Systems Affected:
Windows 2000
Windows XP
Windows Server 2003

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a vulnerability in Windows SMB
client's handling of SMB responses. An attacker who can cause an
affected system to connect to the SMB service on a malicious host may
exploit this vulnerability in order to execute code on the victim's
machine.

Technical Details:
The driver MRXSMB.SYS is responsible for performing SMB client
operations and processing the responses returned by an SMB server
service. A number of important Windows File Sharing operations, and all
RPC-over-named-pipes, use the SMB commands Trans (25h) and Trans2 (32h).
A malicious SMB server can respond with specially crafted Transaction
response data that will cause an overflow wherever the data is handled,
either in MRXSMB.SYS or in client code to which it provides data. One
example would be if the file name and short file name length fields in a
Trans2 FIND_FIRST2 response packet can be supplied with inappropriately
large values in order to cause an excessive memcpy to occur when the
data is handled. In the case of these examples an attacker could
leverage file:// links, that when clicked by a remote user, would lead
to code execution.

Protection:
Retina - Network Security Scanner - has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.
Blink - End-Point Vulnerability Prevention - protects from this
vulnerability.

Vendor Status:
Microsoft has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available at:

Most viruses these days use spoofed email addresses. As such, using an Anti-Virus \
product which automatically notifies the perceived sender of a message it believes is \
infected may well cause more harm than good. Someone who did not actually send you a \
virus may receive the notification and scramble their support staff to find an \
infection which never existed in the first place. Suggest such notifications be \
disabled by whomever is responsible for your AV, or at least that the idea is \
                considered.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Server Message Block Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0045:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Server Message Block (SMB) that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerable to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Server Message Block Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0045:

* Network-based attacks using broadcast packets would typically be limited to the local subnet because most routers do not forward broadcast packets.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. By default, the Windows Firewall that is provided as part of Windows XP Service Pack 2 blocks the affected ports from responding to network based attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, Windows XP Service Pack 2 would still vulnerable to the Web-based attack scenarios.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it display a Web page with malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must click a link that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for Server Message Block Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0045:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Note** Other protocols such as IPX/SPX could be vulnerable to this issue. If those protocols are in use, it would be important to block the appropriate ports for those protocols as well. For more information about IPX/SPX, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/reskit/prch_cnn_goue.asp).

* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall:**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected protocol. Blocking them at the firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about the ports, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

#### FAQ for Server Message Block Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0045:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of the process that the affected operating systems use to validate certain incoming SMB packets.

**What is SMB?**

Server Message Block (SMB), and its follow-on, [Common Internet File System](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa302188.aspx) (CIFS), is the Internet Standard protocol that Windows uses to share files, printers, serial ports, and also to communicate between computers. To do this, SMB uses named pipes and mail slots. In a networked environment, servers make file systems and resources available to clients. Clients make SMB requests for resources. Servers make SMB responses. This is described as a client server, request-response protocol.

**Does this vulnerability also affect CIFS?**

Common Internet File System (CIFS) is an Internet Standard protocol. The vulnerability described here resides specifically in Microsoft's implementation of the protocol and not the protocol itself.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are several different ways that an attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability directly over a network by creating a series of specially crafted messages and sending them to an affected system. These messages could require an attacker to use broadcast packets. The messages could then cause the affected system to execute code. The network based attacks that require the use of broadcast packets would typically be limited to local subnets since routers do not typically forward broadcast packets.

Also, an attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability by persuading the user to view or to preview an e-mail message that contains a URL and then persuade the user to then click the URL.
An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could use another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component either locally or remotely.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk from this vulnerability. By default, the Windows Firewall that is provided as part of Windows XP Service Pack 2 blocks the affected ports from responding to network based attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, Windows XP Service Pack 2 would still vulnerable to the Web-based attack scenarios.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT professionals can visit the [Security Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the affected operating systems validate SMB network packets before it passes the data to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

Windows SMB Client Transaction Response Handling Vulnerability

Release Date:
February 8, 2005

Date Reported:
August 2, 2004

Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)

Vendor:
Microsoft

Systems Affected:
Windows 2000
Windows XP
Windows Server 2003

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a vulnerability in Windows SMB
client's handling of SMB responses. An attacker who can cause an
affected system to connect to the SMB service on a malicious host may
exploit this vulnerability in order to execute code on the victim's
machine.

Technical Details:
The driver MRXSMB.SYS is responsible for performing SMB client
operations and processing the responses returned by an SMB server
service. A number of important Windows File Sharing operations, and all
RPC-over-named-pipes, use the SMB commands Trans (25h) and Trans2 (32h).
A malicious SMB server can respond with specially crafted Transaction
response data that will cause an overflow wherever the data is handled,
either in MRXSMB.SYS or in client code to which it provides data. One
example would be if the file name and short file name length fields in a
Trans2 FIND_FIRST2 response packet can be supplied with inappropriately
large values in order to cause an excessive memcpy to occur when the
data is handled. In the case of these examples an attacker could
leverage file:// links, that when clicked by a remote user, would lead
to code execution.

Protection:
Retina - Network Security Scanner - has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.
Blink - End-Point Vulnerability Prevention - protects from this
vulnerability.

Vendor Status:
Microsoft has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is

## Microsoft Windows SMB packet validation vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#652537

Original Release Date: 2005-02-08 | Last Revised: 2005-05-11

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way that Microsoft Windows handles some SMB packets could allow remote attackers to execute code of their choosing on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB), and its follow-on, [Common Internet File System](http://www.microsoft.com/mind/1196/cifs.asp) (CIFS), are network protocols that Windows uses to share files, printers, serial ports, and communicate between computers. A vulnerability exists in the way that the affected operating systems validate certain incoming SMB packets. Additional details about the underlying cause of the vulnerability are not known.  An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by sending specially-crafted SMB packets to a vulnerable system. Microsoft reports that this vulnerability may also be exploited through a malicious web page. In this scenario, an attacker would need to trick or persuade a user into browsing the malicious web page or following a link to the malicious web page provided in an email message. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Microsoft has published [MS05-011](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-011.mspx) in response to this issue. Users are strongly encouraged to review this bulletin and apply the patches it refers to. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  **Filter network traffic**Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-011](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-011.mspx) also contains recommendations about packet filtering to mitigate this issue. Users, particularly those who are affected but unable to apply the patches, are encouraged to implement these workarounds. |

Windows NT 4.0 was found to be vulnerable to bugs resolved in the
MS05-011 patch. Microsoft will not be releasing a public Windows NT 4.0
patch due to the products end of life. Microsoft has however created a
private patch for customers whom have paid for extended Windows NT 4.0
support. For more information on extended Windows NT 4.0 support please
visit:
<http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2004/dec04/12-03NTSupport.as>
p

But enough of me being a spokesperson to Microsoft customers for
Microsoft... ;-)

If your organization is unlucky enough to still have Windows NT 4.0
systems (most due) and your not able to pay for extended support then
you do not have a whole lot of options. One way we found to mitigate
these attacks, at least some of them, is to enable SMB Signing. This
does not truly mitigate the attack but instead it creates change in the
SMB protocol that most attack tools I have seen do not support.
Therefore it breaks them from being able to successfully exploit remote
systems. In the end though an attacker can obviously add support for SMB
signing and your back to being vulnerable. It is however better than
nothing. For information on how to turn on SMB signing visit:
<http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;161372> Also you
should read and implement the NSA Windows NT 4.0 security guidelines as
they can in some cases provide more mitigation from attacks:
<http://www.nsa.gov/snac/downloads_winnt.cfm?MenuID=scg10.3.1.1> Obviously
any change at this level of the OS should be documented because there is
a good chance some legacy apps might break.

eEye customers with Blink (Host IPS) are protected from these attacks on
NT 4.0 systems regardless of patch level and without impact to
application functionality.

|
| Windows SMB Client Transaction Response Handling Vulnerability
|
| Release Date:
| February 8, 2005
|
| Date Reported:
| August 2, 2004
|
| Severity:
| High (Remote Code Execution)
|
| Vendor:
| Microsoft
|
| Systems Affected:
| Windows 2000
| Windows XP
| Windows Server 2003
|
| Overview:
| eEye Digital Security has discovered a vulnerability in
| Windows SMB client's handling of SMB responses. An attacker
| who can cause an affected system to connect to the SMB
| service on a malicious host may exploit this vulnerability in
| order to execute code on the victim's machine.
|
| Technical Details:
| The driver MRXSMB.SYS is responsible for performing SMB
| client operations and processing the responses returned by an
| SMB server service. A number of important Windows File
| Sharing operations, and all RPC-over-named-pipes, use the SMB
| commands Trans (25h) and Trans2 (32h). A malicious SMB server
| can respond with specially crafted Transaction response data
| that will cause an overflow wherever the data is handled,
| either in MRXSMB.SYS or in client code to which it provides
| data. One example would be if the file name and short file
| name length fields in a Trans2 FIND_FIRST2 response packet
| can be supplied with inappropriately large values in order to
| cause an excessive memcpy to occur when the data is handled.
| In the case of these examples an attacker could leverage
| file:// links, that when clicked by a remote user, would lead
| to code execution.
|
| Protection:
| Retina - Network Security Scanner - has been updated to
| identify this vulnerability.
| Blink - End-Point Vulnerability Prevention - protects from
| this vulnerability.
|
| Vendor Status:
| Microsoft has released a patch for this vulnerability. The
| patch is available at:
