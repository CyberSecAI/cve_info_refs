The provided content is related to CVE-2005-0429.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `forumdisplay.php` file of vBulletin versions 3.0 up to 3.0.4. It stems from the insecure use of `eval()` function in conjunction with user-controlled data. Specifically, the `$comma` variable, which can be manipulated through the query string due to the lack of sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Code injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary PHP code through the `$comma` variable because it's directly used inside an `eval()` function.
- **Unsanitized input:** The `$comma` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in the eval function.
- **Magic Quotes Bypass:** The exploit requires `magic_quotes_gpc` to be OFF, which is a common setting in PHP environment and allows direct injection of code without escaping.
- **Global variable overwrite:** The exploit also requires bypassing the `unset($GLOBALS["$_arrykey"])` by injecting a GLOBALS array `GLOBALS[]=1` that sets a global array, but doesn't unsets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **Full system compromise:** The attacker can gain full control of the web server by executing system-level commands.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is through crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the `forumdisplay.php` page, manipulating the `GLOBALS` array and `comma` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a GET request to the forum.
- The `showforumusers` option must be enabled in vBulletin.
- The attacker has to be a guest user (`$bbuserinfo['userid'] == 0`).
- There must be at least one user on the forum for `fetch_array($forumusers)` to return results.
- The server must have `magic_quotes_gpc` disabled.
- The attacker must bypass the unset($GLOBALS["$_arrykey"]) by injecting the GLOBALS array `GLOBALS[]=1`
