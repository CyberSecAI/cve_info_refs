Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities affecting Cyclades AlterPath Manager (APM) version 1.2.1:

**1. Information Disclosure (OSVDB-14073)**

*   **Root Cause:** The APM web interface discloses sensitive system information without requiring authentication.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gather information about the APM system, such as boot, kernel, config, OS, AP versions and hardware information, which could aid in further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Accessing the `/about.html` page on the web interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access to the APM web interface. No prior authentication is required.

**2. Arbitrary Console Connection (OSVDB-14075)**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient access controls in the `consoleConnect.jsp` page allow any user to connect to any console regardless of assigned restrictions.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Broken access control.
*   **Impact:** A user with limited console access can bypass restrictions and connect to any console by manipulating the `consolename` parameter in the URL.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Modifying the `consolename` parameter in the `consoleConnect.jsp` URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An authenticated APM user with any valid credentials.

**3. Privilege Escalation (OSVDB-14074)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `saveUser.do` functionality does not validate if a user has the permission to modify their privileges, allowing an attacker to change the `adminUser` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient access control and lack of proper permission checks.
*   **Impact:** Any authenticated user can grant themselves administrator privileges by modifying the `adminUser` parameter in the `saveUser.do` URL.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Modifying the `adminUser` parameter in the `saveUser.do` URL, along with other user details.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An authenticated APM user with any valid credentials.
