Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `configdir` parameter of the `awstats.pl` Perl CGI script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The `configdir` parameter is directly passed to the `open()` function in Perl without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by prefixing them with the `|` character within the `configdir` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server process (typically the `nobody` user).
- **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete server compromise, allowing the attacker to perform various malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing malicious input in the `configdir` parameter to the vulnerable `awstats.pl` script.
- **CGI Script:** The vulnerability is specific to the CGI version of AWStats.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable AWStats instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know the `configdir` parameter can be used to inject commands.
- **Ability to send HTTP request:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is being actively exploited according to public reports at the time of the advisory publication.
- The vulnerability affects AWStats versions 5.0 to 6.2 when used as a CGI script.
- AWStats version 6.3 addresses the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by iDEFENSE.
