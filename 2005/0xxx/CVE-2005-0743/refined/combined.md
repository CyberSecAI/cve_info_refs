## [Security](https://xoops.org/modules/news/index.php?storytopic=4 "Security"): Security Bulletin: TURN OFF CUSTOM AVATAR UPLOAD

***Posted by:** [Mithrandir](https://xoops.org/userinfo.php?uid=10820)On 2005/3/8 7:30:00*
**34860 reads**

A vulnerability has been reported in the XOOPS core that allows registered users to upload possibly malicious scripts to the webserver.

The vulnerability is in the upload of custom avatars and until we have complete overview of the consequences and correction of this exploit, we advise all XOOPS site administrators to TURN OFF CUSTOM AVATAR UPLOAD in System Admin -> Preferences -> User Info Settings -> "Allow Custom Avatar Upload"

ALSO, do NOT allow any non-trusted users to upload images through the image manager. i.e. in Administration Menu -> System Admin -> Images edit each and every category to NOT allow uploading by non-trusted usergroups.

We will keep you informed as soon as we have a fix for this exploit.

XOOPS Core Development Team

**UPDATE:**
A fix is available.
If no specific problem is encountered after deeper tests, it will be released tomorrow.

In the meantime, people you would like to try it and give us some feedback are welcome.
To install it, upload the two following files to your XOOPS /class/ folder:
[uploader.php](http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/%2Acheckout%2A/xoops/xoops2/class/uploader.php?rev=1.18) (check that you get the revision 1.18 or wait a little...)
[mimetypes.inc.php](http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/%2Acheckout%2A/xoops/xoops2/class/mimetypes.inc.php?rev=1.1)

The SF viewcvs updates are made regularly, but you may have to wait a few more minutes before the files become available. Alternatively, people with anonymous cvs access can get them from the XOOPS cvs repository right now.

Does anyone know if the WF-Downloads module is secure regarding this issue?

It has a file uploader and image uploader.

Thanks,

I'd also imagine you'll need to set the upload function in AMS and News 1.2 and higher to approvers only (granting approvers are trusted members only) or simply disable it altogether. Same goes for NewBB 2 I'd imagine.

We could not tell you as we do not have the full details regarding this. Not sure if this XOOPS uploader class issue or not, but we do use a modified version of this class.

I would suggest not allowing images uploads in WF-Downloads just now and we will let you know once we hear anything.

I am still researching, but I believe that News, AMS and WF-Downloads all check the extension to find the mimetype instead of relying on the browser to "figure it out" - if that is the case, it should be safe enough, but I'll have to make sure that this is the case.

The problem comes from uploading a file where you rely on the browser to set the mimetype without caring about the extension, thus allowing the user to upload an "image" e.g. with the extension .php4 that can subsequently be executed just by showing the "image"

Perhaps a 3-point-check would be good:

- mimetype OK?
- extension OK?
- reading a few lines from the file to ensure there is no malicious code inside

Just a suggestion...

I am deffo no expert in this area, but I believe that the way a browser determines the mimetype is by reading a few lines from the file - but that is done by the browser and not by the server and can be spoofed.

However, reading a few lines from the uploaded file will not ensure that there is no malicious code inside as it can contain perfectly alright image code until the end, where the malicious code is located.

Checking mimetype (whether forged or not) and extension (to only allow extensions the webserver will not parse as script files) seems to be the only reliable way we can do this - perhaps a 3rd step is needed, but I don't think reading a few lines from the uploaded file will make a difference.

Thanks for the suggestion, though.

I have uploaded a modified class to the [bug tracker item](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1153206&group_id=41586&atid=430840) - could someone check if it is possible to upload an image, where the extension has been changed to e.g. php3 through that?

Security-wise, checking the extension is probably adequate.

The file name should also be sanitized so that it doesn't contain any unsafe characters. I think the avatars are assigned new names anyway, so that wouldn't be an issue.

In the case of image files, the PHP function [getimagesize](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.getimagesize.php) is useful, since it reads at least part of the file to get the image type and dimensions.

I have to agree with dave\_l, you can gain a lot of information from this usefull function and should help here determine a 'real' image file from a 'fake one' or if the server supports it, try putting the file through a GD lib function ; )=.

I'm not sure what the problem is..

I thought you said it figured out the mime type from the first few lines of the file, i tried adding code to an image file and changing an extension but the upload code didn't like the extension so it is apparently checking. (this is a few month old XOOPS build)

Am I missing something?

ps: In the mean time however I have disallowed avatar upload on my live site.

A patch will be available in a few minutes.

Considering I got back home in the middle of the night and didn't test it extensively (it 4AM here), I'll first edit the news so you can download it directly from the sourceforge viewcvs interface (only one file to update and another one to add, both in /class/).
Please feel free to test it and report us any problem, so we can release a real update tomorrow.

I appreciate the communication on this issue, well done! I also have a question concerning the new files (rev 1.18). After I uploaded these new files in my /class/ directory I get an error "Errors Returned While Uploading; Error loading mimetypes definition" when members want to upload an avatar. Any solution? Thanks!

We will do our best to get a security update out within the week so you can once again turn on the custom avatars and image manager.

Are you asking if we can confirm it is your understanding? ![](https://xoops.org/uploads/smil42e7a65fee35d.gif) <http://www.peak.ne.jp/xoops/> sees to say that this is not the case, but that they have implemented a fixed version for the my-album\_p module. (Or I have read it wrong, that's also possible)

Yantje, your error occurs when the mimetypes.inc.php could not be included properly.

Could you double-check that:
1. The mimetypes.inc.php is present in your class/ folder
2. You do not get a parse error, if you access it directly? (<http://www.example.com/class/mimetypes.inc.php> - it should show a blank screen as there is no output in the class, but if it is corrupted, it may throw a parse error)

Is this "fix" incorporated into 2.0.16? My avatar upload will not work, nor will image manager. Should I install this fix which is quite old in 2.0.16? This is all very confusing.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
