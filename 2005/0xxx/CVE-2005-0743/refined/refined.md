  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-0743",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is in the upload of custom avatars. The system relies on the browser to set the MIME type without proper validation of the file extension, allowing a user to upload a file with a malicious extension like .php4, while tricking the system into thinking it's an image. This could allow for arbitrary code execution on the server.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate validation of uploaded file types.",
        "Reliance on browser-provided MIME types.",
        "Insufficient file extension checks.",
         "Lack of proper sanitization of uploaded files."
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious user could upload and execute arbitrary code on the web server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server and the XOOPS site.",
      "attack_vectors": "Uploading a file through the custom avatar upload feature or through the image manager with a manipulated file extension.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "A registered user on the XOOPS site."
