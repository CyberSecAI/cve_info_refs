## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Does this update contain any other changes to functionality?**

Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin, this update includes the following change in functionality: The SharePoint Team Services security update contains a non-security change that affects both SharePoint Team Services and FrontPage 2002. Customers using FrontPage 2002 are not required to install the available SharePoint Team Services security update. However, because of the non-security change, the SharePoint Team Services security update will be recommended through Office Update and through MBSA to customers that have installed FrontPage 2002. This non-security change resolves an issue that occurs in SharePoint Team Services and in FrontPage 2002 where the value of the Turkish Lira is displayed only in TL format. For more information about this non-security change, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 890829](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/890829).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine whether this update is required, but only for programs that MBSA supports. For example, MBSA does support SharePoint Team Services, and will detect whether the update is required for that program. MBSA supports the SharePoint Team Services from Microsoft update by using the Office Detection Tool and is therefore limited to local scans.
MBSA does not support Windows SharePoint Services, and will not detect whether the update is required for that program. However, Microsoft has developed a version of the [Enterprise Update Scanning Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) (EST) that will help customers determine if the Windows SharePoint Services security update is required.
For detailed information about the programs that MBSA currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date by using MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2.1 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 1.2.1 Q&A; Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33332).

**What is the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, [detailed documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you need to apply this update. For more information about the version of the EST being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). For more detailed deployment information about the version of the EST being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894192). There is also a version of this tool that SMS customers can obtain from the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154). This tool may also be available for SMS customers from the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect. However, there is a version of the EST that SMS customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators from the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894194).
For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158). The Security Update Inventory Tool is required for detecting Microsoft Windows and other affected Microsoft products. For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). SMS can also use the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect for required updates for Microsoft Office applications such as SharePoint Team Services.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0049:

This is a cross-site scripting and spoofing vulnerability. The cross-site scripting vulnerability could allow an attacker to convince a user to run a malicious script. If this malicious script is run, it would execute in the security context of the user. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction. This vulnerability could allow an attacker access to any data on the affected systems that was accessible to the individual user.

It may also be possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability to modify Web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches, and put spoofed content in those caches.

#### Mitigating Factors for Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0049:

**Mitigating factors for cross-site scripting attacks:**

* An attacker who successfully exploited the cross-site scripting aspect of this vulnerability would gain only the same permissions as the user.

**Mitigating factors for putting spoofed content in a userâs Web browser cache:**

* Clients who have turned on the **Do not save encrypted pages to disk** advanced Internet option in Internet Explorer would not be at risk from any attempts to put spoofed content into the client cache if they accessed their Web site through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

**Mitigating factors for putting spoofed content in an intermediate proxy server cacheâ**

* Clients who use SSL-protected connections to access the affected Web sites would not be vulnerable to attempts to put spoofed content on intermediate proxy server caches. This is because SSL session data is encrypted and is not cached on intermediate proxy servers.
* If spoofed content is successfully put in an intermediate proxy serverâs cache, it could be difficult for an attacker to predict which users would be served the spoofed cached content.
* An attacker must be able to log on the affected Web site to try to exploit this vulnerability. If you do not allow anonymous access to your Web site, only authenticated users could try to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0049:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Cross-site Scripting and Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0049:

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyze, Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
