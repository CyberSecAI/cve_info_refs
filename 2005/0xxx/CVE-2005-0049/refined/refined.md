Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in how Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services and SharePoint Team Services handle HTML redirection queries. Specifically, the affected software does not properly sanitize input provided to a HTML redirection query before sending it to the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a cross-site scripting flaw. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the HTML redirection queries. If a user interacts with a crafted URL, the malicious script would execute within the user's security context.
*   **Spoofing:** The vulnerability could be leveraged to modify web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches. This allows attackers to inject spoofed content into those caches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the cross-site scripting vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the security context of the affected user. This grants the attacker the same privileges as the user.
*   **Data Access:**  An attacker could access any data on the affected system accessible to the user who executes the malicious script.
*   **Cache Poisoning:** By modifying Web browser and intermediate proxy server caches, attackers can display spoofed content to users.
*   **Redirection:** Attackers could redirect server responses to another user or a different location.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** Attackers can send specially crafted emails with malicious links that exploit the vulnerability. They then must convince the user to click on the link.
*   **Web:** The vulnerability can be triggered via manipulated URLs.
*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as clicking a malicious link.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the crafted requests or emails.
*   **Authentication:** For the spoofing attacks, the attacker needs to be authenticated to the affected website.
*   **Knowledge of Affected Software:** The attacker must know the target is using the vulnerable software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Windows SharePoint Services for Windows Server 2003 and SharePoint Team Services from Microsoft.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
*   Microsoft released security updates (KB887981 and KB890829) to address this issue.
*   Mitigations include using SSL for connections (to prevent spoofing in proxy caches) and enabling the "Do not save encrypted pages to disk" setting in Internet Explorer (to prevent spoofing in client cache).
