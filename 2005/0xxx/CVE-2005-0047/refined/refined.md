Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how affected operating systems and programs handle memory access when processing COM structured storage files or objects. Specifically, there is an error in the way memory is accessed during the handling of these files.
*   The core issue is an unchecked buffer in the process that OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) uses to validate data, leading to an input validation vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Access Error:** The system incorrectly accesses memory while processing COM structured storage files.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability enables a local attacker to elevate their privileges.
*   **Input Validation Vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer within OLE's data validation process allows for potential remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could gain complete control over the system by executing arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This can lead to the installation of programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and the creation of new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker, particularly in the context of Exchange servers, could achieve complete control of a system.
*   The attacker's code would run with the same privileges as the component that exposes the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker with valid logon credentials must be able to log on locally to the vulnerable system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Specially Crafted Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted COM structured storage files or OLE objects. This could be achieved by running a malicious application or opening a malicious document.
*   **Network:** For Exchange servers, the vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted messages to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials to log on to the target system.
*   **Ability to Run Applications:** The attacker needs to be able to run a program on the target system.
*   **Network (for Exchange):** The attacker must be able to deliver a crafted message to the Exchange server for remote code execution.
*   **User interaction (for non-exchange servers)**: For non-exchange servers, the user must open a malicious file, such as an email attachment or webpage, for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects various Microsoft products, including Windows (2000, XP, Server 2003), Exchange Server, and Office.
*   The provided exploit POC targets the Structured Storage vulnerability, as demonstrated in several security conferences.
*   Microsoft's bulletin MS05-012 addresses this vulnerability along with another input validation vulnerability (CAN-2005-0044), and it strongly recommends users apply the provided updates.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely on Windows workstations or terminal servers. However, Exchange Servers are more at risk, particularly those that accept anonymous connections.
