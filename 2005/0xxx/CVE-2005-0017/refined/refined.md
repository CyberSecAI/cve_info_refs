      "source": "www.gentoo.org_2f9308d0_20250125_080608.html",
      "root_cause": "Insecure temporary file creation in world-writeable directories with predictable names.",

        "Symlink attack vulnerability.",
        "Predictable temporary file names."
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker can create symbolic links in the temporary files directory, pointing to a valid file. When f2c is executed, the pointed-to file is overwritten with the rights of the user running f2c, which could be the root user. This allows overwriting of arbitrary files on the system.",

        "Local access."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local attacker with the ability to create symlinks in the world-writeable temporary directory used by f2c."
