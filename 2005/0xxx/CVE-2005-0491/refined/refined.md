  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the processing of a type 77 request within the Arkeia server software.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack overflow",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution with root or SYSTEM privileges on the target system.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote network attack",
        "Sending a specially crafted network packet (type 77 request) to the vulnerable server"
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Arkeia server."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The exploit code targets both Linux and Windows systems, and it has been tested against Redhat 7.2/8.0, Win2k SP2/SP3/SP4, WinXP SP1, and Win 2003 EE. The overflow happens at different offsets depending on the target OS. The Linux exploit exports an xterm, while the Windows one spawns a shell on port 80. It is also mentioned that the heap method for Linux targets avoids non-exec stack protection. The Windows exploit takes advantage of the little-endian architecture and the heap memory mapping."
