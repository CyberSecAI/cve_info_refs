# gFTP: Directory traversal vulnerability — GLSA **200502-27**

gFTP is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks, possibly leading to the
creation or overwriting of arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/gftp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.18-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.18-r1** |

### Background

gFTP is a GNOME based, multi-threaded file transfer client.

### Description

gFTP lacks input validation of filenames received by remote
servers.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious FTP
server and conduct a directory traversal attack by making use of
specially crafted filenames. This could lead to arbitrary files being
created or overwritten.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All gFTP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/gftp-2.0.18-r1"
```

Debian Security Advisory DSA 686-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
February 17th, 2005                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : gftp
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0372

Albert Puigsech Galicia discovered a directory traversal vulnerability
in a proprietary FTP client (CAN-2004-1376) which is also present in
gftp, a GTK+ FTP client.  A malicious server could provide a specially
crafted filename that could cause arbitrary files to be overwritten or
created by the client.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1woody1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.18-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gftp package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
