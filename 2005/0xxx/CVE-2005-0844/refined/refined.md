- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Nortel VPN client stores the user and group passwords in plaintext within the process memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Clear-text password storage in memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the client system or its memory dump can obtain the user and group passwords.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Dumping the process memory (Extranet.exe) to a file using tools like PMDump.
    - Crashing the system and obtaining a physical memory dump.
    - Potentially, gaining access to the obfuscated password in the registry, then using the VPN client to expose the plain-text version.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Access to the client system.
    - Ability to dump process memory or system memory.
    - Potentially, access to the client registry settings.
