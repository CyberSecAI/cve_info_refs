| [Description](#c0)  Andreas Korthaus    2005-03-24 01:42:55 UTC  ``` Smarty 2.6.8 Released  [21-March-2005] For those using template security: A vulnerability in the regex_replace modifier has been fixed that allowed PHP code to be executed from a template, even with template security enabled. If you are using template security features, it is highly recommended to upgrade, or at least replace the modifier plugin. A problem with the {strip}{/strip} tags (that was introduced in 2.6.7) has been fixed. Casting objects to arrays in the {foreach} "item" attribute has been addressed.  ChangeLog: <http://smarty.php.net/misc/NEWS> download: <http://smarty.php.net/download.php>  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-24 02:16:28 UTC  ``` PHP team, please bump ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sebastian Bergmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-24 08:32:23 UTC  ``` dev-php/smarty-2.6.8 is in portage now. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-24 09:18:03 UTC  ``` Arches: please test and mark stable ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-24 19:46:47 UTC  ``` Stable on SPARC. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sebastian Bergmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-24 21:17:45 UTC  ``` Stable on x86 and amd64. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Michael Hanselmann (hansmi) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-25 01:36:08 UTC  ``` Stable on ppc. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Michael Hanselmann (hansmi) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-25 13:07:22 UTC  ``` Stable on hppa, thanks to KillerFox for testing. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-26 10:19:52 UTC  ``` Stable on alpha. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-30 06:53:36 UTC  ``` GLSA 200503-35 ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Tom Knight (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-08 06:48:51 UTC  ``` Smarty 2.6.9 has been released with some more security fixes, I'll add the ebuild soon. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-08 06:53:49 UTC  ``` will be released as an update to GLSA 200503-35 ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Tom Knight (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-08 08:07:00 UTC  ``` smarty{,-docs}-2.6.9 in cvs, stable on x86 and amd64.

It would be good for someone to change that wording, thanks. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-06 10:55:49 UTC  ``` tomk/php-bugs/auditors please advise wether this is remotely exploitable. ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Tom Knight (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-06 11:20:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=86488#c19)) > tomk/php-bugs/auditors please advise wether this is remotely exploitable. >   According to the first entry in: <http://smarty.php.net/index_archive.php> it's not remotely exploitable. You need local access to the smarty template files to be able bypass certain checks when template security is enabled. That being said, when such a template has been created by a local user then the vulnerable code would be run when accessed remotely via the webserver. I'm unsure as to the criteria used to determine whether that is defined as being locally or remotely exploitable. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-07 13:40:17 UTC  ``` I defined it as remotely exploitable because smarty's "template security" feature is typically used to allow untrusted users to plug their own template in a PHP application (for example, a bulletin board that allows users to customize templates). The hole is that the "template security" feature can be bypassed to allow to execute arbitrary code while theorically this should not be possible for those users. In which case the hole is remote, because the attacker doesn't need to be a local user.  I agree it's a little misleading to use the term "Remote attacker" everywhere, since the attack can only be remote if the application allows users to upload their own templates...  ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-10 15:28:47 UTC  ``` > I defined it as remotely exploitable because smarty's "template security" > feature is typically used to allow untrusted users to plug their own template > in a PHP application (for example, a bulletin board that allows users to > customize templates).  yes, but generally, such PHP interfaces are reserved with an authentication device (at least, i hope so). Consequently, the potential attackers are not totally "unknown". This is remote but reserved for known members of a group.  Well i think this doens't worth any update and we could close it. ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-22 06:53:35 UTC  ``` I think we can close this bug now, please REOPEN if anyone disagrees. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Smarty: Template vulnerability — GLSA **200503-35**

Smarty's "Template security" feature can be bypassed, potentially allowing
a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-php/smarty** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6.9** |

### Background

Smarty is a template engine for PHP. The "template security" feature of
Smarty is designed to help reduce the risk of a system compromise when
you have untrusted parties editing templates.

### Description

A vulnerability has been discovered within the regex\_replace modifier
of the Smarty templates when allowing access to untrusted users.
Furthermore, it was possible to call functions from {if} statements and
{math} functions.

### Impact

These issues may allow a remote attacker to bypass the "template
security" feature of Smarty, and execute arbitrary PHP code.

### Workaround

Do not grant template access to untrusted users.

### Resolution

All Smarty users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/smarty-2.6.9"
```

> This release addresses a hole that was discovered in Smarty's
> regex_replace modifier that permitted PHP code to be executed even when
> security was enabled. An issue with {strip}{/strip} has been fixed and
> notably, {foreach} no longer casts objects to arrays which had
> prevented PHP5 object iterators from being used.
