Debian Security Advisory DSA 717-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
April 27th, 2005                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : lsh-utils
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow, typo
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2003-0826 CAN-2005-0814
Debian Bug     : 211662

Several security relevant problems have been discovered in lsh, the
alternative secure shell v2 (SSH2) protocol server.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CAN-2003-0826

    Bennett Todd discovered a heap buffer overflow in lshd which could
    lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CAN-2005-0814

    Niels MÃ¶ller discovered a denial of service condition in lshd.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.5-2woody3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.1-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your lsh-server package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
