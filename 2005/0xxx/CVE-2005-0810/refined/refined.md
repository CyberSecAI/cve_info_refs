- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability present in multiple scripts of the NotifyLink application.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthenticated remote attackers can view the entire contents of the NotifyLink database, which may contain email message text, encryption keys, and various authentication credentials.
    - Unauthenticated remote attackers can add new client users with specific usernames and passwords.
