## NotifyLink contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#264097

Original Release Date: 2005-03-17 | Last Revised: 2005-04-20

---

### Overview

There are multiple vulnerabilities in NotifyLink that allow unauthenticated remote users to view or modify the contents of the NotifyLink SQL database. Possible modifications include the addition of unauthorized user and administrator accounts.

### Description

| Notify Technology [NotifyLink Enterprise Server](http://notifylink.notify.net/) allows users to synchronize e-mail between a PDA and a mail server. The application consists of a PDA-specific client and the NotifyLink server, which acts as a proxy between the client and the mail server(s) the user wants to check. For each e-mail account to be monitored, the user provides mail server credentials that are stored on the NotifyLink server and used to periodically check for mail. When new mail arrives, the NotifyLink server stores a reference to the message ID. Depending on the configuration, the message is either sent to the device via SMS ("Push" mode), or the device periodically checks a link on the NotifyLink web server to retrieve the message ("Poll" mode). The product supports multiple PDA platforms and multiple e-mail servers, including IMAP, POP, Microsoft Exchange, and Novell GroupWise.  The NotifyLink server stores client configuration and message data in a Microsoft SQL database that is accessible using an ASP web application. The database engine is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks that allow an attacker to make unauthorized queries against the SQL database. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would append the desired SQL query to one of several URLs generated by the ASP code. After processing the expected arguments, the ASP script will pass the injected SQL queries to the database engine for evaluation. This vulnerability affects multiple scripts within the NotifyLink application and can be used to accomplish a variety of tasks, including:- Unauthenticated remote attackers can view the entire contents of the NotifyLink database- Unauthenticated remote attackers can add a new client user with a specific username and password- Unauthenticated remote attackers can erase the password of an existing client user- Authenticated client users can add administrative accounts with a specific username and password |
