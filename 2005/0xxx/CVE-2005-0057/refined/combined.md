## Microsoft Hyperlink Object Library buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#820427

Original Release Date: 2005-02-08 | Last Revised: 2005-02-08

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow exists in the Microsoft Windows system library used when handling [hyperlinks](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/misc/hlink/overview/overview.asp#What_Is_a_Hyperlink_). All currently supported versions of Microsoft Windows are affected.

### Description

| An unchecked buffer in the Microsoft Object Library is vulnerable to attack when malformed hyperlinks are handled. Such handling occurs most often when a user clicks on a hyperlink in a browser or in HTML-rendered email.  The Object Library is a dynamic [application interface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/misc/hlink/overview/overview.asp) library used by Windows programs to manage [hyperlink objects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/misc/hlink/overview/overview.asp#What_Is_a_Hyperlink_). Hyperlink objects are any COM objects (including ActiveX) that implement the [IHlink](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/misc/hlink/reference/ifaces/ihlink/ihlink.asp) interface. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could execute arbitrary code of their choosing on the system running the vulnerable version of Windows. Upon successful exploitation, the malicious code would be executed with the privileges of the user being attacked. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**Microsoft has published Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-015](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-015.mspx) in response to this issue. Users are encouraged to review this bulletin and apply the patches it refers to. |
| --- |

| WorkaroundsAs noted in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-015](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-015.mspx):**Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**Note that an email-borne attack vector requires a click event on a hyperlink to occur. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Hyperlink Object Library Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0057:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Hyperlink Object Library. This problem exists because of an unchecked buffer while handling hyperlinks. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious hyperlink which could potentially lead to remote code execution if a user clicks a malicious link within a Web site or e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Hyperlink Object Library Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0057:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it display a Web page with malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to click on the malicious link. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click on a link within an e-mail message.
* Customers running Microsoft ISA 2004 as their web proxy are at less risk from this vulnerability, as ISA 2004 rejects the URL in question when handling proxy client requests if any âRequest URLâ based HTTP Filter Signature definition exists. For information on HTTP Filtering in ISA 2004, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/isa/2004/plan/httpfiltering.mspx).

#### Workarounds for Hyperlink Object Library Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0057:

Microsoft has tested the following workaround. While this workaround will not correct the underlying vulnerability, it will help block known attack vectors.

* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for Hyperlink Object Library Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0057:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the Hyperlink Object Library.

**What is the Hyperlink Object Library?**

The Hyperlink Object Library is a collection of application programming interfaces. These interfaces which provide functionality to software developers for handling hyperlinks. For more information about hyperlinks, see the [product documentation](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa740928.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted link . After which, the attacker would need to entice the user into clicking the malicious link within a Web site or e-mail message.
An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could log on to the system interactively or by using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Hyperlink Object Library validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
