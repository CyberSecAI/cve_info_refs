Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2005-0057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unchecked buffer within the Microsoft Hyperlink Object Library. This library is responsible for handling hyperlinks in Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper bounds checking when handling hyperlinks. This allows for writing beyond the allocated memory space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.
- **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, enabling actions such as installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full privileges. The malicious code executes with the privileges of the user being attacked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Hyperlinks:** The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious hyperlinks.
  - **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious web pages or compromise legitimate websites to display these malicious links.
  - **Email Attacks:** Attackers can send emails with malicious links, which when clicked, exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious hyperlink that triggers the buffer overflow.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to click on the malicious hyperlink (either on a webpage or within an email).
- The attacker doesn't need direct access to the system; the attack is performed remotely via the hyperlink.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects all currently supported versions of Microsoft Windows at the time of disclosure, including Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, and Server 2003.
- User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability (clicking on a malicious link).
- Users with administrative rights are at greater risk because the attacker gains the same rights as the user.
- Microsoft released security bulletin MS05-015 to address this vulnerability.
- As a workaround, users were advised to read emails in plain text format to mitigate the risk from HTML emails.
- The vulnerability was privately reported, and there were no known reports of it being exploited at the time of the bulletin release.
