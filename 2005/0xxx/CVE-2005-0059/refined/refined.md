- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer in the Message Queuing component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Message Queuing component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can achieve remote code execution, gaining complete control of an affected system. This can lead to the attacker being able to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a specially crafted message to an affected system. This crafted message can be delivered over the network using RPC ports.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted message to a system with Message Queuing installed. The attacker can be remote, potentially over the internet using RPC, although MSMQ HTTP delivery is not vulnerable to this specific vulnerability.
