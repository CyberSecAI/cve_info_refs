## Vulnerability Details

#### Message Queuing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0059:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Message Queuing that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Message Queuing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0059:

* By default, the Message Queuing component is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually install the Message Queuing component are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
* Message Queuing installations that expose only MSMQ HTTP Message Delivery to the Internet are not vulnerable.
* For customers that require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for Message Queuing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0059:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **UDP ports 135, 137, 138, 445, 1801, and 3527, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, 593, 1801, 2101, 2103, 2105, and 2107**
  + **All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024**
  + **Any other specifically configured RPC port**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with RPC. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports that RPC uses, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **Remove Message Queuing if you do not need it.**

  If you no longer need Message Queuing, remove it. To do this, follow these steps. These steps apply only to Windows XP Service Pack 1. For Windows 2000, follow the procedure that is included in the product documentation.

  **Note** Special permissions may be required to remove Message Queuing. For more information, see the following [Message Queuing documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/advanced/help/default.asp?url=/windows2000/en/advanced/help/sag_msmqnode_install.htm).

  1. Click, **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click, **Add or Remove Programs**.
  3. In the default Category View, click **Add or Remove Programs**.
  4. Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
  5. On the Windows Components Wizard page, under **Components**, click to clear the **Message Queuing** check box to remove Message Queuing, and then click **Next**.
  6. Complete the Windows Components Wizard by following the instructions on the screen.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Many organizations require Message Queuing to perform important functions. Administrators should not remove Message Queuing unless they fully understand the effect that doing this will have on their environment. For more information about Message Queuing, see the [Message Queuing product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/technologies/communications/msmq/default.asp).

#### FAQ for Message Queuing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0059:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the Message Queuing component.

**What is Message Queuing?**

Microsoft Message Queuing technology enables applications that are running at different times to communicate across heterogeneous networks and across systems that may be temporarily offline. Applications send messages to queues and read messages from queues. Message Queuing provides guaranteed message delivery, efficient routing, security, and priority-based messaging. It can be used to implement solutions for both asynchronous and synchronous messaging scenarios. For more information about Message Queuing, see the [Message Queuing product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/technologies/communications/msmq/default.asp).

**What Microsoft applications use Message Queuing?**

Message Queuing must be installed before you can install BizTalk Server 2000 or BizTalk Server 2002. Message Queuing is an optional component that can be used by BizTalk Server 2004. Other Microsoft applications and third-party applications may also use Message Queuing.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to execute code.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All systems that have Message Queuing installed are at risk from this vulnerability. By default, the Message Queuing component is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually install the Message Queuing component are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet by using RPC ports. Most Message Queuing deployments that are available through the Internet use the MSMQ HTTP Message Delivery component which is not vulnerable to this issue. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet that use RPC.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB892944\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 892944 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyze, Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
