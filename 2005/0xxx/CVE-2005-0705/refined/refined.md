Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0705:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the GPRS-LLC dissector in Ethereal. Specifically, the application could crash when the "ignore cipher bit" option is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Crash vulnerability due to an issue with the GPRS-LLC dissector when a specific option is enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could cause Ethereal to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is triggered by network traffic containing malformed or specific GPRS-LLC data when the vulnerable option is enabled.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic that Ethereal will analyze.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of Ethereal with the specific "ignore cipher bit" option enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content from gentoo.org provides more detail than a standard CVE description, including:
    - The specific dissector involved (GPRS-LLC).
    - The configuration required to trigger it ("ignore cipher bit" enabled).
    - The vulnerability is a crash, rather than arbitrary code execution like other listed vulnerabilities.
    - The advisory also contains upgrade instructions.
