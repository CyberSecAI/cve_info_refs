```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the vote_save_results.php script of Hola CMS. The script attempts to check if a submitted 'vote_filename' variable contains "holaDB/votes" at the beginning using strpos(). However, the check can be bypassed by using directory traversal sequences like "../" in the 'vote_filename' variable.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  -  Directory Traversal: The application allows an attacker to traverse the directory structure using "../" sequences in the 'vote_filename' parameter.
  -  Insecure File Handling: The application uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to overwrite arbitrary files on the server.
  -  Insufficient Input Validation: The check implemented to avoid the vulnerability is inadequate and does not prevent directory traversal attacks.

- Impact of exploitation:
  -  Arbitrary File Overwrite: An attacker can overwrite any file on the server that the web server user has write access to, including critical files such as the admin login authentication file (multiuser.php).
  -  Privilege Escalation: By overwriting the authentication file, an attacker can gain access to administrative functions, potentially leading to full control over the website.

- Attack vectors:
  -  HTTP POST Request: An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the vote processing script (vote.php) with a manipulated "vote_filename" variable.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  -  Network Access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Hola CMS instance.
  -  Knowledge of vulnerable parameters: The attacker must be aware of the `vote_filename` parameter in the vote processing script.
