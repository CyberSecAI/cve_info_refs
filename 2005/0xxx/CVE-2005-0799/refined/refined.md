Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how MySQL Server for Windows handles requests containing reserved MS-DOS device names (AUX, CON, COM1, LPT1, and PRN) when used as database names in a `USE` statement. Specifically, using "LPT1" or "PRN" as a database name will cause the server to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation or handling of reserved MS-DOS device names within the MySQL server's database switching logic.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a standard SQL statement (`USE`) when a specific, reserved name is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to crash the MySQL service, causing a denial of service. This would make the database unavailable for all users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An authenticated user must be able to connect to the MySQL server over the network.
- **SQL Injection (indirect):** While not traditional SQL injection, the attacker leverages a specific SQL statement (`USE database_name`) with a specially crafted `database_name` to cause the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials for a MySQL user account.
- **Privileges:** The attacker must have at least one of the following global privileges (on `*.*`):
    - `REFERENCES`
    - `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES`
    - `GRANT OPTION`
    - `CREATE`
    - `SELECT`

**Technical Details:**
- The crash occurs specifically when the attacker executes `USE LPT1;` or `USE PRN;` SQL commands. Other reserved names (NUL, CON, COM1, AUX) do not cause a crash, but rather may incorrectly report a database change.
- The provided call stack shows the crash originates within the `_my_vsnprintf()` function, and further points to the `net_printf()` function which are related to string formatting and output during the processing of the `USE` command.

**Versions Affected:**
- MySQL versions 4.1.x, 4.0.x and 5.0.x are affected.
- Specifically mentioned versions are 4.1.9, and the bug was fixed in 4.1.13 and 5.0.8.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was patched by sanitizing database names or properly handling reserved device names and was released in versions 4.1.13 and 5.0.8.
