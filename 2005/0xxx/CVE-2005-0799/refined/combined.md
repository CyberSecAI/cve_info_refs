Description:
Package: MySQL Database Server for Windows
Version(s): 4.1.9 (Maybe also prior versions are vulnerable)
Vulnerability Type: Denial of Service

Vulnerability Description:
================

A vulnerability exist in the way application handle requests
containing reserved MS-DOS devices name (AUX,CON,COM1,LPT1 and PRN).
This flaw allows an authenticaded user with at least one of those
privileges on *.*:

- REFERENCES
- CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES
- GRANT OPTION
- CREATE
- SELECT

to cause the service to fail.

How to repeat:
1- Create an user account:

(connected as 'root')

use mysql;
INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password) VALUES('%','customer',PASSWORD('customer'));

2- Grant to him one or more privileges reported above:

(connected as 'root')

GRANT CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON *.* TO 'customer'@'%';
flush privileges;

3- Connect to server using new account and 'use' the database 'LPT1':

(connected as 'customer')
use LPT1;
```

Thank you for the bug report. I will back with the call stack from
latest BK source.

I noticed that the crash happens on release servers i.e.: mysqld-nt.exe
and the debug server or return an error as database unknown or the
client hangs. Below the call stack of release server 4.1.11;

>	mysqld-nt.exe!_my_vsnprintf()  + 0x130	C
 	mysqld-nt.exe!net_printf()  + 0x92	C++

 	mysqld-nt.exe!dispatch_command()  + 0xfb	C++
 	mysqld-nt.exe!do_command()  + 0xa7	C++
 	mysqld-nt.exe!_handle_one_connection()  + 0x1ed	C++

```

```
My own testing shows USE LPT1; and USE PRN; to be the only server
crashers. NUL, CON, COM1, and AUX do not crash the server, but actually
report the database successfully changed.

Noted in 4.1.13, 5.0.7 changelogs.
```

Carsten Segieth
```
The problem still exists using the "official" 5.0.7-beta binaries (reproducible on different WinXP Home machines).
With 'bk changes' in a 5.0 tree the fixes can be seen (prior the clone for the 5.0.7 build was made), but in the ChangeLog shipped with the 5.0.7-beta package no reference to the fix could be found.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
