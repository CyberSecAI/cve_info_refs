Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in the Netgear FVS318 router:

**Vulnerability 1: URL Filter Bypass via HEX Encoding**

*   **Root Cause:** The router's URL filter does not properly handle HEX encoded characters.
*   **Weakness:** Inadequate input validation/sanitization in the URL filtering mechanism. The filter searches for literal strings, and doesn't decode hex encoded strings before checking against the blocked list.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can bypass the router's URL filter by encoding characters in blocked URL phrases, allowing access to restricted resources.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user on the network attempts to access a blocked URL but encodes part of it to avoid filter detection.
*   **Required Capabilities:** User must be able to send network requests. No admin privileges are required.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Content Filter/Log Viewer**

*   **Root Cause:** The security log displays logged URL attempts without proper sanitization of user-controlled data, specifically when logging blocked URL phrases.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding/sanitization in the security log viewer, allows for execution of arbitrary javascript.
*   **Impact:** When an administrator views the security log, JavaScript injected within a blocked URL phrase is executed in the administrator's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities within the administrator's browsing session.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user injects malicious JavaScript into a URL, which is then blocked and logged. When the admin views the log, the script is executed.
*  **Required Capabilities:** User must be able to send network requests. No admin privileges are required.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

The Netgear FVS318 router has two vulnerabilities: a URL filter bypassable through HEX encoding and a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the content filter/log viewer. These vulnerabilities allow users on the network to circumvent content restrictions and potentially compromise the router's management interface.
