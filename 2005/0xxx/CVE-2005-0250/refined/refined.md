- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `auditselect` command in IBM AIX contains a format string vulnerability due to the use of formatted output routines like `printf()` without proper sanitization of user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Format string vulnerability in the `auditselect` command. The command does not adequately filter or restrict input containing format string specifiers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with membership in the audit group can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by passing a specially crafted parameter to the `auditselect` command. This parameter will be passed to a formatted output routine, which due to a lack of sanitization will allow for the format string vulnerability to be triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local user with membership in the audit group.
