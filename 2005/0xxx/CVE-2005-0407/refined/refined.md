```
Advisory: Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability in Openconf Conference Management Software
```

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input filtering in the Openconf Conference Management Software. Specifically, user-provided input, such as the title of a submitted paper, is not sanitized before being displayed to other users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to session hijacking/takeover of users with higher privileges, such as conference administrators. This could allow an attacker to arbitrarily influence conference settings, submitted papers, or other aspects of the conference management system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through an anonymous user submitting a paper containing malicious script code in the title field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability without authentication. They need only to be able to submit a paper to the conference system.
