{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes a file using a variable ($script_root) without properly sanitizing or validating it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The `include()` function in `tell_a_friend.inc.php` includes a file based on the `$script_root` variable, which is potentially controllable by an attacker.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially include a malicious file from a remote location, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server, data breaches or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can manipulate the `$script_root` variable to point to a malicious file on a remote server via HTTP/HTTPS.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the `$script_root` variable, likely through a vulnerable parameter passed to the script."
