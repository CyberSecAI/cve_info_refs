### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly-discovered, privately-reported and public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own âVulnerability Detailsâ section.

An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. However, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities would most likely cause the affected system to stop responding.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Vulnerability Details

#### IP Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0048:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted IP message to an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to remotely execute code. However, attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service.

#### Mitigating Factors for IP Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0048:

* This attack requires that routers forward malformed IP network packets. Most routers will not forward these kinds of malformed IP network packets.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Affected systems that allow any IP connections to the Internet may be vulnerable to this issue.
* If enabled, the Internet Connection Firewall does mitigate this vulnerability on Windows XP Service Pack 1. Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 were not vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for IP Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0048:

* ISA Server 2000 and ISA Server 2004 can be used to block the affected types of traffic. Please review the ISA Server [Preventative Measures Documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/isa/2004/securityprotection/default.mspx) for more information on how to use ISA Server to help mitigate this vulnerability.
* **Use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP Service Pack 1.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP Service Pack 1 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.

#### FAQ for IP Validation Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0048:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. However, attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart. During that time, affected systems cannot respond to requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The affected operating systems perform incomplete validation of IP network packets.

**What is IP?**

The Internet Protocol (IP) is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40954).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. However, most likely, an attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and to automatically restart.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to execute code or stop responding.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 1 are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 provide additional validation that addresses this vulnerability.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. However, this attack requires that routers forward malformed IP network packets. Most routers will not forward these kinds of malformed IP network packets.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the affected operating systems validate IP requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0790:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message to an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to reset existing TCP connections.

#### Mitigating Factors for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0790:

* Firewall best practices and firewall or router configurations that block all ICMP traffic can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* For an attacker to try to exploit this vulnerability, they must first predict or learn the IP address and port information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection.
* This attack would have to be performed on each TCP connection that was targeted for reset. Many applications will automatically restore connections that have been reset.

#### Workarounds for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0790:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Block all ICMP network packets at the firewall or at the router:**

  ICMP network packets are used to initiate a connection with the affected components. Blocking them at the firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet. ISA Server 2000 and ISA Server 2004 can be used to block the affected types of traffic.

  **Impact of Workaround:** This workaround can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.
* **Block ICMP traffic by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

  **Impact of Workaround:** This workaround can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.

#### FAQ for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0790:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted ICMP message to an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to reset existing TCP connections. Those connections would have to be re-established for normal communication to continue. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or elevate their user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The affected messages are not being ignored in certain cases that allow an attacker to send a malformed packet which may cause the reset of an existing connection.

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40954).

**What is ICMP?**

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a required TCP/IP standard that is defined in RFC 792, "Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)." Hosts and routers that use IP communication can report errors and exchange limited control and status information using ICMP.

ICMP messages are usually sent automatically in one of the following situations:

* An IP datagram cannot reach its destination.
* An IP router (gateway) cannot forward datagrams at the current rate of transmission.
* An IP router redirects the sending host to a better route to the destination.

You can use the **ping** command to send ICMP echo request messages and to record the receipt of ICMP echo reply messages. By using these messages, you can detect network or host communication failures and troubleshoot common TCP/IP connectivity problems. For more information about ICMP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40955).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to reset TCP connections.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

#### ICMP Path MTU Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1060:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message to an affected system that could cause network performance to degrade and potentially stop the affected system from responding to requests.

#### Mitigating Factors for ICMP Path MTU Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1060:

* Firewall best practices and firewall or router configurations that block all ICMP traffic can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* For an attacker to try to exploit this vulnerability, they must first predict or learn the IP address information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection.

#### Workarounds for ICMP Path MTU Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1060:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable Path MTU Discovery.**

  Disabling Path MTU Discovery will prevent an attacker from specifying a low MTU value that could degrade network performance by following these steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedt32**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key: **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters**
  3. Add the DWORD Value: **EnablePMTUDiscovery**. Set the value to **0**. This value disables Path MTU Discovery. By default, this key does not exist.
  4. You must restart your system for this change to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround:** These changes will help prevent attacks restricting the ability of an attacker to reduce the Path MTU value to a low value. This setting can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. This optimization can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion. For more information about **EnablePMTUDiscovery**, see the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/58752.mspx).
* **Block all ICMP network packets at the firewall or at the router:**

  ICMP network packets are used to initiate a connection with the affected components. Blocking them at the firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet. ISA Server 2000 and ISA Server 2004 can be used to block the affected types of traffic.

  **Impact of Workaround:** This workaround can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.
* **Block ICMP traffic by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

  **Impact of Workaround:** This workaround can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.

#### FAQ for ICMP Path MTU Vulnerability - CAN-2004-1060:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message to an affected system that could cause network performance to degrade and potentially stop the affected system from responding to requests. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or elevate their user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The ICMP Path MTU Discovery process allows an attacker to specify a Path MTU value that can degrade network performance.

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40954).

**What is ICMP?**

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a required TCP/IP standard that is defined in RFC 792, "Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)." Hosts and routers that use IP communication can report errors and exchange limited control and status information using ICMP.

ICMP messages are usually sent automatically in one of the following situations:

* An IP datagram cannot reach its destination.
* An IP router (gateway) cannot forward datagrams at the current rate of transmission.
* An IP router redirects the sending host to a better route to the destination.

You can use the **ping** command to send ICMP echo request messages and to record the receipt of ICMP echo reply messages. By using these messages, you can detect network or host communication failures and troubleshoot common TCP/IP connectivity problems. For more information about ICMP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40955).

**What is Path MTU Discovery?**

Path maximum transmission unit (PMTU) discovery is the process of discovering the maximum size of packet that can be sent across the network between two hosts without fragmentation (that is, without the packet being broken into multiple frames during transmission). It is described in RFC 1191. For more information, see [RFC 1191](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1191.txt?number=1191). For additional information, see the following [MSDN Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms817967.aspx).

**What is wrong with the Path MTU Discovery process?**

Path maximum transmission unit (PMTU) discovery allows an attacker to specify a value that can degrade network performance for other connections. On unsecured networks, allowing PMTU discovery carries the risk that an attacker might force the MTU to a very small value and overwork the local system's TCP/IP stack. Normally this behavior would be restricted to the single connection that an attacker could establish. However, this vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the MTU value on other connections beyond their own connection to the affected system.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to degrade network performance.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to degrade network performance.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk from this vulnerability. However, servers are at primary risk from this vulnerability because they maintain connections with clients that could be vulnerable to performance degradation.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. By default, the Microsoft Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) allows these kinds of malicious network packets and cannot be used to filter them.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by restricting the minimum value of the MTU to 576 bytes. This update also modifies the way that the affected operating systems validate ICMP requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-1060.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### TCP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0230:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted TCP message to an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to reset existing TCP connections.

#### Mitigating Factors for TCP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0230:

* For an attacker to try to exploit this vulnerability, they must first predict or learn the IP address and port information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection. An attacker would also have to predict or to learn certain difficult TCP network packet details. Protocols or programs that maintain long sessions and have predictable TCP/IP information are at an increased risk for this issue.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Affected systems that allow any TCP connections to the Internet may be vulnerable to this issue.
* This attack would have to be performed on each TCP connection that was targeted for reset. Many applications will automatically restore connections that have been reset.

**Notes** The Windows XP security update is packaged as a dual-mode package. Dual-mode packages contain files for the original version of Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) and files for Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2).
For more information about dual-mode packages, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 328848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/328848).
When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:

* Windows XP SP2
  The installer copies the SP2QFE files to your system.
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)
  The installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system.

If you have not previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:

* Windows XP SP2
  The installer copies the SP2GDR files to your system.
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)
  The installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.

**Does this security update contain any non-security changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the "Vulnerability Details" section, this update includes the Teredo Interoperability update for Windows XP Service Pack 2. Windows Server 2003 does not support Teredo and is not receiving the Teredo functionality change.

**What is the Teredo interoperability update?**

IANA has allocated a new Teredo prefix 2001:0/32 for Teredo. In order to establish connectivity over Teredo between Windows XP Service Pack 2 IPv6 capable hosts and Windows Vista, the Teredo prefix is being revised on all Windows XP machines. To learn more about Teredo please visit the following [Microsoft TechNet documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/teredo.mspx). To learn more about the new Teredo prefix, please visit the following [RFC documentation](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4380.txt).

**Does this security update make any changes to the IPv4 implementation of TCP/IP?**

No. The security issues addressed by this bulletin have already been resolved in the corresponding IPv4 implementation of TCP/IP with the release of the [MS05-019](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms05-019).

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition ended on July 11, 2006. I am still using one of these operating systems; what should I do?**

Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition have reached the end of their support life cycles.

For more information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

For more detailed information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723).

## Vulnerability Details

#### ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CVE-2004-0790:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the IPv6 Windows implementation of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to drop an existing TCP connection.

#### Mitigating Factors for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CVE-2004-0790:

* Firewall best practices and firewall or router configurations that block all ICMP traffic can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* IPv6 support is not installed by default on Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.
* An attackerâs system must belong to the same IPv6 network as the target system.
* An attacker must first predict or discover the IP address and port information of the source and of the destination of an existing TCP network connection.
* This attack would have to be performed on each TCP connection that was targeted for reset. Many applications will automatically restore connections that have been reset.

#### Workarounds for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CVE-2004-0790:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Uninstall IPv6.**

  For the IPv6 protocol for Windows XP with SP2, Windows XP with SP1, or Windows Server 2003, do the following:

  1. Log on to the computer with a user account that has privileges to change network configuration.
  2. Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, and then double-click **Network Connections**.
  3. Click **Microsoft TCP/IP version 6** (for Windows XP with SP2 or Windows Server 2003) or **Microsoft IPv6 Developer Edition** (for Windows XP with SP1), and then click **Uninstall**.
  4. When prompted to confirm the removal of the Microsoft IPv6 Developer Edition or Microsoft TCP/IP version 6 protocol, click **OK**.

  **Alternately, from the Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 desktop do the following**:

  1. Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Accessories**.
  2. Click **Command Prompt**.
  3. At the command prompt, type **netsh interface ipv6 uninstall**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Uninstalling IPv6 would result in the system not being able to communicate with other hosts on an IPv6 configured network.
* **Block all ICMP network packets at the firewall or at the router:**

  ICMP network packets are used to initiate a connection with the affected components. Blocking them at the firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet.

  **Impact of Workaround:** This workaround can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.
  Note: Windows XP Service Pack 1 Firewall is unable to handle IPv6 network traffic. In order to ensure protection for your Windows XP Service Pack 1 system using the Internet Connection Firewall you should apply the update identified in [KB Article 817778 âOverview of the Advanced Networking Pack for Windows XPâ](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/817778).
* **Block ICMP traffic by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

  **Impact of Workaround:** This workaround can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.

#### FAQ for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CVE-2004-0790:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in Windows in the IPv6 implementation of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to drop an existing TCP connection.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Specially crafted ICMP packets are being parsed when they should be dropped which may cause the reset of an existing connection.

**What is IPv6?**

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), a new suite of standard protocols for the network layer of the Internet, is built into Microsoft Windows XP and later. IPv6 is designed to solve many of the problems of the current version of IP (known as IPv4) such as address depletion, security, autoconfiguration, and extensibility. To learn more about IPv6, please read the following [Microsoft FAQ for IPv6](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/network/ipv6/ipv6faq.mspx).

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40954).

**What is ICMP?**

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a required TCP/IP standard. "Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)." Hosts and routers that use IP communication can report errors and exchange limited control and status information using ICMP.
ICMP messages are usually sent automatically in one of the following situations:

* An IP datagram cannot reach its destination.
* An IP router (gateway) cannot forward datagrams at the current rate of transmission.
* An IP router redirects the sending host to a better route to the destination.

You can use the **ping** command to send ICMP echo request messages and to record the receipt of ICMP echo reply messages. By using these messages, you can detect network or host communication failures and troubleshoot common TCP/IP connectivity problems. For more information about ICMP, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40955).

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding for a limited time as a result of excessive CPU utilization. During that time, affected systems cannot respond to requests. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The affected operating systems perform incomplete validation of TCP/IP network packets. This vulnerability occurs when a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) SYN packet is received with a spoofed source Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number that is identical to that of the destination IP address and port. The effect of this makes it appear that the host computer has sent a packet to itself. If this attack is successful, a loop is created and extra computer CPU time is used.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the frequently asked question, âCan I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?â in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB922819\Filelist

  For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB922819\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**
This security update requires Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.

**Note** The security updates for Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 also apply to Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2.

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs**
The update for this issue will be included in future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and forces other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Displays a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstallation. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log: path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows Server 2003:

**Windowsserver2003-KB922819-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB922819.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows Server 2003:

**Windowsserver2003-KB922819-x86-enu /norestart**

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
