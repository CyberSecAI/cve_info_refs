[Download RAW [message](?l=full-disclosure&m=110928380421841&q=mbox) or [body](?l=full-disclosure&m=110928380421841&q=raw)]

Platform: Windows (tested only on XP and 2000, might impact others)
Application: GAIM v1.1.3
Synopsis: Cause remote crash of GAIM client.
Scenario:

By sending a file to another GAIM user, you can cause their GAIM client
to crash and completely close GAIM down.

Simply send a file to someone with parenthesis in it, and it will crash
when they accept the download (the download does not even begin, it just
crashes).

Example: filename of gaim1.1(windows).exe
will cause it to crash.

I am still playing with the debug version of GAIM, and having just run
through GTK updates to 2.4 I do not have time to digest and post those.
So far, it looks like it has to do with libglib-2.0-0.dll
I am following up with a post to GAIM developers with a complete report.
