# xv: Filename handling vulnerability — GLSA **200503-09**

xv contains a format string vulnerability, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/xv** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.10a-r10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.10a-r10** |

### Background

xv is an interactive image manipulation package for X11.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team identified a flaw
in the handling of image filenames by xv.

### Impact

Successful exploitation would require a victim to process a specially
crafted image with a malformed filename, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All xv users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/xv-3.10a-r10"
```
