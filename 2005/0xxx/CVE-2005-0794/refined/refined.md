The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in zPanel, a hosting control interface for Windows and Linux.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

1.  **SQL Injection #1:** Lack of sanitization of user input within the `index.php` script when handling the `uname` parameter in a SQL query.
2.  **SQL Injection #2 and File Inclusion:** Lack of sanitization of the `page` parameter in the `zpanel.php` script leading to SQL injection and arbitrary file inclusion.
3.  **Installation:** Unremoved installation scripts after installation completion.
4.  **Old Scripts:** Usage of outdated, potentially vulnerable scripts such as phpBB Forums 2.0.8a

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  In `index.php` and `zpanel.php`, unsanitized user input is directly used in SQL queries.
*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** In `zpanel.php`, the `page` parameter allows the inclusion of local files (v<=2.5 beta 10) and remote files (v2.0).
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Error messages reveal which authentication parameter is wrong, facilitating SQL injection attacks. Also path disclosure in case of unsuccessfull file inclusion.
*   **Insecure Defaults:** Installation scripts remain accessible after installation, and the inclusion of old scripts introduces vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Bypass authentication mechanisms.
    *   Access sensitive information, including non-encrypted passwords in zPanel v2 or MD5 hashes in zPanel v <= 2.5 beta 10.
*  **Arbitrary File Inclusion:**
    *   Execute arbitrary code by including malicious local or remote files.
    *   Full compromise of the server.
*   **Installation:**
    *   Potential for re-installation or manipulation of the system by accessing the install script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection #1:** Sending a crafted `uname` parameter via a POST request to `index.php`.
*   **SQL Injection #2 and File Inclusion:** Sending a crafted `page` parameter via a GET request to `zpanel.php`.
*   **Installation:** Accessing the `install.php` file via a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable zPanel instance.
*   No specific user credentials are required for exploiting SQL injection and file inclusion vulnerabilities.
*  For the installation script vulnerability, only network access is needed.

The vendor was notified of these issues and a fix was released in beta 11.
