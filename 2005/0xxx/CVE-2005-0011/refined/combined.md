How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# KStars: Buffer overflow in fliccd — GLSA **200502-23**

KStars is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could lead to arbitrary code
execution with elevated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **kde-base/kdeedu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.3.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.3.2-r1** |

### Background

KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems. KStars is a desktop planetarium for KDE.
It includes support for the Instrument Neutral Distributed Interface
(INDI).

### Description

Erik Sjolund discovered a buffer overflow in fliccd which is part
of the INDI support in KStars.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute code with
elevated privileges. If fliccd does not run as daemon remote
exploitation of this vulnerability is not possible. KDE as shipped by
Gentoo does not start the daemon in the default installation.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All KStars users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdeedu-3.3.2-r1"
```

Hash: SHA1
KDE Security Advisory: Buffer overflow in fliccd of kdeedu/kstars/indi
Original Release Date: 2005-02-15
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20050215-1.txt
0. References
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0011
1. Systems affected:
KDE 3.3 up to including KDE 3.3.2.
2. Overview:
KStars includes support for the Instrument Neutral Distributed
Interface (INDI). The build system of this extra 3rd party
software contained an installation hook to install fliccd (part
of INDI) as SUID root application.
Erik Sjölund discovered that the code contains several
vulnerabilities that allow stack based buffer overflows.
3. Impact:
If the fliccd binary is installed as suid root, it enables root
privilege escalation for local users, or, if the daemon is
actually running (which it does not by default) and is running
as root, remote root privilege escalation.
4. Solution:
Source code patches have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
5. Patch:
A patch for 3.3.2 is available from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security\_patches :
2b9c8330bec2c0dc6669ccc40b24dd70 post-3.3.2-kdeedu-kstars.diff
6. Time line and credits:
05/01/2005 Erik Sjölund notifies Debian Security.
07/01/2005 Martin Schulze from the Debian Security team
notifies KDE security team about the vulnerabilities.
09/01/2005 Dirk Mueller from KDE security team develops
a patch that addresses the discovered and similiar
vulnerabilities. Contacting Jasem Mutlaq, the
author of INDI.
21/01/2005 Regressions are discovered with the patch and
subsequently fixed over the next few days.
15/02/2005 Coordinated public disclosure.
