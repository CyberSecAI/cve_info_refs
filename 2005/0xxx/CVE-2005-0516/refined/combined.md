* TWiki robustness patch

After CAN-2004-1037 was discovered in November 2004, I wrote a patch
which systematically replaces unsafe subprocess invocation constructs
in the TWiki source code.  This patch was published, submitted to the
TWiki developers, and they ported it into the DEVELOP branch:

  <<http://www.enyo.de/fw/security/notes/twiki-robustness.html>>

(A TWiki release which incorporates the changes from the DEVELOP
branch is still pending.)

The TWiki robustness patch should fix all shell command injection
vulnerabilities, once and for all.  It also attempts to prevent
directory traversal attacks, but I'm less confident that I have
plugged all potential holes.  (However, I'm not aware of any directory
traversal vulnerabilities in TWiki, with or without this patch.)

Due to certain circumstances which I'm not at liberty to disclose at
this point, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to apply the patch to any TWiki
installation which is accessible from untrusted networks.  The patch
needs some changes to TWiki.cfg; please read the web page mentioned
above and the enclosed README file carefully.

* ImageGalleryPlugin security issue

ImageGalleryPlugin does not properly guard its configuration options
against unauthorized changes, in particular parts of the ImageMagick
commands used to generate thumbnails.  As a result, it's possible for
anyone who is able to create or edit topics with image galleries to
execute arbitrary shell commands on the web server hosting the
affected TWiki installation.

A patch for this issue is available from the same URL as above:

  <<http://www.enyo.de/fw/security/notes/twiki-robustness.html>>

The patch depends on the TWiki robustness patch.  Some configuration
changes are required (as explained on the web page).

# Increasing TWiki's Robustness Against Shell Command Injection

 **TWiki uses Perl's backtick operator in several places. The argument string of the backtick operator contains data from untrusted sources, causing potential security problems if shell metacharacters are involved. A patch to resolve these potential issues is provided.**

In the past, several vulnerabilities involving shell command injection had to be fixed in TWiki ([Metacharacters can be passed through to the shell in File Attach](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/NoShellCharacterEscapingInFileAttachComment)![ <http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/NoShellCharacterEscapingInFileAttachComment>](/fw/external.png), TWiki Security Alert, 2003-10-19; [TWiki search function allows arbitrary shell command execution](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/SecurityAlertExecuteCommandsWithSearch)![ <http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/SecurityAlertExecuteCommandsWithSearch>](/fw/external.png), TWiki Security Alert, 2004-11-13).

In order to correct the remaining potential issues and prevent further coding errors, the following patch introduces a replacement of Perl's backtick operator. This replacement constructs command line argument vectors in a safe way (by invoking the new subroutine `TWiki::buildCommandLine`). Execution of arbitrary shell commands directly through shell metacharacters is no longer possible if `TWiki::readFromProcess` or `TWiki::readFromProcessArray` are used. (Indirect command injection is still possible if vulnerable programs and scripts are invoked through this interface, though.)

* <https://static.enyo.de/fw/patches/twiki/twiki-robustness-r3342.diff>
* <https://static.enyo.de/fw/patches/twiki/twiki-robustness-r3342.Changelog>

The current patch is relative to TWiki's Subversion trunk (<http://ntwiki.ethermage.net:8181/svn/twiki/trunk>), revision 3248. The Changelog file contains summaries of the changes. Please also read the `README.robustness` file included in the patch, and keep in mind that you must edit your `TWiki.cfg` file.

> *Note:* This patch is known not to work with native Windows versions of TWiki.

* [For Developers: Increasing Robustness of Your Code](#1)
* [TWiki Plugins](#2)
* [Annoucements](#3)

## For Developers: Increasing Robustness of Your Code

With the following changes, your code can also benefit from the backtick replacement:

* Look for code of the following form:

  > ```
  >
  > my $result = `$program $file1 $file2`;
  >
  > ```

  Replace it with:

  > ```
  >
  > my $program = '/path/to/program %FILE1|F% %FILE2|F%';
  > [...]
  > my ($result, $exit) = TWiki::readFromProcess
  >     ($program, FILE1 => $file1, FILE2 => $file2);
  >
  > ```

  In this case, both `$file1` and `$file2` are files, so we use the `F` flag in the `$program` template.

  Make sure that `$program` is hard-coded in the source file or comes from `TWiki.cfg`. Deriving it from *topic content* (for example, using TWiki's preferences system) is *unsafe and dangerous!*

  Don't forget to check `$exit` for errors (the value contains the shell exit status). Note that `TWiki::readFromProcess` redirects standard error, so the output will include error messages.
* If you use the backtick operator in the following form, you should use `TWiki::readFromProcessArray` instead:

  > ```
  >
  > my @result = `$program $file1 $file2`;
  >
  > ```

  Changes this code to:

  > ```
  >
  > my $program = '/path/to/program';
  > my $template = '%FILE1|F% %FILE2|F%';
  > [...]
  > my @result = TWiki::readFromProcessArray
  >     ($program, $template, FILE1 => $file1, FILE2 => $file2);
  >
  > ```

  As you can see, the argument lists differs slightly from `TWiki::readFromProcess`: the program name is passed as a separate argument.

  Note that `TWiki::readFromProcessArray` does *not* redirect standard error. The caveat about `$program` mentioned above also applies to `TWiki::readFromProcessArray`, to both the `$program` and `$template` arguments.
* Also look for unsafe uses of the `qx//` operator (which is another form of the backtick operator).
* Examine calls to Perl's `open` function. If a subprocess is created, consider using the new safe pipes idiom of Perl 5.8 (see `man perlipc`), or use `TWiki::readFromProcess` or `TWiki::readFromProcessArray`.

  If `open` is called to open a regular file, you might want to add a call to `TWiki::normalizeFileName`. For example, change the following code:

  > ```
  >
  > my $handle;
  > open $handle, "< $root/$file";
  >
  > ```

  To:

  > ```
  >
  > my $handle;
  > $file = TWiki::normalizeFileName ($file);
  > open $handle, "< $file";
  >
  > ```

  `TWiki::normalizeFileName` will die if a directory traversal attempt is detected.
* Replace calls to Perl's `system` function with its safe variant (see the Perl documentation), or use `TWiki::readFromProcess` (and add proper error checking).
* There might be other operations which open files or spawn processes, and they might have unintuitive names. When using a particular Perl module, make sure that you do not allow TWiki users to pass data to them in dangerous ways. When in doubt, use `TWiki.cfg` for storing configuration values, and not topics with preference settings.
* Check for suspicious uses of `eval`. Use the `Safe` module if you cannot avoid mobile code. However, this is risky because `Safe` probably has some security holes left on its own which might enable malicious TWiki users to escape from the sandbox.

## TWiki Plugins

Some TWiki plugins have been checked against the list above. The results are given below.

* `ImageGalleryPlugin` enables anyone who can create or edit image galleries to execute arbitrary shell commands on the web server hosting TWiki. The patch below addresses this security hole. It depends on the TWiki robustness patch described above.

  + <https://static.enyo.de/fw/patches/twiki/imagegallery-robustness-20041128.diff>

  You must add the following configuration settings to `TWiki.cfg` before you apply the patch:

  > ```
  >
  > $ImageGalleryPlugin_CONVERT = '/usr/bin/convert -sample %RESIZE|N% %SOURCE|F% %TARGET|F%';
  > $ImageGalleryPlugin_IDENTIFY = '/usr/bin/identify %FILE|F%';
  >
  > ```

  The [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project](http://cve.mitre.org/)![ <http://cve.mitre.org/>](/fw/external.png) has assigned the name [CAN-2005-0516](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0516)![ <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0516>](/fw/external.png) to this issue.
* `ConditionalPlugin` uses the `Safe` module for sandboxing. This means that if you install it, you should quickly apply Perl patches which address vulnerabilities in the `Safe` module.
* `SpreadSheetPlugin` uses regular expressions to ensure that strings which are passed to `eval` are harmless. While I could not discover an exploit, this approach should be considered poor engineering from a security standpoint.

## Annoucements

Security-related changes in these patches will be announced on the [security-announce mailing list](https://lists.enyo.de/mailman/listinfo/security-announce/).

## Revisions

* 2004-11-28: published
* 2004-12-15: The patch is diffed against a newer TWiki trunk version (r3342). Perl 5.6 support is no longer intentionally removed.
* 2005-02-25: Updated checklist to include `eval`. Patch for ImageGalleryPlugin published.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
