# MySQL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-19**

MySQL contains several vulnerabilities potentially leading to the
overwriting of local files or to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.24** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.24** |

### Background

MySQL is a fast, multi-threaded, multi-user SQL database server.

### Description

MySQL fails to properly validate input for authenticated users with
INSERT and DELETE privileges (CAN-2005-0709 and CAN-2005-0710).
Furthermore MySQL uses predictable filenames when creating temporary
files with CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE (CAN-2005-0711).

### Impact

An attacker with INSERT and DELETE privileges could exploit this to
manipulate the mysql table or accessing libc calls, potentially leading
to the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running MySQL. An attacker with CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE privileges could
exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-4.0.24"
```

Package        : mysql
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2004-0957
BugTraq ID     : 12781
Debian Bug     : 285276 296674 300158

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in MySQL, a popular
database.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CAN-2004-0957

    Sergei Golubchik discovered a problem in the access handling for
    similar named databases.  If a user is granted privileges to a
    database with a name containing an underscore ("_"), the user also
    gains privileges to other databases with similar names.

CAN-2005-0709

    Stefano Di Paola discovered that MySQL allows remote
    authenticated users with INSERT and DELETE privileges to execute
    arbitrary code by using CREATE FUNCTION to access libc calls.

CAN-2005-0710

    Stefano Di Paola discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated
    users with INSERT and DELETE privileges to bypass library path
    restrictions and execute arbitrary libraries by using INSERT INTO
    to modify the mysql.func table.

CAN-2005-0711

   Stefano Di Paola discovered that MySQL uses predictable file names
   when creating temporary tables, which allows local users with
   CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE privileges to overwrite arbitrary files via
   a symlink attack.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.23.49-8.11.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.24-5 of mysql-dfsg and in version 4.1.10a-6 of
mysql-dfsg-4.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.
