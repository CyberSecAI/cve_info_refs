Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2005-0709:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Improper input validation in MySQL for authenticated users with INSERT and DELETE privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The vulnerability allows authenticated users with INSERT and DELETE privileges to execute arbitrary code by using CREATE FUNCTION to access libc calls.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker with the required privileges can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the MySQL server.

**Attack vectors:**

- Remote exploitation by authenticated users

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be a remote user with INSERT and DELETE privileges on the MySQL database.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability arises from insufficient input validation within MySQL, specifically when handling INSERT and DELETE operations by authenticated users. This flaw enables a malicious user to leverage `CREATE FUNCTION` in conjunction with libc calls to execute arbitrary code on the server. The attacker requires valid MySQL user credentials with INSERT and DELETE permissions to exploit this vulnerability remotely.
