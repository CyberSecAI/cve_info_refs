Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A] Crash caused by big descriptor ID:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The game uses a fixed-size array of 400 descriptors. However, clients can send descriptor IDs using 16-bit numbers (up to 65535).
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking on the received descriptor ID before accessing the array.
    *   **Impact:** Sending a descriptor ID greater than 399 results in an out-of-bounds array access, causing a server crash.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted network packet with a large descriptor ID to the server.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a client connected to the server.

*   **B] Crash caused by big claim_id:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Similar to the descriptor ID issue, a 16-bit claim\_id from the client is used to access a peers structure of 18 elements.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation for the received claim_id.
    *   **Impact:** Providing a large claim\_id results in an out-of-bounds access during a call to ANET\_AddrCompare(), causing the server to crash.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted network packet with a large claim\_id to the server.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a client connected to the server.

*  **C] Socket unreachable through empty packet:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The server uses FIONREAD to check for incoming data. An empty UDP packet results in FIONREAD continuously returning 0 bytes.
    *   **Weakness:** The server does not handle the case of an empty UDP packet, leading to an infinite loop.
    *   **Impact:** The server becomes unresponsive to new packets, effectively disconnecting all connected clients. The server recovers only when the map restarts, and a new socket is created.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending an empty UDP packet to the server.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can be any client or external entity that can send UDP packets to the server.

*   **D] Fake players temporary freeze:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The server freezes if too many players connect without sending further data, due to timeouts.
    *  **Weakness:** Insufficient handling of inactive or unresponsive clients.
    *  **Impact:** The server and all connected clients freeze, and no one can play when a new map starts after such attack.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Connecting multiple clients to the server without sending any data
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to connect multiple clients to the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect both Armagetron (<= 0.2.6.0) and Armagetron Advanced (<= 0.2.7.0).
*   The author of the report, Luigi Auriemma, provided proof-of-concept code for these bugs (A, B, C, and D).
*   The author reported the bugs A and D to the original developer, and the remaining bugs to the new developers, but there were no fixes.
