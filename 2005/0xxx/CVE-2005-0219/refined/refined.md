The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Gallery versions 1.3.4-pl1, 1.4.4-pl2, and 2.0 Alpha. It specifically focuses on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and an open redirection issue.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Gallery v1.3.4-pl1:**
        *   `add_comment.php`: The `index` field is vulnerable to XSS via HTML tag injection (`"><script>alert()</script>`).
        *   `slideshow_low.php`: All form fields (`set_albumName`, `slide_index`, `slide_full`, `slide_loop`, `slide_pause`, `slide_dir`) are vulnerable to XSS through HTML tag injection (`"><script>alert()</script>`).
        *  `search.php`: The `username` field is vulnerable to XSS using hex-encoded tag closing and an HTML event (`%22%20onactivate%3D"alert%28%29"`).
    *   **Gallery v1.4.4-pl2:**
        *   `login.php`: The `username` field is vulnerable to XSS via hex-encoded tag closing and an HTML event (`%22%20onactivate%3D"alert%28%29"`).
    *   **Gallery v2.0 Alpha:**
        *   `login.php`: The `g2_form[subject]` field is vulnerable to XSS through inline javascript protocol calls (`javascript:alert()`).
        
*  **Open Redirection:**
    *   **Gallery v1.4.4-pl2:**
         *   `do_command.php`: The `return` parameter allows for open redirection, where an attacker can redirect a user to an arbitrary website.

* **Information Disclosure:**
    * **Gallery v2.0 Alpha:**
        *   `main.php`: The `g2_subView` parameter allows an attacker to replace valid subview values with `core:UserAdmin`, causing the script to timeout after 30 seconds and output the full path of the gallery on the server in the error message.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the XSS vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the affected scripts. User-supplied input is directly included in the HTML output without being neutralized, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts. The open redirection is due to the lack of validation of the `return` parameter in the `do_command.php` script. The information disclosure is due to the possibility of forcing the gallery to execute code for another area and then timing out while outputting debug information.

**Impact:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   Remote attackers can inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser when they visit a vulnerable page.
    *   This can lead to:
        *   Automatic launching of malicious code (e.g., by exploiting browser vulnerabilities).
        *   Identity theft by using a spoofed login window.
*   **Open Redirection:**
    *   Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or phish them.
    *   This can be used to conduct attacks or waste server resources.
*  **Information Disclosure:**
    *  Attackers can obtain the full server path of the gallery, which can be used to aid further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   Crafted URLs containing malicious script payloads, which are then processed by vulnerable fields in the Gallery application.
*  **Open Redirection:**
    *   Crafted URLs with the vulnerable `return` parameter are used to direct users to a different location.
*  **Information Disclosure:**
    * Crafted URLs using the vulnerable `g2_subView` parameter.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS/Open Redirection/Information Disclosure:**
    *   Remote attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted URL to a user or tricking a user to visit a malicious link.
    *   The attacker only requires access to the internet and to be able to construct URLs.
