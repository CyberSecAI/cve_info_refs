  "CVE-2005-0602": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The Unix port of UnZip has a race-condition vulnerability, whereby a local attacker could change the permissions of the user's files during unpacking.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to UnZip not properly handling file permissions when extracting archives, allowing for a race condition.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race condition vulnerability",
        "Improper handling of file permissions"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker could potentially change the permissions of a user's files during the unpacking process, possibly leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to files.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access",
        "Exploitation during archive extraction"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to extract specially crafted zip archives. No specific user privileges are needed to execute the attack.",
       "more_info": "The vulnerability is present in the Unix port of UnZip. The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.52 with the new '-K' option being required to restore user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and sticky bits. The fix for the race condition will be present in version 6.00 for platforms with fchmod() system call"
