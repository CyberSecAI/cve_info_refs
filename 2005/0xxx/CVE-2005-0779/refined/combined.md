Application: PlantinumFTP
Site:        <http://www.roboshareware.com/indexplatinumftp.php>
Version:     1.0.18 and maybe lower
OS:          Windows
Bug:         Remote Denial of Service

=====
Product:
PlatinumFTPserver simplifies management of all your Ftp clients with
regards to sending and receiving program and data files over an IP
connection.

=====
About:
I didn't found any informations about the Bugs I've found and the
vendor doesn't seem to be interested in fixing problems (see History).
Since PlatinumFTP isn't a mainstream server I decided to make this
Disclosure.

Well, I found 3 different ways do shut down (denial of service) a
PlatinumFTP 1.0.18 server. At least you doesn't need a valid user

=====
First Bug:
You can stop the server using %s%s%s%s as username.

-------------------- schnipp --------------------

421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection
Login failed.
No control connection for command: Transport endpoint is not connected

Second Bug:
You can stop the server using %.1024d as username.

=====
Third Bug:
Well, shuting down a server using the third bug is, compared to the
first Bugs, really tricky *cough*. If you put in a \ as username the
Server will show a requester on his console saying 'Incorrect Format:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PlatinumFTPserver\Configuration\Users\'.
The ftp login process for the current session will stop until someone
affirmed this message.

I wrote a little perl script to see if it's possible to shut the server
down and it's working. You just have to connect a couple of times using
the username \ and after a few connections (>50) the server will crash.

Since most of you guys know how to write a script like that I doens't
attach it :) Of course you can find them later on my homepage.

=====
History:
2005-03-05: Found the Bugs and mailed the vendor
2005-03-07: Mailed the vendor again using all mailaddresse I found
2005-03-10: Created a yahoo-account *sigh* to make a forum post
2005-03-12: Still no response...

Well, now let's count the hours/days until someone is telling me I'm a
fool because I didn't made a working exploit out of it.
