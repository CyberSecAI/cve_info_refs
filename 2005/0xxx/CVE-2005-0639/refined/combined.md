| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-27 11:48:26 UTC  ``` xli and xloadimage use insufficient validation when parsing images, there is almost certainly a security issue waiting to be found in there somewhere that could be exploited by getting a user to display an image with one of these utilities (via gpg key photos, for example).  examples of insufficient validation:  ppm images are simple pixmap files, you can read about the format here:  <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html>  values arent verified very well, so setting illegal values can cause crazy behaviour, for example:  P6 1 1 # max_value can't be > 255 in a P6 (raw) ppm, this is illegal. # however, this will kill xli 256 FOOBAR  P3 1 1 # will SIGFPE xli 0e1 FOOBAR  P3 # this causes odd behaviour in xli and xloadimage, and calls malloc(0) 0 0 1 FOOBAR  P3 # allocating huge amounts of memory seems to cause some sort of race  # condition in xli. 9999 9999 1 FOOBAR  I've also noticed return codes from libpng are sometimes ignored, I'm not sure if that's such a good idea, it will happily try to display illegal png files, I've seen it segfault after this, although i no longer have the png file that caused it or a core file...if it happens again i'll try to track it down. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-08 06:56:29 UTC  ``` Look at these two examples I just tried:  P3 1073741825 4 16 FOOBAR  P3 65536 65536 16 FOOBAR  both overflow the value passed to malloc, and then die trying to copy the image data past the allocated buffer. I'm confident this could lead to an attack, I've emailed the author for his opinion. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-18 12:18:12 UTC  ``` xli suffers from a bug fixed in xloadimage in 2001:  details here: <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2001-07/0160.html>  rob@leet ~/projects/test/xli-1.17.0 $ xli ./foo.faces  ./foo.faces is a  32x32 8-bit grayscale Faces Project image xli: stack smashing attack in function facesLoad() Aborted ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-18 12:53:39 UTC  ``` There's also a quoting problem in xli's zio.c  sprintf(buf, "gunzip -c %s", name);  If a user were to use xli via ~/.mailcap or similar, someone could send a file with Content-Type set to image/jpeg and a filename like ';id 1>&2;: .Z', they could potentially execute arbitrary shell commands.  example:  $ touch ';id 1>&2;: .Z' $ xli ';id 1>&2;: .Z' gunzip: compressed data not read from a terminal.

Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CAN-2001-0775 CAN-2005-0638 CAN-2005-0639
BugTraq ID     : 3006
Debian Bug     : 298039

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in xli, an image viewer
for X11.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CAN-2001-0775

    A buffer overflow in the decoder for FACES format images could be
    exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.  This problem
    has been fixed in xloadimage in DSA 069 already.

CAN-2005-0638

    Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team has reported
    a flaw in the handling of compressed images, where shell
    meta-characters are not adequately escaped.

CAN-2005-0639

    Insufficient validation of image properties in have been
    discovered which could potentially result in buffer management
    errors.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.0-11woody1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.0-18.

We recommend that you upgrade your xli package.

# xli, xloadimage: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-05**

xli and xloadimage are vulnerable to multiple issues, potentially leading
to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/xloadimage** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.1-r2** |

| Package | **media-gfx/xli** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.17.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.17.0-r1** |

### Background

xli and xloadimage are X11 utilities for displaying and manipulating a
wide range of image formats.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team has reported that
xli and xloadimage contain a flaw in the handling of compressed images,
where shell meta-characters are not adequately escaped. Rob Holland of
the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team has reported that an xloadimage
vulnerability in the handling of Faces Project images discovered by
zen-parse in 2001 remained unpatched in xli. Additionally, it has been
reported that insufficient validation of image properties in xli could
potentially result in buffer management errors.

### Impact

Successful exploitation would permit a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary shell commands, or arbitrary code with the privileges of the
xloadimage or xli user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All xli users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/xli-1.17.0-r1"
```

All xloadimage users should also upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/xloadimage-4.1-r2"

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-27 11:48:26 UTC  ``` xli and xloadimage use insufficient validation when parsing images, there is almost certainly a security issue waiting to be found in there somewhere that could be exploited by getting a user to display an image with one of these utilities (via gpg key photos, for example).  examples of insufficient validation:  ppm images are simple pixmap files, you can read about the format here:  <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html>  values arent verified very well, so setting illegal values can cause crazy behaviour, for example:  P6 1 1 # max_value can't be > 255 in a P6 (raw) ppm, this is illegal. # however, this will kill xli 256 FOOBAR  P3 1 1 # will SIGFPE xli 0e1 FOOBAR  P3 # this causes odd behaviour in xli and xloadimage, and calls malloc(0) 0 0 1 FOOBAR  P3 # allocating huge amounts of memory seems to cause some sort of race  # condition in xli. 9999 9999 1 FOOBAR  I've also noticed return codes from libpng are sometimes ignored, I'm not sure if that's such a good idea, it will happily try to display illegal png files, I've seen it segfault after this, although i no longer have the png file that caused it or a core file...if it happens again i'll try to track it down. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-08 06:56:29 UTC  ``` Look at these two examples I just tried:  P3 1073741825 4 16 FOOBAR  P3 65536 65536 16 FOOBAR  both overflow the value passed to malloc, and then die trying to copy the image data past the allocated buffer. I'm confident this could lead to an attack, I've emailed the author for his opinion. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-18 12:18:12 UTC  ``` xli suffers from a bug fixed in xloadimage in 2001:  details here: <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2001-07/0160.html>  rob@leet ~/projects/test/xli-1.17.0 $ xli ./foo.faces  ./foo.faces is a  32x32 8-bit grayscale Faces Project image xli: stack smashing attack in function facesLoad() Aborted ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-18 12:53:39 UTC  ``` There's also a quoting problem in xli's zio.c  sprintf(buf, "gunzip -c %s", name);  If a user were to use xli via ~/.mailcap or similar, someone could send a file with Content-Type set to image/jpeg and a filename like ';id 1>&2;: .Z', they could potentially execute arbitrary shell commands.  example:  $ touch ';id 1>&2;: .Z' $ xli ';id 1>&2;: .Z' gunzip: compressed data not read from a terminal. Use -f to force decompression. For help, type: gunzip -h uid=1000(taviso) gid=100(users) groups=5(tty),10(wheel),16(cron),19(cdrom),35(games),100(users),250(portage) ;id 1>&2;: .Z: unknown or unsupported image type  This also seems to affect xloadimage. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-18 12:53:59 UTC  ``` upstreamn informed. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-23 12:45:53 UTC  ``` any news yet?
