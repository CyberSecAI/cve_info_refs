Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `highlight.php` file within the CIAMOS and RUNCMS content management systems (CMS) allows for the direct inclusion and display of arbitrary files when accessed via a crafted URL. Specifically, the file parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify a sensitive file, such as `mainfile.php`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to disclose the content of arbitrary files on the server, as the `file` parameter in the `highlight.php` script is not properly sanitized.
    *   **Lack of Access Control:** The `highlight.php` file does not implement proper access control, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can retrieve sensitive configuration details like:
        *   Database host, username, password, and database name.
        *   Installation paths.
        *   Other system configurations.
    *   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Database credentials exposed through this vulnerability could enable attackers to gain full control of the CMS and the associated database.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `highlight.php` script.
    *   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `file` parameter in the URL to specify the path to a file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target web server.
    *   **Knowledge of CMS Path:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path of the CMS installation, particularly the location of `highlight.php` and the configuration file (`mainfile.php`).
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker crafts a URL with the `highlight.php` script and the `file` parameter pointing to `mainfile.php`.
*   The vulnerable code does not properly validate the `file` parameter, allowing the script to include and output the contents of the specified file.
*   The output will typically include database credentials and paths, amongst other sensitive details.

**Affected Software:**

*   CIAMOS CMS (Specific versions not mentioned, but the advisory mentions a generic installation).
*   RUNCMS 1.1A
