The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in PostNuke versions 0.750 and 0.760-RC2, specifically within the `modules/Downloads/dl-search.php` file.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `$show` variable is directly used in the `$downloadsresults` variable without proper sanitization, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability when passed through the URL.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection due to lack of sanitization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The attacker can cause a fatal error leading to a denial of service.
    *   The attacker can use `INTO OUTFILE` to write PHP code into a web-accessible location, achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET request to `index.php?name=Downloads&req=search&query=[SEARCH_TERM]&show=[MALICIOUS_SQL]`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable application on the web and make HTTP requests.
    *   The attacker needs to know the full path to the web directory in order to leverage the `INTO OUTFILE` clause.
    *   The attacker must have a download entry with malicious php code in the "Description" or "Home page" field within the database.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `$orderby` variable is not properly sanitized in the `convertorderbyin()` function, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the `ORDER BY` clause.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection due to lack of sanitization in orderby parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   SQL Error.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET request to `index.php?name=Downloads&req=search&query=&orderby=[MALICIOUS_SQL]`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable application on the web and make HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The first vulnerability leverages the `INTO OUTFILE` MySQL function to write a PHP file to the server.
*   The exploit requires a pre-existing entry in the database with malicious PHP code in the "Description" or "Home page" fields.
*   The attacker needs to know the full path of the web directory.
