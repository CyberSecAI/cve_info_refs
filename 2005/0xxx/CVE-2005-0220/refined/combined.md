How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Gallery: Cross-site scripting vulnerability — GLSA **200501-45**

Gallery is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/gallery** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.4\_p6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.4\_p6** |

### Background

Gallery is a web application written in PHP which is used to organize
and publish photo albums. It allows multiple users to build and
maintain their own albums. It also supports the mirroring of images on
other servers.

### Description

Rafel Ivgi has discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability where
the 'username' parameter is not properly sanitized in 'login.php'.

### Impact

By sending a carefully crafted URL, an attacker can inject and execute
script code in the victim's browser window, and potentially compromise
the user's gallery.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Gallery users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/gallery-1.4.4_p6"
```

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.

| [Description](#c0)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-18 08:22:15 UTC  ``` TITLE: Gallery "username" Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability  SECUNIA ADVISORY ID: SA13887  VERIFY ADVISORY: <http://secunia.com/advisories/13887/>  CRITICAL: Less critical  IMPACT: Cross Site Scripting  WHERE: >From remote  SOFTWARE: Gallery 1.x <http://secunia.com/product/1933/>  DESCRIPTION: Rafel Ivgi has discovered a vulnerability in Gallery, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.  Input passed to the "username" parameter in "login.php" isn't properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  The vulnerability has been confirmed on version 1.4.4-pl4. Other versions may also be affected.  SOLUTION: Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.  PROVIDED AND/OR DISCOVERED BY: Rafel Ivgi  ORIGINAL ADVISORY: <http://theinsider.deep-ice.com/texts/advisory69.txt> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-18 09:24:00 UTC  ``` Good catch Lewk, didn't notice that Secunia changed the affected versions from the initial advisory.  web-apps please verify and advise. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-18 16:57:00 UTC  ``` I confirmed this with upstream, and -pl5 will be getting released shortly with these fixes. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-19 01:31:24 UTC  ``` From Debian Security Advisory DSA 642-1  CAN-2004-1106     Jim Paris discovered a cross site scripting vulnerability which     allows code to be inserted by using specially formed URLs.  CVE-NOMATCH     The upstream developers of gallery have fixed several cases of     possible variable injection that could trick gallery to unintended     actions, e.g. leaking database passwords.  Please make sure this is the same and/or it's fixed too :) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-22 04:26:57 UTC  ``` CAN-2004-1106 has been advised in GLSA 200411-10. I assume that the CVE-NOMATCH issue koon mentioned is already fixed since we are using a way newer version of gallery then debian does. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Stuart Herbert (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-23 08:38:37 UTC  ``` This isn't going to get fixed quickly.  Gallery relies on an older version of ImageMagick which has recently disappeared from the tree ... :(  Best regards, Stu ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Stuart Herbert (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-23 08:47:48 UTC  ``` When CVS returns, I will package-mask Gallery for now.  Best regards, Stu ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-23 10:28:22 UTC  ``` XSS downgrading severity. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-26 05:24:25 UTC  ``` <http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=147&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0>  Gallery 1.4.4-pl5 is out. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Chris Kelly    2005-01-26 08:01:39 UTC  ``` 1.4.4-pl5 fixes both the XSS and the issue with ImageMagick.  Nothing probably needs to change in the ebuild aside from the version number. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-27 06:36:52 UTC  ``` web-apps: please unmask and bump ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-29 13:21:46 UTC  ``` Looks like swtaylor bumped the ebuild, all arches are marked stable, good catch lewk. Pls enter a changelog entry and post to the bug next time, makes keeping track a little easier.  Moving to glsa status since maintainer kept keywords. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-31 01:09:02 UTC  ``` GLSA 200501-45 by lewk ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-02 16:17:20 UTC  ``` Apparently Gallery is still vulnerable?  <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/389270>  web-apps, please verify and advise. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-07 18:12:34 UTC  ``` - - - The recent release of 1.4.4-pl5 was meant to resolve some security problems, however after another analysis of the code the fix did not actually fix what it was intended to. 1.4.4-pl6 is now available and should properly fix the security problems. Please see the 1.4.4-pl5 announcement for more information about the security problems.  All Gallery users are strongly urged to upgrade to 1.4.4-pl6 immediately, which fixes this problem and will secure your system.  Gallery 1.4.4-pl6 can be downloaded from <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7130>  -Chris Gallery Project Manager - - -  web-apps, please bump. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  James Gilliland    2005-02-07 18:19:41 UTC  ``` <http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=149&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0> gallery 1.4.4-pl6 released This should fix the unfixed bug ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-10 06:05:28 UTC  ``` swtaylor strikes again!  He bumped -pl6 a few days ago, and retained keywords.  Moving to GLSA status. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-10 06:53:54 UTC  ``` Security, please vote ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-10 08:16:34 UTC  ``` I vote YES for an update to the old GLSA. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-10 08:23:37 UTC  ``` I will write and UPDATE glsa. ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-10 09:47:17 UTC  ``` GLSA 200501-45 has been updated, and an UPDATE GLSA sent. ``` |  |
