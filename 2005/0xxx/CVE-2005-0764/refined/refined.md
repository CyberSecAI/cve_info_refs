The provided content relates to CVE-2005-0764.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in rxvt-unicode when handling escape sequences. The `command.C` file fails to properly check the input length when processing an escape code followed by a text sequence, specifically when processing escape+P sequence.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow due to insufficient input length validation.
- Integer promotion issues in the original patch attempt.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running rxvt-unicode. Specifically, the overflow allows overwriting 6144 bytes on the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted escape sequence followed by a large amount of text to the rxvt-unicode terminal. This can be done by sending the input through a file or through other means.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send data to the rxvt-unicode application.
The attacker does not need to be local. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
