Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0687:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `hashcash` utility has a format string vulnerability when printing the header. Specifically, the recipient field is vulnerable to format string attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Format string vulnerability: The program uses a user-controlled string as the format string in a `printf` or similar function call. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`, `%s`) that can read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the program to crash, disrupt logs, or exhaust memory by using large field widths (e.g., `%.5000000x`). This can prevent legitimate hashcash users from participating in discussions.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Under certain circumstances, the format string vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The provided information doesn't give specifics, but the vulnerability exists.

**Attack vectors:**

-  By specifying a malformed reply address using the `-r` command line option with format string specifiers, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability. For example,  `hashcash -qm -b 8 -r "foo%.5000000x" -X < /dev/null`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted recipient field to the hashcash command.
- This can be done through command-line parameters (as shown in the example).

**Additional details:**

- A patch was created and committed to address the vulnerability, resolving the format string issue.
- The vulnerability was identified by Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team.
- Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA) 200503-12 was issued to address this issue.
- The vulnerability is considered remotely exploitable.
