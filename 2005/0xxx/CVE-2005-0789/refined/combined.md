How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# LimeWire: Disclosure of sensitive information — GLSA **200503-37**

Two vulnerabilities in LimeWire can be exploited to disclose sensitive
information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-p2p/limewire** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.8.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.8.1** |

### Background

LimeWire is a Java peer-to-peer client compatible with the
Gnutella file-sharing protocol.

### Description

Two input validation errors were found in the handling of Gnutella
GET requests (CAN-2005-0788) and magnet requests (CAN-2005-0789).

### Impact

A remote attacker can craft a specific Gnutella GET request or use
directory traversal on magnet requests to read arbitrary files on the
system with the rights of the user running LimeWire.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All LimeWire users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-p2p/limewire-4.8.1"
```

Summary:
Recent versions of the LimeWire client contain vulnerabilities that allow a remote \
user access to many or all files on a users machine. LimeWire is a popular client for \
the Gnutella filesharing network.

Vulnerability 1 - Inappropriate Handling of "resource get" requests.

Symptom:A remote attacker can request and read any file on a host running an affected \
version of LimeWire. Gnutella "push style" requests also vulnerable under most \
conditions, and therefore a local firewall does not prevent the attack. The files \
accessible to a remote attacker include all of the user's private, local files, and \
any file on the machine if the user has administrator privileges, a common scenario \
in Windows.

Versions affected: LimeWire versions 4.1.2 - 4.5.6, inclusive.

Details: The handling of "resource get" requests is the immediate cause of the \
problem. A request of the form "/gnutella/res/[filename]" returns the named file. For \
example, one can telnet to a LimeWire client using the default LimeWire port and type \
the following text:

GET /gnutella/res/C:\Windows\win.ini HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: I-AM-AN-ATTACKER/1.0
Host: 0.0.0.0:0
Accept: */*
Connection: Keep-Alive

The result is that the LimeWire client reads the file "C:\Windows\win.ini" and sends \
it over the network. Similarly, the attacker may request "/gnutella/res//etc/passwd" \
on Linux or unix-based machines. This attack has been tested and confirmed on Linux \
and Windows 2000 platforms.

Remedies: This problem has been fixed in the recently released LimeWire versions \
4.6.0 and later, which were released promptly by Lime Wire LLC after we informed them \
of the vulnerability.

Vulnerability 02 - Inappropriate Handling of "magnet" requests.

Symptom:A remote attacker can request and read any file on a host running an affected \
version of LimeWire. The attacker need only be able to connect to the LimeWire client \
"magnet" TCP port (default port, or a port chosen from a modest range if default is \
not available). Gnutella "push style" requests are not vulnerable, so a firewall that \
blocks access to the magnet port blocks the attack. The files accessible to a remote \
attacker include all of the user's private, local files, and any file on the machine \
if the user has administrator privileges.

Versions affected: LimeWire versions 3.9.6 - 4.6.0, inclusive.

Details: Details: The handling of "magnet" requests is the immediate cause of the \
problem. A request of the form "/magnet10/[rel-filename]" returns the named file, \
relative to the "root" subdirectory of the LimeWire installation, regardless of if it \
is in the "root" directory, or indeed even part of the Limewire package. For example, \
one can telnet to a LimeWire client and issue an HTTP request  GET \
/magnet10/../../../../../Windows/Win.ini?Simple-test

This example assumes that LimeWire is installed in its default installation \
directory. The result is that the LimeWire client reads the file "C:\Windows\win.ini" \
and sends it over the network. Similarly attacks work on Linux or unix-based \
machines. The attack has been tested and confirmed on Linux and Windows 2000 \
platforms, using several versions of LimeWire.

Remedies: This problem has been fixed in the recently released LimeWire versions \
4.8.0 and later, which were released promptly by Lime Wire LLC after we informed them \
of the vulnerability.
