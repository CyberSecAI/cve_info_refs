      "description": "A privilege elevation vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that Internet Explorer handles drag-and-drop events. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page. This malicious Web page could potentially allow an attacker to save a file on the user’s system if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
