  "CVE-2005-0555": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles Content Advisor files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Content Advisor file. This malicious Content Advisor file could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message and accepted the installation of the file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the routines that handle Content Advisor files in Internet Explorer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the current user, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system, if the user has administrative privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web page with a malicious Content Advisor file",
      "HTML email message with a malicious Content Advisor file (.rat)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to persuade a user to visit a malicious web page, or open a malicious email and then click through a series of Content Advisor setup windows."
