How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## The Apache™ Batik Project

# Apache™ Batik SVG Toolkit

## Overview

Batik is a Java-based toolkit for applications or applets that want to use images in the [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/) format for various purposes, such as display, generation or manipulation.

The projectâs ambition is to give developers a set of [core modules](using/architecture.html#coreComponents) that can be used together or individually to support specific SVG solutions. Examples of [modules](using/index.html) are the [SVG Parser](using/parsers.html), the [SVG Generator](using/svg-generator.html) and the [SVG DOM](using/dom-api.html). Another ambition for the Batik project is to make it highly [extensible](using/extending.html) âfor example, Batik allows the developer to handle custom SVG elements. Even though the goal of the project is to provide a set of core modules, one of the deliverables is a full fledged [SVG browser](tools/browser.html) implementation which validates the various modules and their inter-operability.

## What Batik can be used for

![Batik use cases](images/batikUses.jpg)

With Batik, you can manipulate SVG documents anywhere Java is available. You can also use the various [Batik modules](using/index.html) to [generate](using/svg-generator.html), [manipulate](using/dom-api.html) and [transcode](using/transcoder.html) SVG images in your applications or applets.

Batik makes it easy for Java based applications or applets to deal with SVG content. For example, using Batikâs [SVG generator module](using/svg-generator.html), a Java application or applet can very easily export its graphics into the SVG format. Using Batikâs [SVG viewing component](using/swing.html), an application or applet can very easily integrate SVG viewing and interaction capabilities. Another possibility is to use Batikâs modules to convert SVG to various formats, such as raster images (JPEG,PNGorTIFF) or other vector formats (EPSorPDF, the latter two due to the transcoders provided by [Apache FOP](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/)).

The Batik toolkit includes the following:

**Modules**

* An [SVG DOM implementation](using/dom-api.html)
* A set of [SVG microsyntax parsers](using/parsers.html)
* A [scripting module](using/scripting/ecmascript.html)
* A [generator](using/svg-generator.html) that creates an SVG document from Java2D calls
* A [Swing SVG component](using/swing.html)
* A [transcoder module](using/transcoder.html)

**Tools and applications**

* Squiggle, an [SVG browser](tools/browser.html)
* An [SVG rasterizer](tools/rasterizer.html)
* A [to SVG converter](tools/font-converter.html)
* A [pretty printer](tools/pretty-printer.html) for SVG source files

See [examples of projects and products using Batik](uses.html) for real-life example of how Batik is already integrated in projects and products.

## The SVG specification

Scalable Vector Graphics, SVG, is a [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) Recommendation. It defines an XML grammar for rich 2D graphics which includes features such as transparency, arbitrary geometry, filter effects (shadows, lighting effects, etc.), scripting and animation.

The SVG specification states:

This specification defines the features and syntax for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics in XML [ [XML10](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml) ]. SVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves), images and text. Graphical objects can be grouped, styled, transformed and composited into previously rendered objects. The feature set includes nested transformations, clipping paths, alpha masks, filter effects and template objects.

SVG documents can be interactive and dynamic. Animations can be defined and triggered either declaratively (i.e., by embedding SVG animation elements in SVG content) or via scripting.

## Implementation status

The latest revision of Batik, release 1.18, is a conformant [static SVG implementation](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/conform.html#ConformingSVGViewers) and supports [interactivity](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/interact.html), [linking](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/linking.html) and [scripting](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/script.html) features of the SVG specification. This release supports a nearly complete implementation of declarative [animation](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html), too.

See the [status](status.html) page for a detailed description of the set of SVG features Batik supports.
