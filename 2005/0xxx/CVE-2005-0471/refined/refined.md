  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The Sun Java Plugin creates temporary files with predictable short file names, discarding randomized strings used in long file names.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Predictable temporary file names",
		"Use of short file names (8.3 format) that are easier to predict"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could create arbitrary content in a known location on a user's system. This ability can be used in conjunction with other exploits.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote users can exploit the predictable filename generation."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to run code through the Java plugin and be able to predict the generated short filenames to create arbitrary file data.",
	  "additional_details": "The Java plugin creates temporary files in a known location. Normally, these files have randomized strings in their long file names to prevent guessing. However, the short file name, for compatibility with older FAT file systems, discards the randomized part, making these names predictable."
