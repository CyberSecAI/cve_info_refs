## Microsoft Jet Database Engine fails to properly validate Access database files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#176380

Original Release Date: 2005-10-03 | Last Revised: 2005-10-03

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Microsoft Jet database engine could allow a remote attacker to execute code of their choice on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Microsoft Jet Database Engine (Jet) provides data access functionality to a number of other Microsoft and many third party applications. An input validation error in the way that the Jet engine library handles the database files used by Microsoft Access (.mdb files) results in a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to execute code on a vulnerable system. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need the ability to supply a specially crafted .mdb file and coax or trick a user into opening it. The malicious .mdb file could be supplied remotely by a number of methods including, but not limited to, a web page, an email message, or a shared network folder. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to supply a specially crafted .mdb file could execute code of their choice on a vulnerable system. The attacker-supplied code would be executed with the same privileges as the user context of the application using the Jet Database Engine. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  Avoid opening Microsoft Access Database (.mdb) files from untrusted sources. |

Microsoft Jet DB engine vulnerabilities

Classification:
===============
Level: low-med-[HIGH]-crit
ID: HEXVIEW*2005*03*31*1
URL: <http://www.hexview.com/docs/20050331-1.txt>

Overview:
=========
Microsoft Jet database is a lightweight database widely used by MS Office
applications. msjet40.dll is the main component of the Microsoft Jet database
engine which evaluates and carries out requests for data. The library handles
reading and writing of the data for Microsoft Access databases. HexView
noticed multiple occurrences where file data was not validated or improperly
validated leading to system crashes, null pointer memory access conditions, and
arbitrary code execution. This advisory is focused on just one vulnerability
that we confirmed to be exploitable.

Affected products:
==================
All tests were performed using the latest avaliable msjet40.dll library
(version 4.00.8618.0). We did not test earlier versions, but it should be
assumed that all earlier releases of the library are also vulnerable. Please
note that MS JetDB OLE Provider (msjetoledb40.dll) is not affected by this
problem. Only software products that utilize msjet40.dll are affected,
including Microsoft Access.

Cause and Effect:
=================
Sufficient data validation is not performed when msjet40.dll parses the
database file. As a result, it is possible to modify database file to cause
a code of attacker's choice to be launched when MS Jet database is opened.

Demonstration:
==============
Below is a fragment of an empty *.mdb file. Note the sequence of 0x77
characters on line #3. When msjet40.dll parses this part of the file, it
triggers an exception.

000023B0:  00 00 04 00-49 00 64 00-18 00 50 00-61 00 72 00  ....I.d...P.a.r.
000023C0:  65 00 6E 00-74 00 49 00-64 00 4E 00-61 00 6D 00  e.n.t.I.d.N.a.m.
000023D0:  65 00 77 77-77 77 00 00-05 06 00 00-08 00 02 06  e.wwww..........
000023E0:  00 00 03 06-00 00 0D 00-08 06 00 00-09 06 00 00  ................
000023F0:  10 00 0E 06-00 00 0F 06-00 00 0F 00-0C 06 00 00  ................

Explanation:
============
Below is a code fragment from msjet40.dll that is responsible for the crash.
Atacker directly controls the value of AX. The value goes through a signed
expansion that is used to access 32-bit pointer to the variable that stores
the address of a call table.

  movsx   eax, ax
  mov     ecx, [edi+eax*4+0B0h]
  mov     edx, [ecx]
  call    dword ptr [edx+10h]

The accessible memory range contains portions of original file, which makes
possible to load instruction pointer with the value pointing to malicious
code embedded in the document. The issue is trivial to exploit and the
exploit is very portable as the attacker does not need to know absolute code
addresses.

Vendor Status:
==============
Microsoft was notified on March 30, 2005. Message acknowledged by an
automated reply. No human response received.

HexView Disclosure Policy:
==========================
HexView notifies vendors with publicly available contact e-mail addresses
24 hours before disclosing any information to the public. If we are unable
to find vendor's e-mail address or if no human reply is received within 24
hours, HexView will publish vulnerability notification including all technical

the vulnerability, but will not disclose the details required to reproduce it.
HexView will also specify the date when a full disclosure containing all the
details will be published. The time period between the announcement and full
disclosure is 30 days unless there is an agreement with vendor and appropriate
justification for extension. If vendor resolves the issue earlier than 30 days
after announcement, HexView may publish full disclosure earlier providing that
vendor's patch is available to the public.

# The Importance of Black Box Fuzzing in Key Industries Guide

This guide shares the key industries that would benefit the most from black box fuzzing to protect their Internet of Things products.

*The Importance of Black Box Fuzzing in Key Industries* guide is an in-depth look at various important industries that need a Black Box Fuzzing tool.  These industries produce apps and software for connected Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices and must keep them protected from a cyberattack.

### Securing Code in Key Industries With Black Box Fuzzing

Industries like automotive, aviation, and medical that produce apps and software for “smart” devices in cars, planes and medical devices must have stringent security to prevent catastrophic breaches. Black Box Fuzzing tools become crucial to securing the software development lifecycle (SDLC).  Cyberattacks on these devices can cause massive damage, which is why regulations require black box fuzzing to help ensure code security.
