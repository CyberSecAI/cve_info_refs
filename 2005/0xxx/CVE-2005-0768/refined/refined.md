- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the administration web server of GoodTech Telnet Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The web server, which runs on port 2380, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when it receives a very long string (10040 bytes) ending with two newline characters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with LOCAL_SYSTEM privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted string of 10040 bytes followed by two new line characters sent to the vulnerable web server running on the default port 2380.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server on port 2380 and the ability to send the crafted malicious string.
