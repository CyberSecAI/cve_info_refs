Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-0950

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input validation in the FastStone 4in1 Browser's built-in web server. Specifically, the server fails to properly sanitize or filter directory traversal sequences within HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks because it doesn't handle patterns like `\..\`, `../` or `/.../` correctly in HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Access: An attacker can view and download any file accessible to the web server's process. This could include sensitive system files like configuration files or user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Requests: The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests that contain directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server running the FastStone 4in1 Browser. They must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server component.

**Technical Details:**
- The application has default checks to avoid "/../" sequences but does not handle:
    - `\..\`
    - `../`
    - `/.../`

- Example attack URLs:
   - `http://[host]/.../.../.../.../.../.../windows/system.ini`
   - `http://[host]/..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\windows/system.ini`
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.2 of the application.
- The vendor was contacted and fixed the bug in version 1.3.
