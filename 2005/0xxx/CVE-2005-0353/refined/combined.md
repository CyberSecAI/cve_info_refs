## SafeNet Sentinel License Manager vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#108790

Original Release Date: 2005-03-08 | Last Revised: 2005-03-14

---

### Overview

SafeNet Sentinel License Manager contains a buffer overflow vulnerability, which may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

### Description

| SafeNet Sentinel License Manager (LM) is a software-based license management application. It is reported that the "Lservnt" service in Sentinel LM 7.2.0.2 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. By sending a large amount of data to UDP port 5093, an attacker may be able to overwrite the contents of the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) register, thus gaining control of program execution flow. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the Sentinel LM server with the rights of the service. Sentinel LM runs as "SYSTEM" by default on Windows systems. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch or upgrade**  According to the [CIRT.DK advisory](http://www.cirt.dk/advisories/cirt-30-advisory.pdf), this issue is resolved in Sentinel License Manager 8.0 |
| --- |

| **Block port 5093/udp**As a workaround, system administrators can use a firewall to block port 5093/udp at an appropriate network border, thus preventing external attackers from exploiting this vulnerability. Note that this will not prevent an attack from within the local network. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Application overview:

            Sentinel LM is a software-based license management application
allowing application developers to implement multiple pre-built license
models with a single software development integration effort. Developers can
sell or deliver multiple license types simply by changing the license file
associated with the application sold, reducing development time and
facilitating software management of a single code base per release.

Application Risk:   High
Internet Risk:        Medium (UDP)

Exploit Credits :    class101

Hole History:

                07-3-2005: BOF flaw published by Dennis Rand of CIRT.DK
                09-3-2005: hat-squad's exploit done
                13-3-2005: hat-squad's exploit released

Notes:

      -the exploit targets 5093/UDP
      -no bad chars detected
      -Unlike it is said in the CIRT.DK advisory, you shouldn't submit
3000bytes of data, but indeed, the overflow is occuring at around 3900
bytes. SentinelLM will proceed the first 1035bytes of your buffer and will
repeat those until the override of the stack.
Conclusion , you have to be good with maths (nor to control our friend olly
& calc :>) to overwrite the right place in your buffer[1035] to finally
reach eip when your buffer "autogrows" at around buffer[3940].
      -sending the buffer twice because the 1st attempt can fail sometimes.
      -using a nice popopret outside of a loaded module for SP2and2k3
targets.
this offset has been tested on SP2 and 2003 ENGLISH (maybe langage-dependent
dunno..)
      -to note so that target3 (SP2/2k3) can work sometimes as target2
(SP1a/1/0) but it is not stable this is why I use one of the two I have
posted at fulldisclosure (0x71ABE325/SP1a/1/0). This last is stable for the
3 sp (ENGLISH!).

Compilation:

                  101_SentLM.cpp ......... Win32 (MSVC,cygwin)
                  101_SentLM.c ........... Linux (FreeBSD,etc..)

 *Another fine working code, published as a patch warning or for an
EXPERIMENTAL use!*

The security flaw
When sending a large amount of data to the SentinelLM service, it will
result in a buffer overflow
where the Extended Instruction Pointer are overwritten, allowing arbitrary
code being run on the server,
with the rights of the service.
