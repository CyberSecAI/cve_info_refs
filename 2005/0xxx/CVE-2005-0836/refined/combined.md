How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Jan Brinkmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-18 11:37:17 UTC  ``` OVERVIEW ========  Java Web Start is a technology for easy client-side deployment of Java applications. "Using Java Web Start technology, standalone Java software applications can be deployed with a single click over the network" (from Sun Microsystems's website).  Java Web Start is installed with Java Runtime Environment (JRE). During installation, file type associations are added to make web browsers automatically (with a single click) open Java Web Start's .JNLP files (the behavior may vary between different web browsers).  There is a vulnerability in the way Web Start handles Java system properties defined in JNLP files. A malicious user can pass command line arguments to the Java virtual machine. They can be used to disable the Java "sandbox" and compromise the system. The attack can be carried out when the victim user views a web page crafted by the attacker.  [...]  VULNERABLE VERSIONS ===================  Java Web Start in J2SE 1.4.2 releases prior 1.4.2_07 are vulnerable. J2SE 5.0 and later, and releases prior to 1.4.2 are NOT vulnerable.   [...]  The complete message can be found here:  <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2005-March/032687.html>   1.4.2_07 is already in the tree. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-18 11:53:50 UTC  ``` Would the sun-jre also be affected ? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Jan Brinkmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-18 11:58:26 UTC  ``` i think so, since the jre also provides javaws (the java webstart binary) ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-24 13:45:51 UTC  ``` GLSA 200503-28 ``` |  |

# Java Web Start argument injection vulnerability

### Overview

Java Web Start is a technology for easy client-side deployment of Java applications. “Using Java Web Start technology, standalone Java software applications can be deployed with a single click over the network” (from Sun Microsystems’s website).

Java Web Start is installed with Java Runtime Environment (JRE). During installation, file type associations are added to make web browsers automatically (with a single click) open Java Web Start’s .JNLP files (the behavior may vary between different web browsers).

There is a vulnerability in the way Web Start handles Java system properties defined in JNLP files. A malicious user can pass command line arguments to the Java virtual machine. They can be used to disable the Java “sandbox” and compromise the system. The attack can be carried out when the victim user views a web page crafted by the attacker.

### Details

The <property> tag in a JNLP file can be used to define Java system properties. System properties are key-value pairs which usually store attributes of the current working environment, e.g. “java.home” containing the Java installation path and “java.version” containing its version. Due to the nature of some of the system properties, setting their values in JNLP files is restricted.

A few system properties are considered “secure” and if defined in a JNLP file, they are passed to the Java executable (javaw.exe) via the -Dproperty=value command line argument. However, a malicious user can use this feature to inject extra command line arguments to the Java executable.

For instance, a JNLP file can contain this property tag:

```
  <property name="sun.java2d.noddraw" value="true HELLO" />

```

The property “sun.java2d.noddraw” is considered secure by Web Start, so it is accepted and the startup command for the application is something like this:

```
 javaw.exe -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true HELLO (other args) your.application

```

This would produce a Web Start error message saying the main class can’t be found, as javaw.exe interprets “HELLO” as the main class name instead of “your.application”. The problem is that Web Start fails to use quote symbols around the property argument.

To exploit the flaw, an attacker can pass command line arguments affecting the Java security policies. Normally an unsigned, untrusted Java application operates inside a “sandbox” and can’t e.g. access local files. By exploiting this flaw, the default “sandbox” security policy can be overridden with an arbitrary policy file hosted on the attacker’s web server. The new policy can grant full permissions to the application, which could then e.g. read or write arbitrary files on the victim system, or download and launch viruses, keyloggers or other malware. The attacker may set up a JNLP file on a web server so that it will be launched without further user interaction when the victim visits the site, e.g. with the IFRAME tag.

As the application is made in Java, the same exploit can work on any platform supporting Java Web Start. A proof-of-concept exploit was produced which detects the operating system and starts an OS-dependant binary executable when a web page is visited – the same exploit works with Internet Explorer on Windows and Mozilla Firefox and Opera on Linux.

If Internet Explorer is used, the JNLP file is opened automatically without further interaction. Other web browsers may, depending on file type configuration, display a dialogue asking whether the file should be opened or saved. Some versions of e.g. Opera require manual configuration in order to open JNLP files.

In addition to the web browser attack vector, the attacker could replace an existing JNLP file on a web site with a malicious one. Web Start applications can be started from desktop shortcut icons, from the Web Start menu, or from command line. All of these starting methods are suspectible to the attack.

### Vulnerable versions

Java Web Start in J2SE 1.4.2 releases prior 1.4.2\_07 are vulnerable. J2SE 5.0 and later, and releases prior to 1.4.2 are NOT vulnerable.

### Solution

Sun Microsystems was informed about the problem on September 25, 2004. The issue was fixed in J2SE 1.4.2\_07. Sun’s advisory can be found at

<http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-57740-1>

The advisory also contains workarounds for the problem.

# Sun Java: Web Start argument injection vulnerability — GLSA **200503-28**

Java Web Start JNLP files can be abused to evade sandbox restriction and
execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/sun-jdk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.2.07** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.2.07**< **1.4.2** |

| Package | **dev-java/sun-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.2.07** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.2.07**< **1.4.2** |

### Background

Sun provides implementations of Java Development Kits (JDK) and Java
Runtime Environments (JRE). These implementations provide the Java Web
Start technology that can be used for easy client-side deployment of
Java applications.

### Description

Jouko Pynnonen discovered that Java Web Start contains a vulnerability
in the way it handles property tags in JNLP files.

### Impact

By enticing a user to open a malicious JNLP file, a remote attacker
could pass command line arguments to the Java Virtual machine, which
can be used to bypass the Java "sandbox" and to execute arbitrary code
with the permissions of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sun JDK users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.4.2.07"
```

All Sun JRE users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.4.2.07"
```
