Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-0836:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Java Web Start handles Java system properties defined within JNLP (Java Network Launching Protocol) files. Specifically, it fails to properly quote property values when passing them as command-line arguments to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** Malicious users can inject arbitrary command-line arguments into the `javaw.exe` (Java Web Start executable) process by exploiting the lack of proper quoting of system property values.
- **Sandbox Bypass:** By injecting specific command-line arguments, attackers can override the default Java security policies. This can allow an untrusted Java application to escape its sandbox.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Web Start does not sanitize or validate the values of system properties extracted from JNLP files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By bypassing the sandbox, attackers can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the user's permissions.
- **System Compromise:** This can lead to a full system compromise, potentially enabling attackers to read/write files, install malware (viruses, keyloggers), and other malicious activities.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially use the compromised system to steal sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Browser Exploitation:**
    - An attacker can host a malicious JNLP file on a web server. By enticing a user to visit the web page (e.g., via an `IFRAME` tag), the JNLP file can be automatically launched, triggering the vulnerability.
    - This is especially dangerous with browsers like Internet Explorer which tend to open JNLP files automatically. Other browsers might prompt the user but can also be configured to automatically launch JNLP files.
- **Malicious JNLP File Replacement:** An attacker can replace a legitimate JNLP file on a web site with a malicious one, causing it to be launched on unsuspecting users.
- **Local Exploitation:** Since Web Start applications can be launched from desktop shortcuts, the Web Start menu or command line, these methods are also vulnerable if the attacker manages to replace the JNLP files used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Code Hosting:** The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious JNLP file on a publicly accessible web server.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker typically needs to entice users to visit their malicious page or otherwise launch their JNLP files.
- **Knowledge of Java Web Start:** Attackers must understand how Java Web Start works, the structure of JNLP files, and how to exploit the vulnerability to bypass the sandbox.
