Package: sharutils
Version: 1:4.2.1-11
Severity: grave
Tags: security

In unshar.c:

      sprintf (name_buffer, "/tmp/unsh.%05d", (int) getpid ());
      unlink (name_buffer);

      if (file = fopen (name_buffer, "w+"), !file)

The unlink makes it difficult, but surely not impossible to race unshar,
when it is run on stdin, and cause it to fopen a symlink that points at
an arbitrary file, which will then be replaced with the contents of the
shell archive.

A few other unsafe (but not IMHO really serious) uses of /tmp in sharutils
include:

- This example in shar(1):

              find . -type f -print | sort | shar -S -Z -L50 -o /tmp/big

- This example in the info file:

          find . -type f -print | shar -S -o /tmp/big.shar

- This example in README.OLD:

e.g., find . -type f -print | sort | shar -C -l50 -o /tmp/big

- This in contrib/shar.sh:

        echo 'temp=/tmp/shar$$; dtemp=/tmp/.shar$$'
        echo 'trap "rm -f $temp $dtemp; exit" 0 1 2 3 15'
        echo 'cat > $temp <<\!!!'

        echo "wc $contents | sed 's=[^ ]*/==' | "'diff -b $temp - >$dtemp'

Wrong assumption.  It was announced on info-gnu.  These new
issues will get faster action with a suggested patch :-).

Since sharutils is still barely on life support, perhaps it is not
quite yet in the grave....;)

Hello.

I received this from the Debian bug system:

I see that there is a 4.3.78 release in ftp.gnu.org, but as it's in
a separate directory, I assume it is not considered stable yet.

May I suggest that sharutils 4.3.77 and 4.3.78 are not put in directories
named "4.3.77" and "REL-4.3.78", then? The current layout is a little
bit misleading.

Ok, here is a patch that maybe you can accept:

       if (file = fopen (name_buffer, "w+"), !file)
 	error (EXIT_FAILURE, errno, name_buffer);
-#ifndef __MSDOS__

 #endif

       while (size_read = fread (copy_buffer, 1, sizeof (copy_buffer), stdin),

This patch tries not to break the MSDOS stuff. For Unix, there is no
need to unlink the file (the tmpfile function already does this), not
to mention we don't even know the name of the file, so we have to
change the error message a little bit to not reference name_buffer,
since it does not have any useful value.

```

The first was a typo that I didn't notice until my script was already running.
It is my intention to release in REL-xxxxx subdirectories.  It reduces clutter.

Ok. For completeness, I'm also going to change /tmp/foo to /somewhere/foo
in both the manpage and the texinfo file, since those are included in
the Debian binary package. Please remember to rewrite README.OLD and
contrib/shar.sh appropriately for release 4.3.79.

Thanks.
