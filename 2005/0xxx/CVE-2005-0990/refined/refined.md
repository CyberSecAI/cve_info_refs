    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-0990",
      "content_type": "debian bug report",
      "vulnerability_description": "The `unshar` utility in sharutils creates temporary files in /tmp using predictable names based on process ID. It unlinks the file after creating the filename, but before actually opening the file using `fopen`. This creates a race condition, where an attacker could create a symlink with the same name in between the unlink and the fopen. When the vulnerable code opens the file, it will open the symlink, and overwrite the pointed file with content from the shell archive.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a temporary file race condition in the `unshar` utility.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure temporary file creation",
        "Race condition"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can overwrite an arbitrary file with the contents of a shell archive. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or other system compromise depending on the targeted file.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to run unshar and also be able to create files in /tmp.",
         "The `unshar` utility must be run on stdin to trigger the vulnerable code.",
         "The attacker has to win a race condition, by creating a symlink after unshar unlinks the temporary file."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to run the `unshar` utility, and have the ability to create files and symlinks in `/tmp`."
