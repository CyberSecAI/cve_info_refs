Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2005-0644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the McAfee Scan Engine when processing malformed LHA files. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when handling "type 2" headers within LHA files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, where the software attempts to write beyond the allocated memory buffer when parsing a specially crafted LHA file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- Complete System Compromise:  The attacker-supplied code would run with Local System privileges, resulting in a complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious LHA file: The attack vector involves crafting a malformed LHA file.
- Delivery methods:  The malicious file can be introduced to a vulnerable system via various means such as:
    - Web servers
    - FTP servers
    - Email messages
    - File servers

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft malformed LHA files: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted LHA file that exploits the buffer overflow.
- Remote access: The attacker needs to find a way to deliver the malicious LHA file to the vulnerable system, but direct access to the machine is not needed.
