 Vulnerable: PBLang 4.63 (and earlier?)

 ---

 General information:

 PBLang is an international BBS-software based on
PHP. It does not require any database but bases on a
flatfile system. Many professional features. More
info on the project website.

 ---

 Description:

 This is bad. sendpm.php contains a flaw that allows
a registered (and logged in) user to view other users
password hashes, as well as their PM's and other
files on the forum (and outside of the forum
directory even). An attacker can compromise the
target system without any trouble using this.

 ---

 Proof Of Concept:

 <http://localhost/pblang/sendpm.php?to=>[username]&subj=[doesnt
matter]&num=1&orig=/home/public_html/pblang/db/members/[username]
 will load [username]'s entire account information
including the MD5'ed password hash and maybe hidden
email information. It will be shown in webpages
source code, not in the page itself, so right click
and view page source.

 Including /etc/passwd is possible aswell, as is any
file on the server.

 ---

 Fix and Vendor status:

 Vendor has been notified, expect official patch
soon.
