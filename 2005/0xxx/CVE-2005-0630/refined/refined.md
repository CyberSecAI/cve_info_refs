- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sendpm.php` script in PBLang 4.63 allows a registered and logged-in user to specify an arbitrary file path in the `orig` parameter. This path is then used to read and display the contents of the file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability in the `sendpm.php` script. The script does not properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied file path, allowing arbitrary file reads.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files such as user databases containing password hashes, PM's, and potentially system files like `/etc/passwd`. This allows for the compromise of user accounts and potentially the entire system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to the `sendpm.php` script, manipulating the `orig` parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered and logged-in user of the PBLang forum.
