Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2005-0088:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the "publisher" handle of the `mod_python` module. This handle allows objects inside Python modules to be accessed via URLs.
- The flaw is due to missing input sanitization when handling requests for published module pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A lack of proper input validation allows specially crafted URLs to expose internal information about variables, objects, and other data that should not be visible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive internal data of the application.
- This may include variable names, values, object data, and potentially more.
- The leaked information could be used for further attacks or malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via crafted URLs.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves sending specifically crafted HTTP requests to the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the application:** The attacker needs to be aware that the application uses mod_python and utilizes the publisher handle.
- **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to have the capability to generate specific URLs that trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of `mod_python` for both Apache 1.3 and 2.0.
- Several Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Red Hat, and Trustix were affected and released patches.
- A workaround was suggested but not as a definitive solution: blocking URLs containing requests that begin with "func_".
