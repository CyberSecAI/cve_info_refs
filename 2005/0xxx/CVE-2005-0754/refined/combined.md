How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

KDE Security Advisory: Kommander untrusted code execution
Original Release Date: 2005-04-20

0. References

        <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0754>

1. Systems affected:

        Quanta 3.1.x, KDE 3.2 and new up to including KDE 3.4.0.

2. Overview:

        Kommander is a visual editor and interpreter to edit and
        interpret visual dialogs and execute scripts attached to
        dialog actions.

        Kommander executes without user confirmation data files
        from possibly untrusted locations. As they contain
        scripts, the user might accidentally run arbitrary code.

3. Impact:

        Remotly supplied kommander files from untrusted sources
        are executed without confirmation.

4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.

5. Patch:

        A patch for KDE 3.4.0 is available from
        ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches :

        c388b21d91c8326fc9757cd8786713db  post-3.4.0-kdewebdev-kommander.diff
