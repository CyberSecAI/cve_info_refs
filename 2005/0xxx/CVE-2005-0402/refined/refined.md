          "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because Firefox did not properly perform security checks when loading content in the sidebar from a bookmark. Specifically, links to privileged content (such as about:config) were not blocked, allowing malicious code to be executed.",

          "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into bookmarking a malicious page as a sidebar panel, and then opening a privileged page in that sidebar, injecting JavaScript code and modifying configurations or deleting files.",

             "User interaction (bookmarking a malicious page)",

The attacker also needs to be able to modify the malicious page so that it attempts to load privileged URLs. Once the user loads the malicious sidebar panel and clicks on the injected malicious links, the code is executed."
