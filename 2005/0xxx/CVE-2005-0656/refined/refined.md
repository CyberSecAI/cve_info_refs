Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Aura CMS as described in the second document.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A. Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in the `id` and `topik` parameters within the `teman.php`, `hal.php`, and `arsip.php` files. Specifically, the application does not sanitize these parameters before using them in a database query.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.  By injecting characters like "`" and "select all", attackers can cause the MySQL queries to fail, resulting in error messages that reveal the full server paths to the PHP files.
    *   **Impact:**  Reveals the server's directory structure, which can aid in further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP GET requests with malicious SQL statements in `id` and `topik` parameters to `teman.php`, `hal.php` and `arsip.php`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker only needs network access to the web server.

*   **B. Session ID Exposure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Uninitialized variables being used in the application's code, specifically the `$hits` variable in `hits.php` which allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code.
    *   **Weakness:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability and insecure session management. The application doesn't properly sanitize user input when used in a counter module.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can steal session IDs through Javascript injection, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP GET requests containing malicious JavaScript in the `hits` parameter of `hits.php`, the `query` parameter of `index.php`, and `theCount` parameter of `counter.php`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker only needs network access to the web server.

**Summary of Findings:**

The Aura CMS version 1.5 is vulnerable to SQL injection leading to full path disclosure and XSS vulnerabilities that can be used to steal session IDs. The identified vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers with only network access to the web server by sending crafted HTTP requests, posing a high risk of information disclosure and session hijacking.
