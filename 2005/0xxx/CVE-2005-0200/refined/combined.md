# [January Security Alert](article102-January-Security-Alert)

 Damian Parker - 16 Jan 2005 08:51 GMT-0000

 [![Security](article_image.php?image_type=topic&id=4)](tiki-view_articles.php?topic=4 "List all articles of the same topic (Security)")

It has been brought to the security team's attention that yet more problems exist in TikiWiki; these are similar to the Christmas Alert, but affect a different directory. Everyone is required to read and take corrective action. If you do not take action you could lose your entire server!

This is a copy of the email sent to tiki-users and tiki-devel mailing lists.

---------

Greets, this is a high priority, urgent notice that affects all admins regarding all versions of TikiWiki.

We (security[**@tw**](user4377 "User Information")) have been informed of several flaws which allow the execution of .php code from the $tikiroot/temp/ folder. This is being used in conjunction with a php script that basically gives the "attacker" ssh like control of the server and run do anything as the apache user. It is very similar to that describe in tikiwiki.org/art97

We already know that this has killed one server, resulting in it requiring a complete re-format and re-install. Dont let it be yours!

Please check your temp/ folder for any suspicious files and delete them, if you want to send samples, please forward them to security @ tw.o (tw.o is tikiwiki.org ðŸ˜‰ ) We know these files have been called lol.php, gif.php, phpshell.php, shell.php

This affects all TikiWiki releases;

* If your using 1.8.x you can [grab the latest tarball from de.tikiwiki.org](http://de.tikiwiki.org/tar/lastiki_BRANCH-1-8.tar.bz2 "External link"), or cvs update to BRANCH-1-8
* If your using any version of 1.9, you must upgrade to CVS BRANCH-1-9 or again, [download the tarball from de.tikiwiki.org](http://de.tikiwiki.org/tar/lastiki_BRANCH-1-9.tar.bz2 "External link")
* If your on 1.7.X upgrade to 1.8

And also add a .htaccess or block via Apache Virtual Host the temp/ in the same way as described in tikiwiki.org/art97

Official SourceForge based releases of 1.8.5 and 1.9 DR4 will be released as soon as possible.

As always we are living in IRC at irc.tikiwiki.org / #tikiwiki you can see [ConnectingToIRC](Connecting-To-IRC "How to connect to #tikiwiki chat room on irc.freenode.net") for connection details everyone is welcome.

## Please protect your Tiki, and please pass on the word to anyone you know with a Tiki.Â !!

Expect more updates as the weekend progresses, we are running a full review of the code, when the final releases are made, please again upgrade to those releases or cvs update again.

[Damian Parker](Damian "Some links from me")

---------

So to summarise:

* Upgrade to the latest tarball or CVS BRANCH-1-8/BRANCH-1-9 straight away without delay
* In your Apache virtual host entry you will **also** require in addition to those in <art97> :

  Copy to clipboard
  ```
  &lt;Directory "/path/to/tiki/directory/temp"&gt;
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny From All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
  ```
* or a .htaccess in temp/

**Please pass on the word to ANYONE with a TikiWiki, this is very serious issue, and all TikiWikis are open to the flaw.**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Jean-FranÃ§ois Brunette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-21 06:02:13 UTC  ``` similar to the previous one (<http://tikiwiki.org/art97>)   Description: Some vulnerabilities have been reported in TikiWiki, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.  The vulnerabilities are caused due to missing validation of files placed in the "temp" directory and can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP scripts.   The vulnerabilities have been reported in versions prior to 1.8.5 and 1.9 DR4.  Solution: Update to version 1.8.5. <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64258>  Deny access to the "temp" directory. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-21 06:32:22 UTC  ``` Nasty, indeed. web-apps, bumping is necessary. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Martin Holzer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-28 14:54:48 UTC  ``` ebuild in cvs ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-28 22:50:54 UTC  ``` Thx Martin.  ppc please test and mark stable. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Michael Hanselmann (hansmi) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-29 02:47:23 UTC  ``` Stable on ppc. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-30 00:42:48 UTC  ``` GLSA 200501-41 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Michael Davey    2005-04-03 06:19:46 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 79077](show_bug.cgi?id=79077 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - tikiwiki 1.8.5 released") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` |  |
