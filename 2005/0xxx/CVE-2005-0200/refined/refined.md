Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2005-0200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of files uploaded to the `$tikiroot/temp/` directory in TikiWiki. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts, without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary weakness is the absence of validation or sanitization of files uploaded to the `temp/` directory.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading and executing a malicious PHP script, an attacker can gain control of the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver user (typically the apache user).
- **Server Compromise:** The document explicitly states "you could lose your entire server!", meaning the attacker can gain full control, potentially leading to data loss, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Complete Re-installation:** In a real-world case, a server had to be completely reformatted and re-installed due to this vulnerability being exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious PHP script to the `/temp/` directory.
- **Direct Execution:** The attacker then directly executes the uploaded script through a web request (likely by accessing it through its URL).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Web Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the TikiWiki instance over the network to perform the upload and subsequent execution.
- **No Authentication Required:** There is no mention of any required authentication for this vulnerability, suggesting that it may be exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** All versions of TikiWiki prior to 1.8.5 and 1.9 DR4 are affected.
- **Similar to Previous Issue:** The issue is similar to a previous security alert (mentioned as tikiwiki.org/art97), but affects the `/temp/` directory instead of another.
- **Mitigation:** The recommended actions are:
  - Upgrading to the latest versions (1.8.5 or higher, 1.9 DR4 or higher).
  - Denying access to the `/temp/` directory via Apache configuration (Directory directive) or `.htaccess` file.

The information in the provided documents expands on the brief CVE description by detailing the attack vector (upload of a malicious PHP script), specific directory (`/temp/`), and the severity (arbitrary command execution leading to server compromise).
