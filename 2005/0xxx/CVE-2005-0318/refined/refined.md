The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Alt-N WebAdmin <= 3.0.2, but does not specifically relate to CVE-2005-0318, which is a placeholder.

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper input sanitization in the `useredit_account.wdm` file.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not prevent the injection of malicious scripts in the `user` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL containing a script in the `user` parameter of the `useredit_account.wdm` page.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can trick a user into clicking a crafted link.

2.  **User Account Manipulation**
    *   **Root Cause:** Missing authorization checks in the `useredit_account.wdm` script.
    *   **Weakness:**  The application fails to restrict users from editing other user accounts through the `user` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker with valid WebAdmin credentials can modify settings of other user accounts. However, the attacker can only modify settings that the user themselves can modify in their own account.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a URL to the `useredit_account.wdm` page with a target user's username in the `user` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs valid access to WebAdmin, they must also be able to modify a field on their account to modify it on other user's accounts.

3.  **HTML Injection**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The `modalfram.wdm` file allows loading arbitrary web pages.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not validate the `file` parameter, allowing loading of external web pages.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can make an external web page appear as part of WebAdmin, potentially facilitating phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a URL to the `modalfram.wdm` page with a malicious external URL in the `file` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can trick a user into clicking a crafted link.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vendor was notified on December 14, 2004, and released a patch on the same day.
*   The report explicitly states that these vulnerabilities do not enable an attacker to gain any privileges on an affected computer, and user account manipulation is limited by the attacker's permissions.
