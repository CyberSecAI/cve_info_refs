Response:

```
Root cause of vulnerability: Inconsistent processing of HTTP request headers by interconnected devices, specifically related to multiple Content-length headers and carriage return-line feed (CRLF) pairs.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Inconsistent parsing of HTTP headers by web servers, caches, and proxy servers.
    - Lack of strict validation of Content-Length headers.
    - Vulnerability to CRLF injection.
Impact of exploitation:
    - Remote attacker can inject malicious content into web or browser caches.
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks become possible.
    - Hijacking of user and session data.
    - Bypassing content protection mechanisms.
    - Web Cache Poisoning.
    - Browser Cache Poisoning.
    - Cross-User Attacks.
    - Page Hijacking.
Attack vectors:
    - Sending crafted HTTP requests with multiple Content-length headers and embedded CRLF sequences.
Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
    - Ability to send HTTP requests to vulnerable systems.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability is platform independent.
- The content mentions Squid and Lotus Domino as affected products and provides links to patches or fixes.
- HTTP Response Splitting is outlined in depth in the Watchfire HTTP Response Splitting whitepaper
