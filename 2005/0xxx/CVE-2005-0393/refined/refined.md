- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure usage of temporary files by helper scripts within the `crip` package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application uses temporary files in an insecure way, potentially allowing other local users to access or manipulate these files.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Local users could potentially gain unauthorized access to data processed by `crip` or manipulate the program's behavior by interfering with the temporary files.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is local; a malicious actor would need to have a user account on the same system as the user running the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a local user on the system where crip is being used.
