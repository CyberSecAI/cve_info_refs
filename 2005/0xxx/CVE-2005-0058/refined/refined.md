Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-0058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) service validates data and permissions, specifically related to message length before passing it to an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the TAPI service. By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can overwrite the buffer, leading to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** On systems not configured as telephony servers, the vulnerability can be used to gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** On Windows 2000 Servers configured as telephony servers, anonymous users can remotely exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious message over the network using RPC. On Windows Server 2003 servers configured as telephony servers, only authenticated users can perform the same remote attack.
*   **Local:** On Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP systems, an attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** For remote exploitation on Windows 2000 Servers (configured as telephony servers), an attacker only needs network connectivity to the targeted system and the ability to send a malformed TAPI message. On Windows Server 2003 systems configured as telephony servers, an attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the targeted system.
*   **Local:** For local privilege escalation, an attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and the ability to execute code on the target system, but does not need specific permissions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Telephony service is not running by default on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, but the TAPI client can start the service without user interaction.
*   Disabling the Telephony service is provided as a workaround.
*   Firewall rules are suggested to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   The advisory mentions that Windows 98, 98 SE, and ME are not critically affected, although they contain the vulnerable component.
*   Microsoft recommends applying the provided patches as soon as possible.
*   The Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-040 provides a comprehensive breakdown of the vulnerability, affected systems, mitigation strategies, and file information for the patches.
