How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately-reported vulnerability. A vulnerability exits in the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) service that could allow remote code execution. The vulnerability is documented in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 98, 98 SE, ME | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |

* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**How does the extended support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition affect the release of security updates for these operating systems?**

Microsoft will only release security updates for critical security issues. Non-critical security issues are not offered during this support period. For more information about the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policies for these operating systems, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33327).

For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities that are addressed in this security bulletin?**

No. Although Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition do contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 ended on June 30, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a ended on December 31, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 have reached the end of their life cycles. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT 4.0 SP6a must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Security update support for Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) ended on June 30, 2005.Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

With the release of Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) will no longer receive security update support. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Telephony Service Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0058

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Telephony Service Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0058:

* Remote code execution is possible if you have manually enabled the telephony server feature. The telephony server feature is only available on Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003. For information about this feature, visit the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/serverhelp/a3574189-fd2f-4e12-90d9-c3ecb65a8226.mspx).
* On Windows Server 2003 the Telephony service is restricted to authenticated user accounts, even when enabled as a telephony server. Anonymous attacks are not possible on Windows Server 2003.
* On Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 based systems that have not manually configured the telephony server feature, this is a local elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
* On Windows 2000 Professional and on Windows XP, this is a local elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
* By default, the Telephony service is not running on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. However, the TAPI client will start the Telephony service without user interaction when required. Unless the Telephony service has been set to **Disabled** by an administrator, a non-privileged user account can start this service. Systems that have disabled the Telephony service would not be vulnerable to this issue.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for Telephony Service Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0058:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable the Telephony service.**

  Disabling the Telephony service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Telephony service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel.** Alternatively, Click **Start**, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Telephony**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.

     You can also stop and disable the Telephony service by using the following command at the command prompt:

  `sc stop tapisrv & sc config tapisrv start= disabled`

**Impact of Workaround:** If the Telephony service is disabled, any dependant services or operating system features would fail. Examples of these features include the new connection wizard, RAS, modem based dial-up networking, and the fax service, would fail. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot apply the security update.

* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593**
  + **All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024**
  + **Any other specifically configured RPC port**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with RPC. RPC can be used to remotely communicate with the Telephony service on Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports that RPC uses, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

```
1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
2.  In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

```

To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

   **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.

* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPsec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPsec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).
