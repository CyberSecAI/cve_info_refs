- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The PostNuke Download module does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding new downloads. Specifically, the 'Program name', 'File link', 'Author s name', 'Author s e-mail address', 'File size', 'Version', and 'Home page' fields are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Download module of PostNuke.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the download fields. When an administrator views the new downloads, this malicious code executes within the administrator's browser. This can allow the attacker to steal the admin's session cookies or modify the site's content.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the `modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=AddDownload` URL. An attacker submits a crafted form using this URL, including malicious JavaScript code in vulnerable parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the 'AddDownload' form in the Downloads module. The attacker does not need to be an administrator. The malicious script will execute on the administrator's browser after the admin logs in and views the added download.
