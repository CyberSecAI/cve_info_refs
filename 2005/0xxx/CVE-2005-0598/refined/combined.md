## Cisco ACNS RealServer RealSubscruber vulnerable to DoS via malformed IP packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#579240

Original Release Date: 2005-03-10 | Last Revised: 2005-03-10

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in Cisco ACNS RealServer RealSubscriber may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service on an affected device via malformed IP packets.

### Description

| Cisco Application and Content Networking System ([ACNS](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/conntsw/ps491/)) is an integrated caching and content-delivery platform. ACNS 5.1 includes RealServer as an optional component. [RealSubscriber](http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/webscale/uce/acns51/deploy51/51stream.htm#wp1039106) is RealServer configured for subscriber-only mode. RealSubscriber is disabled by default. Specially crafted packets may cause RealSubscriber to consume 100% of the CPU of an affected device. A reboot of the device is required to recover. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause a denial-of-service condition on an affected system. |
| --- |
