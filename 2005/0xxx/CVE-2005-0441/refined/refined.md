Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2005-0441.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities present in Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) and a denial-of-service vulnerability in the xp_server component. Specifically, the buffer overflows occur in the following areas:
*   `attrib_valid` function.
*   `convert` function.
*   `declare` statement for data types.
*   Abstract query plan syntax.
*   `install java` statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Multiple Stack Buffer Overflows:**  Five stack buffer overflows exist within Sybase ASE's parsing and built-in functions, and the `install java` command.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The `xp_server` component is vulnerable to a crash due to the submission of garbage data to its TCP port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflows can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Sybase database server process. This can lead to complete control over the data managed by the Sybase server.
*   **Data Manipulation/Access:** Attackers can potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service:** The DoS vulnerability can cause the `xp_server` process to crash, disrupting the functionality of Sybase ASE.
*  **SQL Injection Risk:** The buffer overflows can be triggered via SQL injection attacks, potentially allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute code.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Authenticated Database Users:** The primary attack vector for the buffer overflows is through authenticated database users executing malicious queries or commands.
*   **SQL Injection:** These vulnerabilities can be exploited using SQL injection attacks by an attacker who does not know the database credentials.
*   **Unauthenticated Network Connection (for DoS):** The DoS vulnerability in the `xp_server` is exploitable through an unauthenticated remote network connection sending garbage data to the specified TCP port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **For Buffer Overflows (excluding install java):** A valid username and password for the Sybase server are required, or ability to perform a SQL injection.
*   **For "install java" Overflow:** The attacker must be a database owner (dbo) or have the "sa" role.
*  **For the xp_server DoS:** No authentication is required, and the attacker needs the ability to send data to an open port on the server.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory emphasizes the danger posed by the buffer overflows due to their location in parsing components and built-in functions accessible to all authenticated users.
*   The advisory highlights the potential for SQL injection to escalate the impact, as it could allow unauthenticated attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   It also mentions that the Sybase server may run under administrative privileges on some systems, increasing the severity of code execution.
*   Workarounds include running Sybase with low privileges, using a firewall, restricting user accounts, enforcing password policies, auditing and using IDS/IPS.
