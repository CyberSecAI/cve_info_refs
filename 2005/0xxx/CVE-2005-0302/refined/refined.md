Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Comersus ASP Shopping Cart:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Administrator Login Bypass:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The file `comersus_backoffice_install10.asp` sets the session variable `admin` to 1, granting administrator privileges, without requiring prior authentication or administrator access. This file is accessible to anyone, even after installation.
    *   **Weakness:**  Insecure session management, lack of proper access controls during setup.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gain full administrative access to the shopping cart software, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL commands, decrypt passwords, and access other sensitive functions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the `comersus_backoffice_install10.asp` file via a web request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker only needs to be able to send a web request to the vulnerable script.

2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `default.asp` script uses the `HTTP_Referer` server variable without sanitizing it before embedding it in an SQL query. The `pReferrer` variable, taken from the referrer header is directly inserted into the SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation, improper construction of SQL queries.
    *  **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, allowing data manipulation, information disclosure, or other database attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to `default.asp` with SQL code in the `Referer` header.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to craft and send HTTP requests.

3.  **Design Flaw (Password Encryption):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Encryption keys are stored within the same database as the encrypted passwords.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure storage of encryption keys.
    *  **Impact:** If an attacker obtains database access (e.g. via SQL injection or access to database backups), they can retrieve the key to decrypt passwords.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Requires database access (e.g., achieved through SQL injection).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to access the database.

4.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `comersus_supportError.asp` and `comersus_backofficelite_supportError.asp` scripts do not properly sanitize user-provided input in the `error` parameter.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding, allowing JavaScript injection.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the error page, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or other client-side attacks.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request with malicious JavaScript in the error parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to craft and send HTTP requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vendor released a patch (version 6.0.2) to address these vulnerabilities and is commended for their swift response.
*   The advisory is available at: <http://www.comersus.org/forum/displayMessage.asp?mid=32753>
