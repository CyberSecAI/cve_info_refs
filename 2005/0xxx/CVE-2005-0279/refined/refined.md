Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in SÖLDNER - Secret Wars, as reported by Luigi Auriemma, which match the description of CVE-2005-0279:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A] Silent Socket Termination:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The server's UDP socket handling has a flaw where receiving a packet of 1401 bytes or more triggers a "message too long" error. This error is not handled gracefully, causing the listening thread to terminate silently without any warning or messages to the administrator.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper error handling in socket communication.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service. The server becomes unavailable without clear indication of the cause.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted UDP packet of 1401 or more bytes to the server.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Remote attacker.

*   **B] In-Game Format String:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The game server improperly handles user-supplied input, allowing format string specifiers (e.g., `%n%n%n`).
    *   **Weakness:**  Format string vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Server crash or potentially remote code execution on the game server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a message containing format string specifiers through the game's chat or other input mechanism.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** In-game attacker.

*   **C] In-Game Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vs Admin:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The server's web interface (port 7890) displays server logs, including user chat messages, without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:**  Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in the administrator's browser.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending messages containing malicious HTML/JavaScript code through the game's chat, which is then displayed in the admin web interface.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** In-game attacker.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerabilities are present in SÖLDNER - Secret Wars versions <= 30830.
*   The report indicates no fix was available at the time, and the developers did not respond to the initial report.
*   The severity of these vulnerabilities is high, especially concerning remote code execution and denial of service.
