How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## IPsec configurations may be vulnerable to information disclosure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#302220

Original Release Date: 2005-05-09 | Last Revised: 2005-07-06

---

### Overview

The IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol used in tunneling mode may be vulnerable to multiple attacks when confidentiality mode is used without integrity protection, or in certain cases where integrity protection is provided by higher-level protocols.

### Description

| The [IP Security (IPsec) protocol suite](http://www.ietf.org/ids.by.wg/ipsec.html) are IETF standards commonly used to provide secure networking facilities at the Internet Protocol level such as the establishment of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  Within the IPsec suite, the [Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipsec-esp-v3-10.txt) protocol provides confidentiality for packets by applying encryption algorithms, along with several other services. The [Authentication Header (AH)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2402.txt) protocol can be used to complement the ESP functionality with integrity protection. Both the ESP and AH protocols can be used in either "Transport" or "Tunneling" mode. When [Cipher Block Chaining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_Block_Chaining) (CBC) encryption, which has a well-known set of flaws allowing bit-flipping attacks, is used by ESP in tunneling mode to provide confidentiality guarantees without proper integrity protection for inner (tunneled) packets, attackers may be able to perform the following attacks:Destination Address Rewriting: The destination IP address of the inner, encrypted packet is modified in a bit-flipping attack. Intermediate gateways may then route the inner packet to the modified destination address once the inner packet is recovered.IP Options modification: The header length and source address of the inner packet is modified by performing a bit-flipping attack on the outer payload. Once the modified inner packet is recovered, the structure of the packet may be affected in such a manner that an [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc792.html) Parameter Problem message is generated and sent to the source address of the inner packet along with the plaintext payload. This may be intercepted, leading to a recovery of the original inner packet plaintext payload.Protocol Field modification: In a similar manner to the IP Options modification attack, the protocol field and source address of the inner packet are modified in a bit-flipping attack against the outer packet payload. An invalid or unusable value in the protocol field may then cause a system which is processing a recovered inner packet to generate an ICMP Protocol Unreachable message. This ICMP message is then sent back to the (modified) source address with the plaintext payload of the inner packet, which may be intercepted in order to recover the plaintext.These attacks involve an amount of probabilistic success, but any successful attacks disclose information which makes future attacks more efficient. This may allow for automated plaintext recovery with a minimal amount of effort. The underlying problem is the use of CBC mode encryption used for confidentiality, which is susceptible to known attacks that allow the encrypted data to be modified in a known manner. If integrity protection is not applied in a proper fashion to this encrypted data, the change may be undetected and accepted as authentic packet(s). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker that is able to intercept and modify IPsec (and ICMP, for some scenarios) communications between security gateways may be able to recover plaintext of the IPsec communications between them. |
| --- |

### Solution

| For vendor-specific solutions, please see your vendor's information regarding this issue. |
| --- |

| Suggested workarounds include- configuring ESP to use both confidentiality and integrity protection. This is the recommended workaround.- using the Authentication Header (AH) protocol to provide integrity protection along with ESP in a manner which is not vulnerable.- restricting ICMP error reporting with network filters or firewalls. |

### [Cisco Systems Inc.](#KMIS-6CAMPS) Affected

Notified:  May 09, 2005  Updated: May 17, 2005

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Cisco is vulnerable to the attacks described against IPSec in tunnel mode without authentication configured.

Configuring authentication in addition to confidentiality on IPSec tunnels will prohibit the attack, and has been a recommended Cisco best practice.

### [IBM](#KMIS-6C9LMT) Not Affected

Notified:  May 09, 2005  Updated: May 10, 2005

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

The AIX Operating System is not vulnerable to the issues described in NISCC advisory 004033 or CERT Vulnerability Note VU#302220.

IBM recommends that IPSec be configured with AH support. IPSec will be configured with AH support if it is configured via SMIT or WebSM. It is possible to configure IPSec without AH support using the gentun command. However, even if IPSec is configured without AH support, AIX is not affected by the vulnerabilities described by NISCC advisory 004033. Future versions of the gentun command will remove the possibility for system administrators to configure IPSec without AH support.

NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 004033/NISCC/IPSEC

Vulnerability Issues with IPsec Configurations

Version Information
- - -------------------
Advisory Reference  004033/NISCC/IPSEC
Release Date	    9 May 2005
Last Revision	    9 May 2005
Version Number	    1.0

What is affected?
- - -----------------
Potentially any configuration of IPsec that uses Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) \
in tunnel  mode with confidentiality only, or with integrity protection being \
provided by a higher layer  protocol. Some configurations using AH to provide \
integrity protection are also vulnerable.

Impact
- - ------
If exploited, it is possible for an active attacker to obtain the plaintext version \
of the IPsec- protected communications using only moderate effort.

Severity
- - --------
This is rated as high.

Summary
- - -------
IP Security (IPsec) is a set of protocols developed by the Internet Engineering Task \
Force (IETF)  to support secure exchange of packets at the IP layer; IPsec has been \
deployed widely to implement  Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

Three attacks that apply to certain configurations of IPsec have been identified. \
These  configurations use Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) in tunnel mode with \
confidentiality only,  or with integrity protection being provided by a higher layer \
protocol. Some configurations using  AH to provide integrity protection are also \
vulnerable. In these configurations, an attacker can  modify sections of the IPsec \
packet, causing either the cleartext inner packet to be redirected or  a network host \
to generate an error message. In the latter case, these errors are relayed via the  \
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP); because of the design of ICMP, these \
messages directly  reveal segments of the header and payload of the inner datagram in \
cleartext. An attacker who can  intercept the ICMP messages can then retrieve \
plaintext data. The attacks have been implemented and

demonstrated to work under realistic conditions.

[Please note that revisions to this advisory will not be notified by email. All
subscribers are advised to regularly check the UNIRAS website for updates to this \
notice.]

Details
- - -------
CVE number: CAN-2005-0039

IPsec consists of several separate protocols; these include:

    * Authentication Header (AH): provides authenticity guarantees for packets, by \
attaching strong

      cryptographic checksum to packets.

    * Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): provides confidentiality guarantees for \
                packets, by
      encrypting packets with encryption algorithms. ESP also provides optional \
authentication  services
      for packets.

    * Internet Key Exchange (IKE): provide ways to securely negotiate shared keys.

AH and ESP has two modes of use: transport mode and tunnel mode. With ESP in tunnel \
mode, an IP  packet (called the inner packet) is encrypted in its entirety and is \
used to form the payload of  a new packet (called the outer packet); ESP typically \
uses CBC-mode encryption to provide  confidentiality. However, without some form of \
integrity protection, CBC-mode encrypted  data is vulnerable to modification by an \
active attacker.

By making careful modifications to selected portions of the payload of the outer \
packet, an  attacker can effect controlled changes to the header of the inner \
(encrypted) packet. The modified  inner packet is subsequently processed by the IP \
software on the receiving security gateway or the  endpoint host; the inner packet, \
in cleartext form, may be redirected or certain error messages  may be produced and \
communicated by ICMP. Because of the design of ICMP, these messages directly reveal \
cleartext segments of the header and payload of the inner packet. If these messages \
can be  intercepted by an attacker, then plaintext data is revealed.

Attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities rely on the following:

    * Exploitation of the well-known bit flipping weakness of CBC mode encryption.

    * Lack of integrity protection for inner packets.

    * Interaction between IPsec processing and IP processing on security gateways and \
end hosts.

These attacks can be fully automated so as to recover the entire contents of multiple \
 IPsec-protected inner packets.

In more detail, the three identified attacks on ESP in tunnel mode when integrity \
protection is not

present work as follows:

1. Destination Address Rewriting

    * An attacker modifies the destination IP address of the encrypted (inner) packet \
by bit-  flipping in the payload of the outer packet.
    * The security gateway decrypts the outer payload to recover the (modified) inner \
                packet.
    * The gateway then routes the inner packet according to its (modified) \
                destination IP address.
    * If successful, the "plaintext" inner datagram arrives at a host of the \
attacker's choice.

2. IP Options

    * An attacker modifies the header length of the encrypted (inner) packet by \
bit-flipping in the

      payload of the outer packet.
    * The security gateway decrypts the outer payload to recover the (modified) inner \
                packet.
    * The gateway then performs IP options processing on the inner packet because of \
                the modified
      header length, with the first part of the inner payload being interpreted as \
                options bytes.
    * With some probability, options processing will result in the generation of an \
ICMP "parameter

      problem" message.
    * The ICMP message is routed to the now modified source address of the inner \
                packet.
    * An attacker intercepts the ICMP message and retrieves the "plaintext" payload \
of the inner   packet.

3. Protocol Field

    * An attacker modifies the protocol field and source address field of the \
encrypted (inner)   packet by bit-flipping in the payload of the outer packet.
    * The security gateway decrypts the outer payload to recover the (modified) inner \
                packet.
    * The gateway forwards the inner packet to the intended recipient.
    * The intended recipient inspects the protocol field of the inner packet and \
generates an ICMP  "protocol unreachable" message.
    * The ICMP message is routed to the now modified source address of the inner \
                packet.
    * An attacker intercepts the ICMP message and retrieves the "plaintext" payload \
of the inner   packet.

The attacks are probabilistic in nature and may need to be iterated many times in a \
first phase in  order to be successful. Once this first phase is complete, the \
results can be reused to efficiently recover the contents of further inner packets.

Naturally, the attacker must be able to intercept traffic passing between the \
security gateways in  order to mount the attacks. For the second and third attacks to \
be successful, the attacker must be

able intercept the relevant ICMP messages. Variants of these attacks in which the \
destination of  the ICMP messages can be controlled by the attacker are also \
possible.

Solution
- - --------
Any of the following methods can be used to rectify this issue:

1. Configure ESP to use both confidentiality and integrity protection. This is the \
recommended  solution.

2. Use the AH protocol alongside ESP to provide integrity protection. However, this \
                must be done
carefully: for example, the configuration where AH in transport mode is applied \
end-to-end and  tunnelled inside ESP is still vulnerable.

3. Remove the error reporting by restricting the generation of ICMP messages or by \
filtering  these messages at a firewall or security gateway.
