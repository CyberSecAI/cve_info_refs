Advisory: JPEG EXIF information disclosure
RedTeam likes to raise awareness of common Information Disclosure via JPEG
EXIF thumbnail images in common image processing software.
### Details
- Product: Image processing software
- Affected Version: various
- Immune Version: unknown
- OS affected: any
- Security-Risk: Medium
- Remote-Exploit: No
- Advisory-URL: `https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2005-008`
- Advisory-Status: public
- CVE: CAN-2005-0406 (`https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0406`)
### Introduction
Images created by digital cameras and later cropped or otherwise modified by
applications like Adobe Photoshop often contain an unmodified Version of the
Image in the embedded thumbnail image. This can result in information
disclosure.
### More Details
Digital cameras but also other device embed mini versions ("thumbnails") of
the original image in a JPEG image file. Among others one reason is that
while flipping through images on the cameras small display the camera does
not need to decode and scale the full megapixel picture. The standard to save
this thumbnail and other information within a JPEG file is called EXIF. The
EXIF standard states that image processing software should leave EXIF headers
it doesn't understand alone.
This means that if an image from a digital camera is edited, e.g. by making a
face unrecognizable, and than the modified version is published, chances are
that the thumbnail still contains the unmodified version with the
unobstructed face. There might be situations where also disclosure of other
information in the EXIF header, like the date and time the picture was taken
or the model of the camera used, is problematic.
We found that of the JPEG images on the Internet 20 % have a embedded EXIF
Thumbnail and about 2% have a thumbnail which our screening software
considered significantly different from the original image. After human
screening 0.1% can be considered to have thumbnails which are more than just
boring cropping differences.
### Proof of Concept
See `http://blogs.23.nu/disLEXia/stories/5751/` for some example images.
See `http://md.hudora.de/presentations/#hiddendata-21c3` for code to find
"interesting" images automatically.
### Workaround
There is specialized software available for removing EXIF information. Use it.
### Fix
Image processing software should either update or remove the EXIF thumbnail.
### Security Risk
Our research indicates that around 0.001% of all images contain seriously
harmful information in the EXIF thumbnail.
### History
- 2003-07-xx tech.tv moderator incident - private parts in the thumbnail
- 2004-07-xx Maximillian Dornseif gets aware of this incident, discuss it at
Defcon 12
- 2004-10-xx Steven J. Murdoch (The University of Cambridge, Security Group)
creates exif\_thumb to automatically screen image. We learn that the problem
is quite widespread and not a random software glitch.
- 2004-12-28 Dornseif & Murdoch present the results form a large scale survey
of images on the internet at the 21. Chaos Communication Congress
- 2005-02-12 CVE number requested
- 2005-02-14 posted to the public as CAN-2005-0406
- 2009-05-08 Updated Advisory URL
