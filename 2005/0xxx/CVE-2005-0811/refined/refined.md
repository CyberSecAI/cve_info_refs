- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NotifyLink web interface does not properly restrict access to administrative functions. The interface disables buttons for restricted functions, but the underlying URLs for those functions can still be accessed by a normal authenticated user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate access control, specifically the failure to authenticate users for each feature page rather than relying solely on the presentation layer to enforce restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated normal users can access and execute functions that have been disabled by an administrator, potentially leading to unauthorized configuration changes or data access.
- **Attack vectors**: By directly manipulating the URL in the browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user, and they must be able to access the web interface.
