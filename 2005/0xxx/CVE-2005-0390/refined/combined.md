How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 706-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
April 13th, 2005                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : axel
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0390
BugTraq ID     : 13059

Ulf Härnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a
buffer overflow in axel, a light download accellerator.  When reading
remote input the program did not check if a part of the input can
overflow a buffer and maybe trigger the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0a-1woody1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0b-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your axel package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Axel: Vulnerability in HTTP redirection handling — GLSA **200504-09**

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in Axel which could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/axel** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0b** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0b** |

### Background

Axel is a console-based FTP/HTTP download accelerator.

### Description

A possible buffer overflow has been reported in the HTTP
redirection handling code in conn.c.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting up a
malicious site and enticing a user to connect to it. This could
possibly lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions
of the user running Axel.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Axel users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/axel-1.0b"
```
