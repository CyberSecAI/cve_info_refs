Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the HTTP redirection handling code within the `conn.c` file of the Axel download accelerator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The program does not properly validate the size of input when handling HTTP redirections, allowing a malicious server to send an overly long redirection URL that overwrites a buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running Axel.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** An attacker could set up a malicious HTTP server that sends a crafted redirect response with an excessively long URL.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must use the vulnerable Axel application to connect to the malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to control a web server that can be accessed by a user running a vulnerable version of Axel.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTTP redirect response.

**Summary of Information from Different Sources:**

*   **Debian Security Advisory (DSA 706-1):** Confirms the buffer overflow and its potential for arbitrary code execution, states that the vulnerability is not specific to Debian, and provides patched versions for both stable (woody) and unstable (sid) distributions. It also includes links to updated package files.
*   **Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200504-09):** Provides similar information, stating that the vulnerability resides in the HTTP redirection handling within `conn.c`.  It also describes the attack vector, impact, and provides instructions on how to upgrade the package.
*   **Debian changelog:** Documents the fix of the buffer overflow in HTTP redirection handling in `conn.c` as part of the new release.
