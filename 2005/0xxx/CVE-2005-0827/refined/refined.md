```
- Root cause of vulnerability: An error in the `convertorderbytrans` function within `viewcat.php` of RUNCMS leads to a SQL error when supplied with an invalid address.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Path disclosure vulnerability due to the error message revealing the installation path of RUNCMS.
- Impact of exploitation: The attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure by observing the disclosed installation path.
- Attack vectors: By accessing the MyDownloads or MyLinks module in RUNCMS and selecting a category. Then manipulating the `convertorderbytrans` function within the `viewcat.php` file by providing an incorrect address, leading to an error that exposes the installation path.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have access to the RUNCMS application, navigate to the MyDownloads or MyLinks module, and interact with the category selection feature.
