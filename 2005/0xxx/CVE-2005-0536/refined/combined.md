# MediaWiki: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200502-33**

MediaWiki is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, data manipulation and
security bypass attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/mediawiki** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.11** |

### Background

MediaWiki is a collaborative editing software, used by big
projects like Wikipedia.

### Description

A security audit of the MediaWiki project discovered that
MediaWiki is vulnerable to several cross-site scripting and cross-site
request forgery attacks, and that the image deletion code does not
sufficiently sanitize input parameters.

### Impact

By tricking a user to load a carefully crafted URL, a remote
attacker could hijack sessions and authentication cookies to inject
malicious script code that will be executed in a user's browser session
in context of the vulnerable site, or use JavaScript submitted forms to
perform restricted actions. Using the image deletion flaw, it is also
possible for authenticated administrators to delete arbitrary files via
directory traversal.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MediaWiki users should upgrade to the latest available
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/mediawiki-1.3.11"
```
