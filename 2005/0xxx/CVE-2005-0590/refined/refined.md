        "vulnerability": "Spoofing of install URL using username:password",
        "details": "The vulnerability is present in InstallTrigger.install function, which doesn't check for username:password URL spoofing. An attacker could craft a URL like <http://update%2Emozilla%2Eorg%5C%5Cextensions%5C%5Csafe_as_houses@philringnalda.com/mozilla/livemarkthis.xpi> which would be displayed as <http://update.mozilla.org\\extensions\\safe_a> in the install dialog and trick user into installing a malicious extension. The vulnerability exists because the install dialog does not strip user:pass from the URL before display. The fix involves stripping user:pass from the URL before display." ,

         "vulnerability": "Install source spoofing with user:pass@host",
         "details": "The installation confirmation dialog shows the source of the software. By adding a long, fake \"user:pass\" in front of the true hostname, the user might be convinced to trust software that comes from an untrustworthy source. This is similar to attempts used in some phishing mail: \"http://www.mozilla.org@attacker.com/install.xpi\". By default Firefox only allows install attempts from http://update.mozilla.org, a user would need to explicitly allow the spoofing host to initiate installs before it could try this trick."
