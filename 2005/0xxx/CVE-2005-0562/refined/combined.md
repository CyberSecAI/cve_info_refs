## Microsoft MSN Messenger GIF processing buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#633446

Original Release Date: 2005-04-12 | Last Revised: 2005-04-12

---

### Overview

MSN Messenger clients before version 7.0 will allow remote attackers to take control of a computer if malicious GIF files are processed.

### Description

| Microsoft MSN Messenger is an instant messaging application that allows users to collaborate with people using text messages, voice and video communication, or by sending files. There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in a function MSN Messenger uses to process Graphic Interchange Format (GIF) image files. By sending a specially crafted GIF image file with unexpected height and width parameters, a remote attacker in a victim's contacts list could take control of a computer with the privileges of the affected user. Examples of GIF image files MSN Messenger typically processes include emoticons and display pictures.  Please note the updates from Microsoft in [MS05-022](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-022.mspx) addressing this issue supercede those in MS05-009. MSN Messenger 7.0 BETA is affected by this issue. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote attackers may execute arbitrary code with the privileges of affected users. Microsoft notes MSN Messenger does not by default anonymous user messages. An attecker must be in a victim's contacts list. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to either MSN Messenger 6.2.208 or MSN Messenger 7.0. Note MSN Messenger 7.0 BETA is affected by this issue.Non-technical users should read the following document:*MSN Messenger Update Summary for April 2005*<http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/200504_msnmessenger.mspx> More technical details can be found in the following security bulletin from Microsoft:*Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-022**Vulnerability in MSN Messenger Could Lead to Remote Code Execution (896597)*<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-022.mspx> |

Microsoft revised this bulletin to replace the download link for MSN Messenger 6.2 with the bulletin link to MS07-054, "Vulnerability in MSN Messenger and Windows Live Messenger Could Allow Remote Code Execution (942099)." This download link has been made obsolete by a required upgrade, depending on operating system, for MSN Messenger 6.2 in MS07-054. In fact, MS07-054 lists other MSN Messenger versions as well as Window Live Messenger 8.0 as affected software. Users may upgrade before logging on to either service by using the download links provided in MS07-054. Users who have not upgraded to non-vulnerable versions of MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger will be prompted by the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger service, respectively, upon logon.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security update. The security bulletin ID and affected operating systems are listed in the following table:

| **Bulletin ID** | **MSN Messenger 6.2** |
| --- | --- |
| **MS05-009** | Replaced\ |

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

No. MBSA does not support MSN Messenger, and will not detect whether the update is required for the affected software. However, Microsoft has developed a version of the [Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) that will help customers determine if the MSN Messenger security update is required.
For detailed information about the programs that MBSA currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460.](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460) For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, [detailed documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you need to apply this update. For more information about the version of the EST being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). For more detailed deployment information about the version of the EST being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193).

There is also a version of this tool that SMS customers can obtain from the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154). This tool may also be available for SMS customers from the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

No. SMS uses MBSA for detection and this update is not detected by MBSA. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

However, there is a version of the EST that SMS customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators from the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154).

The Security Update Inventory Tool is required for detecting Microsoft Windows and other affected Microsoft products. For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460)

For more information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

You can deploy this update by using the [Inventory and Software Distribution](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460) feature of SMS.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
