Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2005-0562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in how MSN Messenger processes GIF image files. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when handling malformed GIF files with unexpected height and width parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow within the GIF processing function of MSN Messenger. The application does not properly validate the height and width parameters of the GIF image, causing it to write beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's computer with the privileges of the affected user.
- **Complete System Control:** An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious GIF Files:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted GIF image file with manipulated height and width parameters to a vulnerable MSN Messenger user.
- **Contact List Required:** Attackers must be in the victim's contact list to send the malicious GIF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **MSN Messenger Contact:** The attacker must be in the victim's MSN Messenger contact list.
- **Crafted GIF:** The attacker needs the ability to create or obtain a specially crafted GIF image file containing malicious parameters.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious GIF via the MSN Messenger network.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects MSN Messenger clients before version 7.0, including MSN Messenger 6.2. MSN Messenger 7.0 BETA is also affected.
- Microsoft has released security updates (MS05-022) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted emoticon or display picture (which are commonly GIF files in MSN Messenger)
- Workarounds include removing unknown contacts, not accepting files from untrusted contacts, blocking MSN Messenger in corporate environments, blocking outgoing port 1863, or blocking HTTP access to specific MSN domains. However, some of these workarounds can reduce functionality.
