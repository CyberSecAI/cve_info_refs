- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `addentry.php` script in Woltlab Burning Book Lite does not properly filter the user-agent string before saving it to the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unfiltered user-agent string being used in a SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can modify the SQL query by manipulating the user-agent string. This could lead to data breaches, modification of data, or other malicious actions by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to send a crafted HTTP request to `addentry.php` containing a malicious user-agent string.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No special privileges are needed.
