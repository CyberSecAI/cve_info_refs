- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Adventia Chat application has HTML code enabled by default, allowing users to insert arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the chat interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Both static and remote XSS are possible. The entered text is persistent, allowing for continued exploitation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other chat users. This can lead to:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session spoofing
    - Pushing code to exploit users via browser vulnerabilities
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker sends malicious HTML or JavaScript code within the chat interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a chat user and have the ability to post messages in the chat.
