Date: 02 Apr 2005

Advisory: Luigi Auriemma
e-mail: aluigi@autistici.org
web: aluigi.org

4) Fix
#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
The Quake 3 engine is the well known game engine developed by ID
Software (http://www.idsoftware.com) and is used by many games.
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
This problem is enough known in the community of the Return to Castle
Wolfenstein and Enemy Territory games from many time (over one year),
and this second one is currently the only game to have an official
patch released just some weeks ago.
An interesting explanation of this bug and a method to fix it modifying
the source code of the vulnerable games (SDK) is available here:
http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?p=27322
In short the problem is in how the engine handles the commands longer
than 1022 chars, in fact they are automatically truncated at that size
and the rest of the chars is handled as network data confusing the
engine.
If an attacker joins a server and sends a too big message any client in
the server will automatically disconnect showing the
"CL\_ParseServerMessage: Illegible server message" error.
In some games or some of their older versions could happen also a
server crash, that's not caused by this bug but by other problems
explained in the following advisories:
http://aluigi.org/adv/jamsgbof-adv.txt
http://aluigi.org/adv/codmsgboom-adv.txt
Only in Soldier of Fortune II happens a clients crash instead of the
simple disconnection but the game supports only the vsay\_team command
and so only the players in the same team of the attacker will be
crashed.
The problem is in-game so the attacker must have access to the server,
if it is protected by password and he doesn't know the keyword or his
IP/guid has been banned he cannot exploit the bug.
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
- download the following file:
http://aluigi.org/poc/q3msgboom.cfg
- place it in the base folder of your game (like baseq3, etmain, main,
base and so on)
- start a client and a server or, if possible, more clients to test
better the effects of the bug
- join the server
- go into the console of a client (~ key or shift + ~)
- type: /exec q3msgboom
- any client in the server will disconnect immediately.
If nothing happens or the vsay command is not supported, modify the
q3msgboom.cfg file using other commands like say or vsay\_team.
Jedi Knight II needs that the script is executed some times before
seeing the effects.
#######################################################################
======
4) Fix
======
Currently only Enemy Territory 2.60 is officially fixed.
I have tried many times in these last weeks to find an universal way
to fix the bug but I had no luck, in fact the method suggested by
Banimod (http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?p=27322) is
ok but requires the recompilation of the SDK (where available).
Anyway the function to modify is located in the "game" code (the name
of a specific portion of the engine) that some games have built as a
DLL while others as a QVM file (harder to fix and zipped in the pk3
packages) and then the binary pattern of the function changes a lot
from game to game moreover because changes the G\_SEND\_SERVER\_COMMAND
value, so a binary fix based on the previously metioned patch is not
possible.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

this isnt exactly correct. its not a buffer overflow of the buffer (or the server would crash).

it's basically the client engine being retarded. ![:curse:](./images/smilies/b_curse.gif "Cursing")

if you send an oversize trap\_sendservercommand(), the server happily sends the data to the client. however the client (engine, not cgame) expects server commands to never be > 1022 characters. so the client engine truncates the received servercommand at 1022, and the client engine interprets the next character in the server command string as a network command byte.

the client then gets totally confused at this point trying to interpret the rest of the string as raw network protocol, and blows up.

here's a true fix. basically it logs oversize commands and drops them on the floor. this will stop the vsay exploit, and any similar exploits in the future.

g\_syscalls.c:

Code: Select all

```
void trap_SendServerCommand&#40; int clientNum, const char *text &#41; &#123;
        // rain - hack - commands over 1022 chars will crash the
        // client upon receipt, so ignore them
        if&#40; strlen&#40; text &#41; > 1022 &#41; &#123;
                G_LogPrintf&#40; "trap_SendServerCommand&#40; %d, ... &#41; length exceeds 1022.\n", clientNum &#41;;
                G_LogPrintf&#40; "text &#91;%s&#93;\n", text &#41;;
                return;
        &#125;
        syscall&#40; G_SEND_SERVER_COMMAND, clientNum, text &#41;;
&#125;

```

Bani

Is this for the server or the client?

And were does this (code)config need to go.
{Zer0}'s House of Torment 67.19.67.118:27960

{Zer0}'s RTCW server 67.19.67.119:27960

Now Lets Go Kick Some ASS

And thats an Order.

No, DG. Yer right... you can't stick this into a pk3. ![:)](./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif "Smile") Basically, it's a fix for the source code, which means you need to get the wet\_source package, find a compiler for Windows and Linux, and then rebuild the qagame so/DLL files.

And that's on the list of stuff bani mentioned they weren't going to cover. ![:)](./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif "Smile")

The fix is already in etpro, and this is really only relevant if you're trying to make your own mod.

DG: D'oh. ![:)](./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif "Smile")

Any rate, I was just wondering...

After grep'ing through the source this weekend, I ran across SanitizeString() in g\_cmds.c Could you just stick a bound check in there with something like

Code: Select all

```
void SanitizeString&#40; char *in, char* out, qboolean fToLower&#41;
&#123;
      int cnt = 0;
      while&#40; *in && cnt++ < 1022 &#41; &#123;
              /* same stuff */
      &#125;
      *out = 0;
&#125;

```

Or am I overly optimistic in assuming that they call this func every time the game accepts string input from the user? ![:(](./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif "Sad")

Just to clarify, it is not in 2.0.7. It is fixed in the NEXT version of ETPro.

Hrm. What I was thinking of was in the 2.0.7 announcement:
> bugfix: fix bug allowing spectators to crash the server - no, we arent going to tell you how to do it ![:)](./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif "Smile")

So this was something else besides an overflow? ![:(](./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif "Sad")

FWIW, G\_LowPrintf will only print the first 1023 chars (includng timestamp) so the above will always be truncated, eating the \n and leaving the next log message on the same line. Not that it really matters...

Wouldn't a length check of the string in G\_LogPrintf be better, than just upping the buffer?

3) The Code
4) Fix

#######################################################################

===============
1) Introduction
===============

The Quake 3 engine is the well known game engine developed by ID
Software (<http://www.idsoftware.com>) and is used by many games.

#######################################################################

======
2) Bug
======

This problem is enough known in the community of the Return to Castle
Wolfenstein and Enemy Territory games from many time (over one year),
and this second one is actually the only game to have an official patch
released just some weeks ago.

An interesting explanation of this bug and a method to fix it modifying
the source code of the vulnerable games (SDK) is available here:

  <http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?p=27322>

In short the problem is in how the engine handles the commands longer
than 1022 chars, in fact they are automatically truncated at that size
and the rest of the chars is handled as network data confusing the
engine.

If an attacker joins a server and sends a too big message any client in
the server will automatically disconnect showing the
"CL_ParseServerMessage: Illegible server message" error.

In some games or some of their older versions could happen also a
server crash, that's not caused by this bug but by other problems
explained in the following advisories:

  <http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/jamsgbof-adv.txt>
  <http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/codmsgboom-adv.txt>

Only in Soldier of Fortune II happens a clients crash instead of the
simple disconnection but the game supports only the vsay_team command
and so only the players in the same team of the attacker will be
crashed.

The problem is in-game so the attacker must have access to the server,
if it is protected by password and he doesn't know the keyword or his
IP/guid has been banned he cannot exploit the bug.

#######################################################################

===========
3) The Code
===========

- download the following file:
    <http://aluigi.altervista.org/poc/q3msgboom.cfg>
- place it in the base folder of your game (like baseq3, etmain, main,
  base and so on)
- start a client and a server or, if possible, more clients to test
  better the effects of the bug
- join the server
- go into the console of a client (~ key or shift + ~)
- type: /exec q3msgboom
- any client in the server will disconnect immediately.
  If nothing happens or the vsay command is not supported, modify the
  q3msgboom.cfg file using other commands like say or vsay_team.
  Jedi Knight II needs that the script is executed some times before
  seeing the effects.

#######################################################################

======
4) Fix
======

Currently only Enemy Territory 2.60 is officially fixed.

I have tried many times in these last weeks to find an universal way
to fix the bug but I had no luck, in fact the method suggested by
Banimod (<http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?p=27322>) is
ok but requires the recompilation of the SDK (where available).

Anyway the function to modify is located in the "game" code (the name
of a specific portion of the engine) that some games have built as a
DLL while others as a QVM file (harder to fix and zipped in the pk3
packages) and then the binary pattern of the function changes a lot
from game to game moreover because changes the G_SEND_SERVER_COMMAND
value, so a binary fix based on the previously metioned patch is not
possible.
