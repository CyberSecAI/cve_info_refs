How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SIG^2 Vulnerability Research Advisory

DeskNow Mail and Collaboration Server Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities

by Tan Chew Keong
Release Date: 02 Feb 2005

ADVISORY URL
<http://www.security.org.sg/vuln/desknow2512.html>

SUMMARY

DeskNow Mail and Collaboration Server (<http://www.desknow.com/desknowmc/index.html>) \
is a full-featured and integrated mail and instant messaging server, with webmail, \
secure instant messaging, document repository, shared calendars, address books, \
message boards, web-publishing, anti-spam features, Palm and PocketPC access and much \
more.

A directory traversal vulnerability was found in DeskNow webmail file attachment \
upload feature that may be exploited to upload files to arbitrary locations on the \
server. A malicious webmail user may upload a JSP file to the script directory of the \
server, and executing it by requesting the URL of the upload JSP file. A second \
directory traversal vulnerability exists in the document repository file delete \
feature. This vulnerability may be exploited to delete arbitrary files on the server. \

TESTED SYSTEM

DeskNow Mail and Collaboration Server Version 2.5.12 on English Win2K SP4

DETAILS

On the Windows platform, the default installation of DeskNow Mail and Collaboration \
Server runs its webmail service using Tomcat Application Server with LOCAL SYSTEM \
privilege. This advisory documents two directory traversal vulnerabilities that may \
be exploited by a malicious webmail user to upload/delete files to/from arbitrary \
directories.

1. Insufficient input sanitization in attachment.do allows file upload to arbitrary \
directories.

DeskNow's webmail allows a logon mail user to upload file attachments when composing \
an email. Lack of sanitization of the AttachmentsKey parameter allows the user to \
upload files to arbitrary location on the server.  More specifically, It is possible \
to use directory traversal characters to cause the uploaded file attachment to be \
saved outside the temporary directory. This may be exploited by a malicious webmail \
user to upload JSP files to the script execution directory of the server. After \
uploading the JSP file, it is possible to execute that file by directly requesting \
it's URL (i.e. http://[hostname]/desknow/jsp/test/poc.jsp). Successful exploitation \
will allow upload and execution of arbitrary JSP code with LOCAL SYSTEM privilege. \
E.g. a malicious user may upload a JSP file that gives him/her a reverse shell.

2. Insufficient input sanitization in file.do allows deleting of arbitrary files.

DeskNow's document repository feature allows a user to store files on the server via \
the web interface. A user is allowed to delete his/her own files. When the user \
selects his own file to be deleted, the file name is sent using the select_file \
parameter as a POST request to file.do. It is possible to use directory traversal \
characters within this parameter to delete files that do not belong to the user.

PATCH

Upgrade to DeskNow Mail and Collaboration Server Version 2.5.14 or later.
