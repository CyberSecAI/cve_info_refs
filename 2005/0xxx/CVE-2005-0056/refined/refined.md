Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-0056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Microsoft Internet Explorer handles Channel Definition Format (CDF) files. Specifically, it's related to how URLs within CDF files are validated by the browser's cross-domain security model.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-domain vulnerability:** The core issue is that the cross-domain security model of Internet Explorer is not properly enforced when processing CDF files. This allows a malicious actor to bypass the restrictions typically imposed between different domains or security zones.
*   Improper validation of URLs within CDF files. This leads to the possibility of executing code in a security context that is not permitted under normal conditions, such as the Local Machine Zone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This could give the attacker complete control over the affected system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can potentially lead to unintended information disclosure by allowing access to otherwise restricted data.
*   The malicious code would execute with the same privileges as the user running Internet Explorer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can craft a malicious webpage that contains a specially crafted CDF file. When a user visits this webpage, the exploit is triggered.
*   **Phishing/Social Engineering:** An attacker could use phishing tactics to trick a user into visiting a malicious web page or clicking a link.
*   **HTML Email:** While less direct, the vulnerability can be exploited by persuading a user to interact with a malicious HTML email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need any initial access to the victim's machine.
*   **Ability to Host Content:** The attacker needs to host a malicious web page or send an HTML email containing the exploit.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to visit the malicious webpage or interact with the malicious HTML email.
