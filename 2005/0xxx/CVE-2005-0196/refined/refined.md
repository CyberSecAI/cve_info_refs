{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A vulnerability exists in Cisco IOS's BGP implementation when the `bgp log-neighbor-changes` command is enabled, which allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by sending a malformed BGP packet.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the way Cisco IOS handles malformed BGP packets when the `bgp log-neighbor-changes` is enabled. The specific structure of the malicious packets is not disclosed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack could cause the affected device to reload, leading to a denial-of-service condition. Repeated exploitation could maintain the denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a malformed BGP packet sent to a vulnerable Cisco device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send BGP packets to the vulnerable device, and they must be a defined BGP peer of that device, which is required by BGP configuration."
