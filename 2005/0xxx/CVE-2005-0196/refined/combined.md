## Cisco IOS vulnerable to DoS via malformed BGP packet

#### Vulnerability Note VU#689326

Original Release Date: 2005-01-26 | Last Revised: 2005-01-26

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in Cisco's Internetwork Operating System (IOS) could result in a remotely exploitable denial of service.

### Description

| Cisco Internetwork Operating System ([IOS](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/732/ciscoios.html)) includes support for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is defined in [RFC 1771](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1771.txt). BGP is designed to exchange network reachability information between peer nodes. Information advertised by a BGP system to its peers includes timers, metrics, and paths to different Autonomous System (AS) networks. Routing between AS networks depends on BGP, and the Internet is a network of AS networks. Therefore, vulnerabilities in BGP have the potential to affect the Internet infrastructure.  A Cisco device running IOS that is enabled for BGP is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack via a malformed BGP packet. The specific nature of the crafted packets exploiting this vulnerability is not known. IOS is vulnerable only if the device is set up with the **bgp log-neighbor-changes** command. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By sending a specially crafted BGP packet to an affected device, a remote attacker could cause the device to reload. Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service condition. Because BGP must be configured to accept traffic from an explicitly defined peer, exploitation would be difficult from an untrusted host. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch or upgrade**Please refer to the "[Software Versions and Fixes](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20050126-bgp.shtml#software)" section of the [Cisco Security Advisory](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20050126-bgp.shtml) for more information on upgrading. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Cisco recommends a number of workarounds. For a complete list of workarounds, see the "[Workarounds](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20050126-bgp.shtml#workarounds)" section of the [Cisco Security Advisory](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20050126-bgp.shtml). |

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
