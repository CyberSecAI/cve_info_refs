- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `elvprsv` utility, when preserving a recovery file, places it in a world-readable directory with world-readable permissions. Additionally, the `elvrec` utility, another setuid root binary, allows users to recover files belonging to other users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leak due to world-readable permissions on recovery files and unauthorized file recovery.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive information can be leaked due to the world-readable recovery files. Users can recover files belonging to other users.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the `elvprsv` utility to save files, and then accessing the saved world-readable files. Exploiting the `elvrec` utility to recover files belonging to other users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user on the system with access to the world readable files. The user also needs access to the `elvrec` binary.
