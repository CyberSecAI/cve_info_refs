 Vulnerable: PBLang 4.65 (current) (and earlier?)

 ---

 General information:

 PBLang is an international BBS-software based on
PHP. It does not require any database but bases on a
flatfile system. Many professional features. More
info on the project website.

 ---

 Description:

 The search.php script is vulnerable to a XSS attack
by a remote attacker. The searched string is not
filtered for any harmfull characters like < > and ".
This makes it possible for an attacker to trick a
user into going to a harmfull page and stealing a
session.

 ---

 Proof Of Concept:

 Type in the search box "&lt;script
language="javascript">alert("Hackerlounge.com pwns
joo");&lt;/script&gt;" and submit. An alertbox with the
text "Hackerlounge.com pwns joo" should come up.

 ---

 Fix and Vendor status:

The vendor has been notified, expect an official
patch soon.

 Vulnerable: PBLang 4.65 (current) (and earlier?)

 ---

 General information:

 PBLang is an international BBS-software based on
PHP. It does not require any database but bases on a
flatfile system. Many professional features. More
info on the project website.

 ---

 Description:

 When a user receives a PM with a HTML in the
subject, it will be executed as soon as the user
opens his pm.php. This may give an attacker the
opportunity for a session steal. The link for the PM
will not be linked, so viewing the contents of the
message gets harder. An attacker could also flood a
users PM box by sending messages with a title like
&lt;script&gt;
 and the PM will not appear in the receivers window,
while it will say he/she has got a new PM.

 ---

 Proof Of Concept:

 Type in the subject box "&lt;script
language="javascript">alert("Hackerlounge.com pwns
joo");&lt;/script&gt;" and submit. An alertbox with the
text "Hackerlounge.com pwns joo" should come up when
a user visits pm.php.

 ---

 Fix and Vendor status:

Vendor has been notified, expect an official patch
soon.
