The provided content describes multiple XSS vulnerabilities in PBLang 4.65, but not all of them are related to the same file.

**Content 1: pmpshow.php XSS vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:** The `pmpshow.php` script does not sanitize the body of received private messages (PMs).
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation/sanitization for HTML characters (`<`, `>`, `"`) in user-supplied data.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the body of a PM, which will be executed when the victim views the message. This can lead to session hijacking, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a PM with a malicious script in the body.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Any user can send a message to another.

**Content 2: search.php XSS vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:** The `search.php` script does not sanitize the search string.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation/sanitization for HTML characters (`<`, `>`, `"`) in user-supplied data.
*    **Impact**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the search box, which will be executed when a user performs the search. This can lead to session hijacking, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Entering malicious script in the search box.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Any user can perform a search on the system.

**Content 3: pm.php XSS vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:** The `pm.php` script does not sanitize the subject of received private messages (PMs).
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation/sanitization for HTML characters (`<`, `>`, `"`) in user-supplied data.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the subject of a PM, which will be executed when the victim views their PMs. This can lead to session hijacking and also denial of service where the malicious script will prevent the user from seeing their messages and flood the inbox with non-displaying messages.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a PM with a malicious script in the subject line.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Any user can send a message to another.

**Summary:**

The content describes three different XSS vulnerabilities affecting different files within the PBLang software. All of them share the same underlying cause, which is the lack of input sanitization/validation which allows arbitrary JavaScript injection.

Given that the CVE description is missing it is impossible to ascertain which of the three vulnerabilities the CVE is referring to.

**Based on the files provided, the information is related to multiple vulnerabilities of type XSS. There is no direct information confirming it is the correct CVE, but the provided information is useful to characterize related vulnerabilities. Therefore, a response of NOINFO is not suitable.**
