How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## BIND 8.4.4 and 8.4.5 vulnerable to buffer overflow in q\_usedns

#### Vulnerability Note VU#327633

Original Release Date: 2005-01-25 | Last Revised: 2005-03-18

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the BIND name server could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service against an affected system.

### Description

| The [Berkeley Internet Name Domain](http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/) (BIND) is a popular Domain Name System (DNS) implementation from [Internet Systems Consortium](http://www.isc.org/) (ISC). A buffer overflow error exists in the handling of the q\_usedns array used by the server to track nameservers and addresses that have been queried. This vulnerability only affects BIND versions 8.4.4 and 8.4.5. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to cause the name server daemon to crash, thereby causing a denial of service for DNS operations. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**  Patches have been released in response to this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document.**Upgrade**Users who compile their own versions of BIND from the original ISC source code are encouraged to upgrade to BIND version 8.4.6 which includes a patch for this issue. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  ISC recommends that users who are unable to apply the patch disable recursion and glue fetching. |
