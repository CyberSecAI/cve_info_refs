  <http://bugs.debian.org/329156>

Extracts from above:

 Paul Szabo <psz@maths.usyd.edu.au>:
  gnome-pty-helper can be made to write utmp/wtmp records with arbitrary
  DISPLAY (host) settings. ...
  ...
  I do not know any root escalation methods. ... cannot think of any
  "important" uses of utmp/wtmp files. ...

 Steve Langasek, Debian Developer:
  Hmm... After rereading the definition at
  <<http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities>>, I guess there's no
  reason for this bug to not fall under the description of 'critical',
  since the security hole is present just from the installation of the
  package.

 Lo=EFc Minier:
  This vulnerability is identified as CAN-2005-0023.  The upstream
  developers of vte have been notified of the bug at:
    <<http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=317312>>

 Martin Schulze (Joey):
  being able to write arbitrary strings into valid records without
  overwriting any other data in utmp/wtmp can hardly be classified
  as a security vulnerability.
  ...
  Ok, so unless somebody proves us wrong we don't consider this a
  security problem.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=317312#c0)  LoÃ¯c Minier    2005-09-27 07:46:37 UTC  ``` Hi,  This vulnerability is identified as CAN-2005-0023.  Paul Szabo exposed proof of concept code to record arbitrary DISPLAY strings to the utmp records in Debian bug <<http://bugs.debian.org/329156>>.  This bug affects vte's code, but was reported against it's GNOME 1 counterpart, libzvt2.  One workaround he suggests is that gnome-pty-helper verifies the DISPLAY is correct, by connecting to it.  Bye, ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=317312#c1)  AndrÃ© Klapper    2006-10-02 09:06:37 UTC  ``` any updates on this? behdad perhaps? (i know that the severity of this issue has been disputed.) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=317312#c2)  Behdad Esfahbod    2006-10-02 18:18:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=317312#c1)) > any updates on this? behdad perhaps? > (i know that the severity of this issue has been disputed.)  Last time I looked into this, it was not worth the time fixing it.  The only fix that comes to mind is to try opening the DISPLAY first, but that requires depending on Xlib. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=317312#c3)  AndrÃ© Klapper    2006-10-04 18:15:22 UTC  ``` so, WONTFIX? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=317312#c4)  Behdad Esfahbod    2006-10-04 18:42:54 UTC  ``` I'll leave it open until someone writes a patch. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=317312#c5)  AndrÃ© Klapper    2006-10-05 07:35:01 UTC  ``` removing old target milestone then, thanks for the quick feedback. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=317312#c6)  Christian Persch    2015-05-09 17:29:03 UTC  ``` Obsolete now that g-p-h has been removed. ``` |  |

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: /usr/sbin/gnome-pty-helper: writes arbitrary utmp records
Date: Tue, 20 Sep 2005 09:01:20 +1000
```
Package: libzvt2
Version: 1.4.2-19
Severity: critical
File: /usr/sbin/gnome-pty-helper
Justification: root security hole

gnome-pty-helper can be made to write utmp/wtmp records with arbitrary
DISPLAY (host) settings. I am not sure if it can be tricked into erasing
existing records.

Demo output, code below.

Cheers,

Why is this filed at severity: critical?  What is the attack vector here
which permits root privilege escalation?

I do not know any root escalation methods. When using reportbug, those
options seemed to fit best, apologies if they were not; please change if
appropriate. (For future reference: which options should I have used
instead?)

(In fact cannot think of any attacks: cannot think of any "important" uses
of utmp/wtmp files. I use utmp in some of my own scripts, that is how I
looked at gnome-tty-helper.)

Hmm... After rereading the definition at
<<http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities>>, I guess there's no reason
for this bug to not fall under the description of 'critical', since the
security hole is present just from the installation of the package.

 Thanks for your report.

 Do you have a CVE ID for this security issue?

 Did you check whether libvte4 is affected?

 Do you have a fix?

Dear Loic,

No. Sorry, I do not know how to get one. (Nor am sure if this is serious
enough to deserve one.)

No. Do not know what libvte4 is.

>  Do you have a fix?

No. (Fanciful idea: try running xhost, if it fails then surely you do not
"own" that display. Slow, maybe secure. That is what I use now.)

 Then I'll see whether it deserves one, and attempt to request one.

 libvte4 is the GNOME 2 zquivalent of libzvt2, you can grab it from:
    <<http://packages.debian.org/>>
 the source package for this library is "vte".

 I'd be nice if you could check whether the gnome-pty-helper shipped in
 libvte4 is affected too.  Let me know if you don't have a setup
 permitting the check, or if you lack the time.

Looking at the source

  vte-0.11.15/gnome-pty-helper/gnome-pty-helper.c

in line 682 it grabs
	display_name = getenv ("DISPLAY");
and uses it without any sanity checks: yes, surely it is also affected.

I have not yet found any uses for utmp/wtmp: maybe Joey is right and there
is no security issue. I would then suggest that to increase security,
setuid/setgid bits be removed from all utmp/wmtp maintainers.

In the meantime, I hope that conscientious sysadmins do look at who and
last output occasionally; an expect that

psz@savona:~$ exploit "$(perl -e 'print "XX)\nroot     tty01        Jan 01 02:03 (insecure.com"')" & sleep 1; who; sleep 6

utmp record will be cleaned up when we exit.

I found a (wrongful) use for it recently, /bin/login relies on ut_line
and chowns that to the user, see

  <http://bugs.debian.org/505271>

That is "not this bug", as this allows us to fake ut_host only...

The libvte4 package has been removed from Debian. We are reassigning
its bugs to the vte package. Please have a look at them,
and close them if they don't apply to vte anymore.

Don't hesitate to reply to this mail if you have any question.

Kind regards,

FYI:

VTE (Debian package name: libvte-2.91-0) no longer ships gnome-pty-helper
as of version 0.42.

VTE, and in turn gnome-terminal, no longer does utmp/wtmp logging at all.

See <https://git.gnome.org/browse/vte/commit/?id=299c700> and
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=747046> for further details.

cheers,

Since 2019 (before Debian 11), the vte source package in Debian no longer
installs gnome-pty-helper, so any remaining bugs in gnome-pty-helper
are no longer relevant to its security posture.

For all purposes except the GTK2-based Debian installer, vte has been
replaced by the GTK3/GTK4-based vte2.91, but that package also stopped
providing gnome-pty-helper in 2015 (version 0.42.0-1).

libzvt was also removed from Debian, back in 2008.

So there is no longer a gnome-pty-helper in any supported branch of
Debian, in any descendant of the libzvt package in which [CVE-2005-0023](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0023)
was originally reported, and I'm closing this bug now.
