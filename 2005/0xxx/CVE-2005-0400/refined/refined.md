  "CVE-2005-0400": {
    "description": "The ext2 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.11.6, and 2.4 before 2.4.30, does not initialize the ext2 block when a new directory is created, which allows local users to read portions of kernel memory by creating a directory, then reading the directory.",
    "technical_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `ext2_make_empty()` function. When creating a new directory, the ext2 block written to disk is not initialized, resulting in an information leak of kernel memory. A local attacker with the ability to create a directory can exploit this to read portions of kernel memory by creating a directory and then reading its contents.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can read portions of kernel memory.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create directories in the file system."
  },
  "CVE-2005-0750": {
    "description": "The L2CAP implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.11.6 does not properly check the signedness of an integer value when creating a socket, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by creating a negative-sized socket.",
        "technical_details": "The vulnerability is in how the Linux kernel handles socket creation for L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) connections in Bluetooth. It fails to check the signedness of the integer value that determines the size of the socket, so a user could create a socket with a negative size which could lead to DoS or privilege escalation. The patch addresses the signedness issue in socket creation.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Incorrect signedness check",
          "Potential denial of service",
           "Potential Privilege Escalation"
        ],
        "impact": "Denial of service and potential privilege escalation",
        "attack_vector": "Local Access",
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to create a negative-sized socket."

   "CVE-2005-0749": {
        "description": "The load_elf_library function in the Linux kernel before 2.6.11.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted ELF file, which modifies `elf_phdata` before it is freed.",
        "technical_details": "The `load_elf_library` function in the Linux kernel was vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The function would modify the `elf_phdata` structure before freeing it, leading to a crash. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious ELF file that triggers this condition.",
         "vulnerabilities": [
          "Denial of Service"

        "impact": "Denial of Service (Kernel Crash)",

    "CVE-2005-0815": {
        "description": "Multiple range checking errors in the isofs filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.11.6 allow local users to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted ISO9660 image.",
        "technical_details": "The vulnerability is due to multiple range checking flaws in the iso9660 filesystem. Specifically, when processing rock-ridge extensions, the kernel does not correctly handle corrupted data. This can lead to memory corruption or a system crash. Multiple patches were applied to improve the handling of these corrupt images.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
            "Range checking errors"
