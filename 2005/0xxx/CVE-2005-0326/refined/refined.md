The content describes a vulnerability in paFileDB 3.1, which is a file download management script. It details a full path disclosure and a PHP injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `$action` variable in `pafiledb.php` on line 25 within an include statement: `include "./includes/$action/login.php";`. The `$action` variable is not initialized or sanitized before being used in the include function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Full Path Disclosure:** When a non-existent file path is provided via the `$action` parameter, PHP's error messages reveal the server's local file path.
2.  **PHP Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious PHP code by manipulating the `$action` variable which will then be included in the php script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1. **Full Path Disclosure:** The full path disclosure reveals sensitive information about the server's file system structure, which could aid further attacks.
2. **PHP Injection:** An attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by injecting a file path that includes malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL with the `login=do` and manipulated `action` parameters. Example: `http://www.example.com/pafiledb.php?login=do&action=[malicious_value]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected `pafiledb.php` script, so they can be any remote attacker. They need no prior authentication.
