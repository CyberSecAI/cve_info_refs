- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied data from CSV files before being used in SQL queries. Specifically, single quotes are not filtered.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data manipulation or information disclosure. The advisory notes that the impact is rated low because it would be easier to inject malicious data through the CSV file itself.
- **Attack vectors:** Uploading a specially crafted CSV file containing malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to upload CSV files into the CitrusDB application. This implies they need to be a special/authorized user.
