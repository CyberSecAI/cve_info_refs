# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-09

## Browser responds to proxy auth request from non-proxy server (ssl/https)

Announced
January 21, 2005
Reporter
Christopher Nebergall
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.5

### Description

If a proxy is configured the browser would respond to a 407 proxy auth
request from any SSL-connected server rather than only responding to
the configured proxy server. This could leak NTLM or SPNEGO credentials
outside the organization.

### Workaround

Upgrade to the fixed version

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=267263#c0)• 20 years ago |

I haven't seen anywhere in the code where auto-send proxy auth like NTLM and now
SPNEGO are checked to make sure that the proxy server which is configured on the
channel is actually the same server that is sending the 407 to the client. Did
I miss something?
What would happen if I was connecting to an SSL protected site which uses the
connect method through the proxy and that site sends a 407 w/ NTLM or SPNEGO?
Would the browser autosend my credentials out site of my network just because a
proxy was configured for that channel?

I think you are correct. The test for UsingHttpProxy() should have been
accompanied with a test for !UsingSSL(). This is a serious security flaw.

|  | |

Actually, testing for UsingSSL() is not sufficient. We need to allow 407
responses from the SSL proxy server itself, but we need to reject them once we
are successfully connected. That is going to be tricky to implement.

This patch should do the trick. NOTE: I haven't built a testcase for this yet,
but I wanted to post this anyways, so my approach could be reviewed.

v1 patch - tested
ok, i tested this patch using a squid proxy server configured to allow CONNECT
requests and an apache server hosting a CGI script that output a 407 response.
i used apache's "nph" feature to create the CGI script:
$ cat nph-test.cgi
#!/bin/sh
echo 'HTTP/1.0 407 Proxy Auth'
echo 'Proxy-Authenticate: basic "dummy"'
echo 'Connection: close'
echo ''
echo 'hello'
without my patch loading <https://localhost/nph-test.cgi> would result in a
prompt for proxy authentication.
with my patch, there was no prompt, and the contents of the 407 response were
displayed in the browser window.
it's arguable that we should maybe not even show content in this case, since it
is likely a spoofing attempt, but i wanted to keep the patch as simple as
possible for now.

I also verified that SSL proxy authentication still works :-)

I still don't quite understand the need for !mTransaction->SSLConnectFailed().
AFAIK SSL Proxy servers don't encrypt or decrypt SSL so if the browser is using
SSL then its response will not be readable by the proxy server and must be going
to the end server.
Bugzilla seems to be having database errors, so if this gets reposted I appologize.

[Not specific to this patch]
The Mozilla code makes the (presumably valid) assumption that all proxy
authenticate headers are added by the proxy server and stripped by the proxy
server if they actually come from an end server. Is this assumption still true
if a user is using a Socks proxy or is a socks proxy to generic to care about
HTTP headers?

Yes, but before we start speaking SSL over the connection, we first have to
speak plaintext HTTP to issue the CONNECT request. The response to the CONNECT
request could be a 407 response from the SSL proxy itself. After a 200 response
from the CONNECT request, we "step up" the connection to SSL.

We don't support talking to a HTTP proxy over a SOCKS connection at the moment.
We also don't make any assumptions about a SOCKS proxy modifying the HTTP
transactions. UsingHttpProxy() is false when a SOCKS proxy is configured.

The security Advisory for this bug is now public
<http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/mfsa2005-09.html>
Unfortunately, it states that this bug is NTLM/SPNEGO specific. It should work
equally well with any auth type including stealing basic passwords (I didn't
realize this when I opened the bug, it only came out later in further comments).
Maybe in the future developers/reporters on security bugs should write an
updated security summary when the bug is fixed and put the URI of the comment on
the whiteboard so whoever writes the summaries doesn't have to read the whole
thread to find out the implications or extent of the bug.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
