{
  "cve": "CVE-2005-0147",
  "attack_vector": "An attacker could configure a malicious SSL-connected server to send a 407 proxy authentication request, even though it's not the configured proxy server.",
  "root_cause": "The browser was not verifying that the server sending a 407 proxy authentication request was the actual configured proxy server when using SSL connections.",
  "affected_software": [
    "Firefox",
    "Mozilla Suite"
  ],
  "vulnerability": "The browser would respond to a 407 proxy auth request from any SSL-connected server rather than only responding to the configured proxy server.",
  "impact": "This could leak NTLM, SPNEGO, or basic authentication credentials outside the organization.",
  "remediation": "Upgrade to the fixed version (Firefox 1, Mozilla Suite 1.7.5).",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or compromise an SSL-connected server.",
  "more_info": "The advisory initially stated the bug was NTLM/SPNEGO specific, but it also affects other auth types, potentially leading to the theft of basic passwords."
