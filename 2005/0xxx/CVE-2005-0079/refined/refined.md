- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `xtrlock` program.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious local attacker can exploit the buffer overflow to crash the lock program and take over the desktop session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable locally.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `xtrlock` is running.
