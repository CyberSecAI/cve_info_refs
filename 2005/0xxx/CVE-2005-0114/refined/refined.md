{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the Inter Process Communication (IPC) functions of ZoneAlarm products. The software monitors specific IPC messages, and specially crafted code can cause the software or system to lock.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of IPC messages allows for a system lock.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can cause the system to lock.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local system access is required. The attacker needs to send specially crafted IPC messages.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have local access to the system."
