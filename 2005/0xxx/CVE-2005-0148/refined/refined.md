Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- Thunderbird was launching javascript: links using the operating system's default handler for that scheme, which on Windows was Internet Explorer (IE), even if Firefox was set as the default browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Handling of Javascript URLs:** Thunderbird was not handling javascript: URLs internally. Instead, it was relying on the OS to delegate these URLs to the registered handler, which was IE.
- **Exposure to IE Vulnerabilities:** By launching javascript: URLs in IE, Thunderbird exposed users to any security vulnerabilities present in the installed version of IE. This is problematic, as users may be using Thunderbird and Firefox to avoid the security risks associated with IE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Moderate to Critical:** The impact is categorized as moderate to critical, depending on the vulnerabilities present in the installed version of IE. An attacker could potentially exploit IE vulnerabilities to execute malicious code or perform other malicious actions within the context of IE.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Users might expect that clicking a javascript link within a Thunderbird email would be handled by Thunderbird or Firefox, the default browser. The unexpected launch of IE could catch users off-guard, as they might assume they are not exposed to IE-related vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTML Emails:** An attacker could send an HTML email containing a javascript: link. When the user clicks on the link, Thunderbird would launch IE to handle it, opening a path for exploiting IE vulnerabilities.
- **RSS Feeds:** Similar to HTML emails, malicious javascript: links embedded in RSS feed items could also trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted email or RSS feed item with a malicious javascript: link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is a result of Thunderbird's failure to properly handle javascript: URLs, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security risks by relying on a potentially insecure external handler.
- The fix involves ensuring that Thunderbird handles javascript: and data: URLs internally, and prevents them from being handled by external applications.
- The bug report also highlights the conflict between the 'default behavior' of using the OS's handler, versus user expectations when using a security focused mail client like thunderbird.
