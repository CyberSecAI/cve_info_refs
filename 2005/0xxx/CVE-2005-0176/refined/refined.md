  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-0176",
      "description": "An insufficient permission check in the shmctl() function in the Linux kernel allows any process to lock/unlock System V shared memory segments within the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK limit, potentially allowing unprivileged users to swap out locked memory of other processes. Locked shared memory is often used for storing sensitive data like passphrases, which should not be written to swap space.",
      "root_cause": "Insufficient permission checking in the shmctl() function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate access control",
        "Improper privilege management"
      ],
       "impact": "An unprivileged user can cause other processes' locked memory to be swapped out, potentially exposing sensitive information stored in shared memory (such as passphrases) that should not be written to disk.",
      "attack_vector": "Local access",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unprivileged user needs to execute a process capable of calling the shmctl() function to lock/unlock memory segments."
