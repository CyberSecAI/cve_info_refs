Ubuntu Security Notice USN-82-1		  February 15, 2005
linux-source-2.6.8.1 vulnerabilities
CAN-2005-0176, CAN-2005-0177, CAN-2005-0178
<http://oss.sgi.com/archives/netdev/2005-01/msg01036.html>
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)

The following packages are affected:

linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-386
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-686
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-686-smp
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-amd64-generic
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-amd64-k8
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-amd64-k8-smp
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-amd64-xeon
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-k7
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-k7-smp
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-power3
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-power3-smp
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-power4
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-power4-smp
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-powerpc
linux-image-2.6.8.1-5-powerpc-smp
linux-source-2.6.8.1

The problem can be corrected by upgrading the affected package to
version 2.6.8.1-16.11. You need to reboot the computer after doing a
standard system upgrade to effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change this kernel got a new
version number, which requires to recompile and reinstall all third
party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use
linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to
get modules which work with the new kernel version.

Details follow:

CAN-2004-0176:

  Michael Kerrisk noticed an insufficient permission checking in the
  shmctl() function. Any process was permitted to lock/unlock any
  System V shared memory segment that fell within the the
  RLIMIT_MEMLOCK limit (that is the maximum size of shared memory that
  unprivileged users can acquire). This allowed am unprivileged user
  process to unlock locked memory of other processes, thereby allowing
  them to be swapped out.  Usually locked shared memory is used to
  store passphrases and other sensitive content which must not be
  written to the swap space (where it could be read out even after a
  reboot).

CAN-2005-0177:

  OGAWA Hirofumi noticed that the table sizes in nls_ascii.c were
  incorrectly set to 128 instead of 256. This caused a buffer overflow
  in some cases which could be exploited to crash the kernel.

CAN-2005-0178:

  A race condition was found in the terminal handling of the
  "setsid()" function, which is used to start new process sessions.

[http://oss.sgi.com/archives/netdev/2005-01/msg01036.html:](http://oss.sgi.com/archives/netdev/2005-01/msg01036.html%3A)

  David Coulson noticed a design flaw in the netfilter/iptables module.
  By sending specially crafted packets, a remote attacker could exploit
  this to crash the kernel or to bypass firewall rules.

  Fixing this vulnerability required a change in the Application
  Binary Interface (ABI) of the kernel. This means that third party
  user installed modules might not work any more with the new kernel,
  so this fixed kernel has a new ABI version number. You have to
  recompile and reinstall all third party modules.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
