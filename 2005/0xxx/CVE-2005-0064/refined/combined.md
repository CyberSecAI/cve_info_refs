# Xpdf, GPdf: Stack overflow in Decrypt::makeFileKey2 — GLSA **200501-28**

A stack overflow was discovered in Xpdf, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code. GPdf includes Xpdf code and therefore is
vulnerable to the same issue.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/xpdf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **3.00-r7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.00-r8** |

| Package | **app-text/gpdf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.8.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.8.2** |

### Background

Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
files. GPdf is a Gnome-based PDF viewer that includes some Xpdf code.

### Description

iDEFENSE reports that the Decrypt::makeFileKey2 function in Xpdf's
Decrypt.cc insufficiently checks boundaries when processing /Encrypt
/Length tags in PDF files.

### Impact

An attacker could entice an user to open a specially-crafted PDF
file which would trigger a stack overflow, potentially resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running Xpdf or
GPdf.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Xpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/xpdf-3.00-r8"
```

All GPdf users should also upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/gpdf-2.8.2"
```

# pdftohtml: Vulnerabilities in included Xpdf — GLSA **200502-10**

pdftohtml includes vulnerable Xpdf code to handle PDF files, making it
vulnerable to execution of arbitrary code upon converting a malicious PDF
file.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/pdftohtml** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.36-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.36-r3** |

### Background

pdftohtml is a utility to convert PDF files to HTML or XML
formats. It makes use of Xpdf code to decode PDF files.

### Description

Xpdf is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, as described in GLSA
200501-28.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to convert a specially-crafted PDF
file, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running pdftohtml.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All pdftohtml users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/pdftohtml-0.36-r3"
```
### References

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze

Package        : cupsys
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0064

iDEFENSE has reported a buffer overflow in xpdf, the portable document
format (PDF) suite.  Similar code is present in the PDF processing
part of CUPS.  A maliciously crafted PDF file could exploit this
problem, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.14-5woody12.

In the unstable distribution (sid) CUPSYS does not use its own xpdf
variant anymore but uses xpdf-utils.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : xpdf
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0064

iDEFENSE has reported a buffer overflow in xpdf, the portable document
format (PDF) suite.  A maliciously crafted PDF file could exploit this
problem, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.00-3.4.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.00-12.

We recommend that you upgrade your xpdf package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
