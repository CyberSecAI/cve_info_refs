```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The MediaPartner 5.0 web server is vulnerable to directory traversal due to insufficient input validation and allows an attacker to access files outside the intended web-published file system directory by using "../" sequences in the HTTP request.
The directory-browsing page generated by the directory traversal vulnerability is vulnerable to URL cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Directory Traversal
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Impact of exploitation:
- Directory traversal allows attackers to gain access to any file on the drive where the web-published file system is installed.
- Cross-site scripting allows attackers to execute malicious code in the victim's browser when they follow a crafted URL.

Attack vectors:
- Sending an HTTP request containing "../" sequences to traverse directories.
- Crafting a URL containing malicious code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit it due to the XSS vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that the victim will click on.
