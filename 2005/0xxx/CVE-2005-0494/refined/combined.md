How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I found a vulnerability in this cablemodem which a malicious user inside *LAN
can get the control of the cablemodem easily.
This cablemodem model is given by the spanish ISP "AUNA".

Details
=======

Product: Thomson TCW690 cablemodem
Affected Version: ST42.03.0a (not tested in minor versions)
Immune Version: ???
Security-Risk: high
Exploit: yes
Product-URL:
<http://www.thomson.net/EN/Home/MiniSites/BAP/Cable/ModelDetail.html?category=cab%20modem%20Eurodocsis&model=TCW690> \

Vendor-URL: <http://www.thomson.net/>
Vendor-Status: informed but no response

Description
===========

The http server inside this cablemodem doesn't properly validate the supplied
password when an user want to do some change in the configuration and sends a
POST request. In the exploit I show how to change the admin password but you
can also open ports, deny a user access, restore factory defaults, (all)...
with a little changes.

Exploit
=======

Attached.
