## SquirrelMail vulnerable to command injection because of flawed input checking in S/MIME plug-in

#### Vulnerability Note VU#502328

Original Release Date: 2005-02-09 | Last Revised: 2005-02-10

---

### Overview

SquirrelMail contains a flaw in its S/MIME plug-in certificate handling routines which may allow arbitrary code to be remotely executed.

### Description

| From the [SquirrelMail web page](http://www.squirrelmail.org/):  SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4. It includes built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and all pages render in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across browsers. It has very few requirements and is very easy to configure and install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality you would want from an email client, including strong MIME support, address books, and folder manipulation.SquirrelMail's input handling contains a flaw that may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The S/MIME plug-in fails to check the $cert variable, which contains user-supplied data, before using the variable in a call to exec(). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to supply arbitrary code to be executed in the call to exec() with the privileges of the web server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**SquirrelMail has released an updated version of the S/MIME plug-in that is not affected by this flaw. Version 0.6 (or later) does not contain this flaw and can be obtained from the [SquirrelMail S/MIME plug-in page](http://www.squirrelmail.org/plugin_view.php?id=54). |
