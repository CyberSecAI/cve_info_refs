Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-0396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the DCOP (Desktop Communication Protocol) daemon, known as `dcopserver`, used in KDE. The vulnerability is related to the authentication process within DCOP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `dcopserver` can be stalled in the authentication process by a local user. This does not bypass the authentication but halts the process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can stall the `dcopserver` of other users.
- **Reduced Desktop Functionality:** All desktop functionalities relying on DCOP cease to function. This can include, but is not limited to, the inability to browse the internet and start new applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Inter-user Attack:** An attacker can target the `dcopserver` of other users on the same machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a local user on the system. No special privileges beyond a normal user account are required.

**Summary:**

A local user can exploit a flaw in the DCOP authentication process to cause a denial-of-service attack on other users' sessions. This happens by stalling the `dcopserver` process. This attack requires local access and will effectively break any functionality dependent on DCOP.
