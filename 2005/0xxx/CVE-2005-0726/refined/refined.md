- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `editpost.php` script in UBB.threads version 6 does not properly sanitize user input before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the `$Number` variable, obtained from the GET parameter, is directly inserted into the SQL query without validation or sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation on the `$Number` parameter in `editpost.php`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, or other malicious activities on the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `editpost.php` using a crafted `Number` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
