How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 666-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
February 4th, 2005                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : python2.2
Vulnerability  : design flaw
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0089

The Python development team has discovered a flaw in their language
packge.  The SimpleXMLRPCServer library module could permit remote
attackers unintended access to internals of the registered object or
its module or possibly other modules.  The flaw only affects Python
XML-RPC servers that use the register_instance() method to register an
object without a _dispatch() method.  Servers using only
register_function() are not affected.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-4.7.  No other version of Python in woody is affected.

For the testing (sarge) and unstable (sid) distributions the following
matrix explains which version will contain the correction in which
version:

               testing                   unstable
Python 2.2     2.2.3-14                  2.2.3-14
Python 2.3     2.3.4-20               2.3.4+2.3.5c1-2
Python 2.4      2.4-5                     2.4-5

We recommend that you upgrade your Python packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Python Security Advisory

Advisory ID:  PSF-2005-001
Issue Date:   February 3, 2005
Product:      Python
Versions:     2.2 all versions, 2.3 prior to 2.3.5, 2.4
CVE Names:    CAN-2005-0089
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.

The Python development team has discovered a flaw in the
SimpleXMLRPCServer library module which can give remote attackers
access to internals of the registered object or its module or possibly
other modules.  The flaw only affects Python XML-RPC servers that use
the register_instance() method to register an object without a
_dispatch() method.  Servers using only register_function() are not
affected.

On vulnerable XML-RPC servers, a remote attacker may be able to view
or modify globals of the module(s) containing the registered
instance's class(es), potentially leading to data loss or arbitrary
code execution.  If the registered object is a module, the danger is
particularly serious.  For example, if the registered module imports
the os module, an attacker could invoke the os.system() function.

But the attack is not limited to registered object modules; for
example, the code in the Python cookbook recipe at
<http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/165375> is
vulnerable to an attack using im_func.func_globals.update which allows
reading or modifying the global variable accessList.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2005-0089 to this issue.

Python 2.3.5 will be released from [www.python.org](http://www.python.org) within a few days
containing a fix for this issue.  Python 2.4.1 will be released later
this month containing the same fix.  Patches for Python 2.2, 2.3 and
2.4 are also immediately available:

- <http://python.org/security/PSF-2005-001/patch-2.2.txt> (Python 2.2)

- <http://python.org/security/PSF-2005-001/patch.txt> (Python 2.3, 2.4)

Note that these patches disable recursive traversal, potentially
resulting in reduced functionality of XML-RPC applications depending
on this feature.
