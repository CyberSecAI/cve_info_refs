Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Suite handle HTTP authentication prompts in a tabbed browsing environment. Specifically, when an HTTP authentication dialog is triggered from a background tab, it would appear over the currently focused tab, rather than the tab that initiated the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Spoofing/UI Redressing:** The primary weakness is the potential for UI spoofing. By having the authentication dialog appear over the wrong tab, an attacker could mislead a user into believing that the authentication request is associated with the currently focused site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** A successful exploit could lead to the theft of user credentials. An attacker could craft a malicious website, trick a user into opening it in a background tab, and then, through an HTTP authentication request, prompt for credentials, making the user believe they are authenticating with the currently active tab which can be a high value target.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The attack vector involves a malicious website that triggers an HTTP authentication request.
*   **Tabbed Browsing:** The attack relies on the user having multiple tabs open, with the malicious site residing in a background tab.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host a Website:** The attacker must be able to host a website that can initiate an HTTP authentication request.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must use social engineering to convince the user to open their malicious website in a background tab and also access another high-value website in another tab.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Christian Schmidt.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the HTTP authentication prompt appears above the tab that triggered it.
*   The issue was addressed in Firefox 1.0.1 and Mozilla Suite 1.7.6.
*   The bug report ([Bug 277574](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=277574)) provides a detailed timeline of the vulnerability discovery, patching process and the fixes applied for different branches.
