# Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-30**

The Mozilla Suite is vulnerable to multiple issues ranging from the remote
execution of arbitrary code to various issues allowing to trick the user
into trusting fake web sites or interacting with privileged content.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.6** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.6** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that
includes a mail and news reader.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla
Suite:

* Mark Dowd from ISS X-Force reported an exploitable
  heap overrun in the GIF processing of obsolete Netscape extension 2
  (CAN-2005-0399)
* Michael Krax reported that plugins can be used
  to load privileged content and trick the user to interact with it
  (CAN-2005-0232, CAN-2005-0527)
* Michael Krax also reported
  potential spoofing or cross-site-scripting issues through overlapping
  windows, image or scrollbar drag-and-drop, and by dropping javascript:
  links on tabs (CAN-2005-0230, CAN-2005-0231, CAN-2005-0401,
  CAN-2005-0591)
* Daniel de Wildt and Gael Delalleau discovered a
  memory overwrite in a string library (CAN-2005-0255)
* Wind Li
  discovered a possible heap overflow in UTF8 to Unicode conversion
  (CAN-2005-0592)
* Eric Johanson reported that Internationalized
  Domain Name (IDN) features allow homograph attacks (CAN-2005-0233)
* Mook, Doug Turner, Kohei Yoshino and M. Deaudelin reported various
  ways of spoofing the SSL "secure site" indicator (CAN-2005-0593)
* Georgi Guninski discovered that XSLT can include stylesheets from
  arbitrary hosts (CAN-2005-0588)
* Secunia discovered a way of
  injecting content into a popup opened by another website
  (CAN-2004-1156)
* Phil Ringnalda reported a possible way to
  spoof Install source with user:pass@host (CAN-2005-0590)
* Jakob
  Balle from Secunia discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download
  dialog source (CAN-2005-0585)
* Christian Schmidt reported a
  potential spoofing issue in HTTP auth prompt tab (CAN-2005-0584)
* Finally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
  discovered that Mozilla insecurely creates temporary filenames in
  /tmp/plugtmp (CAN-2005-0578)

### Impact

* The GIF heap overflow could be triggered by a malicious GIF
  image that would end up executing arbitrary code with the rights of the
  user running Mozilla. The other overflow issues, while not thought to
  be exploitable, would have the same impact
* By setting up
  malicious websites and convincing users to follow untrusted links or
  obey very specific drag-and-drop or download instructions, attackers
  may leverage the various spoofing issues to fake other websites to get
  access to confidential information, push users to download malicious
  files or make them interact with their browser preferences
* The
  temporary directory issue allows local attackers to overwrite arbitrary
  files with the rights of another local user

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.6"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.6"
```

|  | |

This is related to [bug 262887](/show_bug.cgi?id=262887 "VERIFIED FIXED - Secunia background tab security issues (SA12712 - less critical) -"). The fix for that bug makes download dialogs and
Javascript prompt/alert/confirm dialogs focus the tab that spawned them.
I think this behaviour should apply to HTTP authentication dialogs as well.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open testcase
2. Open the website of your bank in another tab
3. Wait 5 seconds
Expected result:
The tab containing the testcase should be focused before an HTTP authentication
dialog is opened.
Actual result:
An HTTP authentication dialog is opened while the tab showing the bank website
has focus. This gives the impressions that the bank website spawned the dialog.

This makes nsPrompt do what nsGlobalWindow does when opening modal dialogs, but
only for PromptUsernameAndPassword(). We should make this more mainstream and
probably move the almost identical code from nsGlobalWindow into nsPrompt too,
but I don't want to do that on the branches...

Focus tab that's opening an auth dialog.
Why are you only calling DispatchCustomEvent from PromptUsernameAndPassword?
What about PromptPassword and the other nsIAuthPrompt and nsIPrompt methods?

|  | |

Why not the same for promptPassword() and select() ? Don't they have the same issue?
The older fix was in nsGlobalWindow.cpp, but it looks like that ultimately calls
down to the windowwatcher prompt as well. Should all of the event creation be
moved to the same place?
if nsPrompt calls nsPromptService to do the work, why is this not in the lowest
level? Does that catch too many unintended dialogs or something?

Johnny says we should leave the GlobalWindow stuff for the branch (if it ain't
broke...), but can move them later. I buy that

This does the same thing for PasswordPrompt(), and yes, eventually we'll want
to move all this cothe code that currently does in for the DOM methods into the
nsPrompot code, but I don't want to do that now for the branches. That's trunk
kind of changes IMO.

Same thing for PasswordPrompt().
This looks good. Couple things that might be good for the trunk:
1) remove the code that gets a auth prompt from the tree owner since we'll
always have a windowwatcher, and that is the canonical way to get a prompt.
2) move all of the DOM event generation into nsPromptService (for window.alert,
etc.)

tested with 2005021806-1.0.1 firefox builds on Mac 10.3.8 and Win XP, and this
looks fixed: after I open another tab to a banking site, the previous tab
test-http-auth site properly grabs focus when its login prompt appears.
verified fixed for aviary 1.0.1.

During docshell destruction, and of course if we're out of memory and we get
here before we've created the script environment.

"DOMWillOpenModalDialog" is hadled by tabbrowser.xml in mozilla 1.4.
But there is no handler for "DOMModalDialogClosed".
Also for mozilla, both in trunk and mozilla 1.7 "DOMModalDialogClosed" was not
been handled.
This event is handled only in toolkit/content/widgets/tabbrowser.xml, which is
in aviary tree.

The event is only there to support a setTimeout hack which was checked in by

# Mozilla Firefox: Various vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-10**

Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to a local file deletion issue and to various
issues allowing to trick the user into trusting fake web sites or
interacting with privileged content.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is the popular next-generation browser from the
Mozilla project.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla
Firefox:

* Michael Krax reported that plugins can be used
  to load privileged content and trick the user to interact with it
  (CAN-2005-0232, CAN-2005-0527)
* Michael Krax also reported
  potential spoofing or cross-site-scripting issues through overlapping
  windows, image drag-and-drop, and by dropping javascript: links on tabs
  (CAN-2005-0230, CAN-2005-0231, CAN-2005-0591)
* Daniel de Wildt
  and Gael Delalleau discovered a memory overwrite in a string library
  (CAN-2005-0255)
* Wind Li discovered a possible heap overflow in
  UTF8 to Unicode conversion (CAN-2005-0592)
* Eric Johanson
  reported that Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) features allow
  homograph attacks (CAN-2005-0233)
* Mook, Doug Turner, Kohei
  Yoshino and M. Deaudelin reported various ways of spoofing the SSL
  "secure site" indicator (CAN-2005-0593)
* Matt Brubeck reported
  a possible Autocomplete data leak (CAN-2005-0589)
* Georgi
  Guninski discovered that XSLT can include stylesheets from arbitrary
  hosts (CAN-2005-0588)
* Secunia discovered a way of injecting
  content into a popup opened by another website (CAN-2004-1156)
* Phil Ringnalda reported a possible way to spoof Install source with
  user:pass@host (CAN-2005-0590)
* Jakob Balle from Secunia
  discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download dialog source
  (CAN-2005-0585)
* Christian Schmidt reported a potential
  spoofing issue in HTTP auth prompt tab (CAN-2005-0584)
* Andreas
  Sanblad from Secunia discovered a possible way of spoofing the Download
  dialog using the Content-Disposition header (CAN-2005-0586)
* Finally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
  discovered that Firefox insecurely creates temporary filenames in
  /tmp/plugtmp (CAN-2005-0578)

### Impact

* By setting up malicious websites and convincing users to
  follow untrusted links or obey very specific drag-and-drop or download
  instructions, attackers may leverage the various spoofing issues to
  fake other websites to get access to confidential information, push
  users to download malicious files or make them interact with their
  browser preferences.
* The temporary directory issue allows
  local attackers to overwrite arbitrary files with the rights of another
  local user.
* The overflow issues, while not thought to be
  exploitable, may allow a malicious downloaded page to execute arbitrary
  code with the rights of the user viewing the page.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.1"
```

All Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.1"
```

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-24

## HTTP auth prompt tab spoofing

Announced
February 24, 2005
Reporter
Christian Schmidt
Risk
Low
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.1
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.6

### Description

The HTTP authentication prompt appears above the currently open tab
regardless of which tab triggered it. A spoofer who could get a user
to open a high value target in another tab might be able to capture the
user's ID and password. HTTP auth dialogs are visually distinct from the
web form logins used by most commercial sites, and the HTTP auth dialog
clearly states which host it's for. Exploitation of this seems unlikely.

### Workaround

Do not browse trusted and untrusted sites in the same session. When
presented with a site login dialog double-check that it is for the
site you think it's for.
