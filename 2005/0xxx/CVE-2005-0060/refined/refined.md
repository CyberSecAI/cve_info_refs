Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An unchecked buffer exists in the way Windows processes certain types of fonts. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the affected operating system versions not properly validating the length of a message before passing it to an allocated buffer when handling fonts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the Windows kernel when processing malicious font data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows a logged-on user to escalate their privileges, gaining complete control of the affected system.
- **Full System Control:** An attacker can install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Potential Denial of Service:** On Windows XP Service Pack 2 systems, exploitation attempts are likely to result in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the target system.
- **Malicious Application:** The attack involves running a specially crafted application that exploits the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code, specifically a malicious application designed to exploit the font processing vulnerability.
- **No Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
