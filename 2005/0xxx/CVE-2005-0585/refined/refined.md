Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2005-0585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the Mozilla Suite and Firefox handle the display of the download dialog source. Specifically, the true source of a download can be disguised by using a hostname long enough that the most significant parts are truncated in the dialog. This can be further exploited on Windows by using non-breaking space characters in the subdomain labels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Spoofing: The primary vulnerability is the ability to spoof the displayed source of a download. The application fails to correctly and reliably represent the actual origin of the downloaded file, which can mislead the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Users may be tricked into downloading files from untrusted sources, believing they are from legitimate or trusted websites. This could lead to the installation of malware or other malicious content, or the downloading of files that have been tampered with.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves tricking the user into initiating a download from a malicious site. This is typically done by setting up a website with a long and potentially deceptive hostname.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a file on a server they control and manipulate the hostname of that server to make it appear as though the file is coming from a different, more trustworthy source.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to initiate the download by clicking a link to the malicious file, often embedded within a webpage, an email, or other communication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as a "low risk" and "low impact" issue by Mozilla.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 1.0.1 and Mozilla Suite 1.7.6.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jakob Balle of Secunia.

In summary, CVE-2005-0585 is a spoofing vulnerability that could trick users into downloading content from malicious sources by disguising the origin of the download in the download dialog.
