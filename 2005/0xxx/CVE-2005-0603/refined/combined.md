How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi everyone,

phpBB Group announces the release of phpBB 2.0.13, the "Beware of the furries" edition. This release addresses two recent security exploits, one of them critical. They were reported a few days after .12 was released and no one is more annoyed than us, having to release a new version in such a short period of time.

Fortunately both fixes are easy and in each case just one line needs to be edited.

The first issue is critical (session handling allowing everyone gaining administrator rights) and we urge you to fix it on your forums as soon as possible:

Open includes/sessions.php

Find:

Code: Select all

```
if( $sessiondata['autologinid'] == $auto_login_key )
```

Replace with:

Code: Select all

```
if( $sessiondata['autologinid'] === $auto_login_key )
```

A second minor issue reported to bugtraq several days ago was the path disclosure bug in viewtopic.php which got fixed by applying the following steps:

Open viewtopic.php

Find:

Code: Select all

```
$message = str_replace('\"', '"', substr(preg_replace('#(\>(((?>([^><]+|(?R)))*)\<))#se', "preg_replace('#\b(" . $highlight_match . ")\b#i', '<span style=\"color:#" . $theme['fontcolor3'] . "\"><b>\\\\1</b></span>', '\\0')", '>' . $message . '<'), 1, -1));
```

Replace with:

Code: Select all

```
$message = str_replace('\"', '"', substr(@preg_replace('#(\>(((?>([^><]+|(?R)))*)\<))#se', "@preg_replace('#\b(" . $highlight_match . ")\b#i', '<span style=\"color:#" . $theme['fontcolor3'] . "\"><b>\\\\1</b></span>', '\\0')", '>' . $message . '<'), 1, -1));

```

As with all new releases we urge you to upgrade as soon as possible. You can of course find this download available on our [downloads page](http://www.phpbb.com/downloads.php). As per usual three packages are available to simplify your upgrade.

phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=6&highlight=\[HaCkZaTaN]

It'll come out something like this.

Warning: Compilation failed: missing terminating ] for
character class at offset 20 in /home/nst/forum/viewtopic.php(1110) :
regexp code on line 1

It'll give a full path disclosure and also one thing that i noticed is
that the posts change it doesn't come out nothing.
In the HighLight Variable

Here is the problem:
-----[ Start Vuln Code ] ------------------------------------

1106: if ($highlight_match)
1107: {
1108: // This was shamelessly 'borrowed' from volker at multiartstudio dot de
1109: // via php.net's annotated manual
1110: $message = str_replace('\"', '"', \
substr(preg_replace('#(\>(((?>([^><]+|(?R)))*)\<))#se', "preg_replace('#\b(" . \
$highlight_match . ")\b#i', '<span style=\"color:#" . $theme['fontcolor3'] . \
                "\"><b>\\\\1</b></span>', '\\0')", '>' . $message . '<'), 1, -1));
1111: }

-----[ Ends Vulns Code ] ------------------------------------
Don't borrow stuff lol.

- Exploit
---------------------------------------------------------
Not Yet xD

- Solutions
--------------------------------------------------------
Not Yet xD

OK other thing that i noticed was in php.ini

magic_quotes_gpc = On
magic_quotes_sybase = Off

you have to turn both of them ON
