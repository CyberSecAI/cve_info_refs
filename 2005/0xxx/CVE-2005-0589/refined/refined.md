Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-0589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Mozilla Firefox's autocomplete feature interacts with user input while navigating through the autocomplete dropdown using the keyboard. When a user presses the down arrow key to scroll through autocomplete suggestions, the browser was prematurely updating the input field's value with each suggestion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Autocomplete Data Leak:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of autocomplete data. By monitoring the input field, malicious websites could steal previously entered data as the user navigates through autocomplete suggestions using the down arrow key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive data such as phone numbers, Social Security Numbers (SSNs), or other personal information that users have previously entered into forms and which are stored by the browser's autocomplete feature.
*   **Privacy Violation:** This vulnerability results in a privacy breach, allowing malicious websites to access a user's stored information without their explicit consent or knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker would need to create a malicious webpage containing an input field with a common name or a name that would attract the user's attention.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must interact with the form and use the down arrow key to scroll through the autocomplete suggestions. The user would need to have form autocomplete enabled in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server/Hosting:** The attacker would need to host a malicious webpage to trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker might need to use tricks or social engineering to convince the user to interact with the form and the autocomplete feature on their webpage.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the `nsAutoCompleteController::CompleteValue` function updates the input field's value too early when scrolling through the autocomplete list.
*   The fix involves modifying the browser so that the input field's value is not updated until the user explicitly selects an item from the list with "Enter". This change ensures that the values are not populated as the user navigates the autocomplete menu with the arrow keys, thus preventing the leak. A new attribute called `completeSelectedIndex` was added to `autocomplete.xml` to preserve URL bar behavior.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The bug report mentions that Internet Explorer does not populate the form field until enter is pressed, and this is the intended behavior.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 1.0.1.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Matt Brubeck.
