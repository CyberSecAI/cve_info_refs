- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `comment.php` script in paNews version 2.0b4 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `showpost` parameter, before displaying it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can create a malicious URI link containing hostile HTML and script code. If a victim user clicks the link, the injected code executes within the security context of the affected website. This can lead to the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes the harmful payload in the `showpost` parameter, such as `<http://www.example.com/comments.php?op=view&newsid=1&showpost=>"><h1>AttackerXSSvulnerable<!--`. The attacker then needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious code and convince a user to click on that link. No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
