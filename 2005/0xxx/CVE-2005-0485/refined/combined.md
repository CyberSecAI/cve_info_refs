Bug Number: 06

paNews
is a news management script to use on your site. Users can use paCode, special code \
designed to allow the adding of images and font changes in the posts without allowing \
users to use HTML to post harmful things such as Java scripts and applets. It has \
several other features making adding entries and controlling it easily. More info @:

Discussion:
--------------------
XSS Vulnerability in 'comment.php' that may allow a remote user to launch cross-site \
scripting attacks.

This issue could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link that \
includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were to be followed, the hostile \
code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the \
security context of the affected Web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based \
authentication credentials or other attacks.

also be affected.
