{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a case-sensitive check on file extensions during the upload process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Input validation flaw",
       "Case-sensitive file extension check"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the HTTPD process (typically the nobody user).",
    "attack_vectors": "Malicious file uploads.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to upload a file with a modified file extension that bypasses the case-sensitive check."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "GNUBoard 3.40 and prior"
  ],
   "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading files with extensions such as .PHP.rar, or .pHp.rar. The fix involves modifying the regular expression to be case-insensitive (e.g., changing `/\.php/` to `/\.php/i`)."
