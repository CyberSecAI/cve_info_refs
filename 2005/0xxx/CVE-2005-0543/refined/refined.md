Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied input in several phpMyAdmin scripts. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from:

1.  **Variable Injection:**  The application uses  `$cfg` and `GLOBALS` variables unsafely, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary values.
2.  **Path Disclosure:** Certain scripts, when called in unexpected ways, can trigger PHP error messages revealing the full installation path.
3.  **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Improper escaping of special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Attackers can include arbitrary files, potentially executing malicious code. This occurs due to the vulnerable use of `$GLOBALS['cfg']['ThemePath']` in `css/phpmyadmin.css.php` and `$cfg['Server']['extension']` in `libraries/database_interface.lib.php`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application when `register_globals` is enabled. This occurs through several parameters in `libraries/select_server.lib.php`, `libraries/display_tbl_links.lib.php` and theme files.
*   **Path Disclosure:** The application reveals the full path of the installation directory via PHP error messages.
*   **Improper escaping of special characters:** Which can lead to unintended privilege settings for MySQL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including and executing arbitrary PHP code via RFI, attackers can compromise the server.
*   **Data Exposure:** Path disclosure can help attackers in further attacks.
*   **Session Hijacking/Account Compromise:** XSS can potentially be used to hijack user sessions or compromise accounts.
*   **Privilege escalation:** Improper escaping of special characters could result in unintended privilege settings for MySQL.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** Attackers send crafted GET requests to vulnerable scripts, manipulating parameters such as `$GLOBALS[cfg][ThemePath]`, `$cfg[Server][extension]`, `strServer`, `bgcolor`, `row_no`, `left_font_family`, `right_font_family`, `doWriteModifyAt`, and others.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpMyAdmin installation.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable scripts and parameters that can be manipulated.
*   **PHP Configuration (for some vectors):** Certain XSS attacks are only possible when `register_globals` is enabled. Path disclosure is only possible if `display_errors` is enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `marc.info` content provides more detail on the specific vulnerable code snippets and parameters used in the attacks.
*   The `gentoo.org` content references multiple CVEs associated with this issue, including CVE-2005-0543, CVE-2005-0544 and CVE-2005-0653. This indicates that this is actually a set of related vulnerabilities.
*   The `phpmyadmin.net` content refers to this specific issue as PMASA-2005-2.

The provided information clearly relates to CVE-2005-0543, as it describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting phpMyAdmin that can lead to code execution, XSS, and path disclosure.
