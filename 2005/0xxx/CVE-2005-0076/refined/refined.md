Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Buffer overflows in the XView library.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist within the XView library.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** If a program linked against the vulnerable XView library is setuid root, a malicious user could potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation by a malicious user.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system. They must be able to execute a program that is linked against the vulnerable xview library and has setuid root permissions.

The provided content gives more detail than the CVE description by explicitly stating that multiple buffer overflows are present, clarifies that exploitation is possible if the vulnerable program is setuid root, and specifies that the attack is local.
