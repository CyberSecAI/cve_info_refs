Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-0247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by multiple buffer overflows in the PL/PgSQL parser of PostgreSQL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflows:**  The core issue is the presence of several buffer overflows within the PL/PgSQL parser. These overflows occur when the parser attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of these buffer overflows can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server. This code would run with the privileges of the user running the PostgreSQL database server.
- **Server Crash:** If arbitrary code execution is not achieved, the overflows can still lead to the PostgreSQL server crashing due to memory corruption.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A crash can lead to a denial of service, making the database unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Queries:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted malicious SQL queries to the PostgreSQL server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Database User Access:** The attacker needs to be a valid database user to be able to send queries to the server.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to connect to the PostgreSQL server. This could be from a local network or remote if the server is exposed.

**Additional Notes:**
