| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c0)  Victor Ashik    2005-01-19 12:15:08 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041111 Firefox/1.0  Description of problem: Scrolling of hdlist2 causes less to segfault.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): less-378-11  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Mount any RHEL3 CD1 on /mnt/cdrom and do 2. less -f /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/base/hdlist2 3. Press and hold spacebar.  Actual Results:  It will cause a segmentation fault.   Expected Results:  Scrolling till the end of file.  Additional info:  I think it is the failed assertion in first line of buffering_multi.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c1)  Suzanne Hillman    2005-01-19 22:34:38 UTC  ``` Why are you trying to run less on a binary file?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c2)  Victor Ashik    2005-01-20 11:24:46 UTC  ``` Because I like it ;-)  It may be a security problem, because after some digging with debugger it looks like a buffer overflow.  Vulnerable pager is a very, very bad thing. I am sorry for not giving it SECURITY flag yesterday. Giving it now. Please, fix it.  Hint1: buffer overflows in a UTF-8 locale on a line of 0x81 bytes longer than 1028. Hint2: overflow seems to overwrite MULBUF* mp in multi.c   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c3)  Victor Ashik    2005-01-20 14:12:38 UTC  ``` Update: in en_US.UTF-8 locale Hint1 requires more than 1035 bytes.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c4)  Victor Ashik    2005-01-20 14:14:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 110010](attachment.cgi?id=110010 "Binary file consists of 1036 '\0x81' chars - testcase for less segfault") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=110010&action=edit "Binary file consists of 1036 '\0x81' chars - testcase for less segfault") Binary file consists of 1036 '\0x81' chars - testcase for less segfault   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c6)  Josh Bressers    2005-01-20 14:40:20 UTC  ``` This issue could be dangerous.  Ideally this issue would be best fixed in the next round of quarterly updates.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c8)  Victor Ashik    2005-01-21 11:39:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 110046](attachment.cgi?id=110046&action=diff "Expand charset[] buffer with expanding of other buffers") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=110046&action=edit "Expand charset[] buffer with expanding of other buffers") Expand charset[] buffer with expanding of other buffers  Found the error. We are expanding linebuf[] and attr[] buffers in expand_linebuf(), line.c:90, but forgetting to expand charset[] buffer.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c9)  Victor Ashik    2005-01-21 12:49:46 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 110046](attachment.cgi?id=110046&action=diff "Expand charset[] buffer with expanding of other buffers") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=110046&action=edit "Expand charset[] buffer with expanding of other buffers") Expand charset[] buffer with expanding of other buffers  The patch is not perfect.  calloc for charset should allocate sizeof(CHARSET) blocks and returned pointer sould be converted to (CHARSET*)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c10)  Victor Ashik    2005-01-21 12:52:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 110048](attachment.cgi?id=110048&action=diff "Corrected patch for expading charset[] buffer with expanding of other buffers") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=110048&action=edit "Corrected patch for expading charset[] buffer with expanding of other buffers") Corrected patch for expading charset[] buffer with expanding of other buffers  Corrected types in calloc line. Now it works.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c11)  Jindrich Novy    2005-01-24 10:18:51 UTC  ``` Victor, thanks for the patch. The fix is confirmed and patch is now added to CVS.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c12)  Victor Ashik    2005-01-24 10:24:29 UTC  ``` Thanks for a job well done.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c15)  Josh Bressers    2005-01-25 14:27:50 UTC  ``` I've done some investigating on this issue.  This problem is caused by a patch we apply to the RHEL3 less.  It does not affect the original version, or any upstream versions I've tried.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=145527#c16)  Josh Bressers    2005-01-26 15:40:20 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-068.html>    ``` |  |

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
