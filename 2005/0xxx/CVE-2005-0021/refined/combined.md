Package        : exim-tls
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0021
Debian Bug     : 289046

Philip Hazel announced a buffer overflow in the host_aton function in
exim-tls, the SSL-enabled version of the default mail-tranport-agent
in Debian, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code via an
illegal IPv6 address.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.35-3woody3.

In the unstable distribution (sid) this package does not exist
anymore.

We recommend that you upgrade your exim-tls package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Exim: Two buffer overflows — GLSA **200501-23**

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities, which could lead to arbitrary code
execution, have been found in the handling of IPv6 addresses as well as in
the SPA authentication mechanism in Exim.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-mta/exim** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.43-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.43-r2** |

### Background

Exim is an highly configurable message transfer agent (MTA)
developed at the University of Cambridge.

### Description

Buffer overflows have been found in the host\_aton() function
(CAN-2005-0021) as well as in the spa\_base64\_to\_bits() function
(CAN-2005-0022), which is part of the SPA authentication code.

### Impact

A local attacker could trigger the buffer overflow in host\_aton()
by supplying an illegal IPv6 address with more than 8 components, using
a command line option. The second vulnerability could be remotely
exploited during SPA authentication, if it is enabled on the server.
Both buffer overflows can potentially lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Exim users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-mta/exim-4.43-r2"
```
