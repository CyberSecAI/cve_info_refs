Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in PhotoPost PHP 5.0 RC3 and later versions:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Reliance on `magic_quotes_gpc`:** PhotoPost relies on the PHP `magic_quotes_gpc` setting for input data filtering, which is not reliable and often disabled. This leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Insufficient or inconsistent input validation and sanitization, particularly for user-supplied data used in database queries.
*   **Missing Access Controls:** Certain scripts and functions that should be restricted to administrators are accessible to all users due to missing access controls.
*   **Inadequate checks for email sending**: Lack of rate limiting and user authorization checks in email-sending functions which enables spamming.
*   **Insufficient HTML/JS sanitization**: Improper filtering of HTML and JavaScript in user-supplied content, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **File upload vulnerabilities**: No content verification of uploaded files, leading to arbitrary file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Unescaped user-supplied data is directly used in SQL queries, allowing attackers to extract arbitrary data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords). This occurs due to the failure to use functions like `mysql_escape_string` or `mysql_real_escape_string` when magic quotes is disabled.
    * The specific example provided involves using a `UNION SELECT` statement in the `uid` parameter of `member.php` to retrieve data.
    *The query `SELECT joindate,email,username FROM {$Globals['pp_db_prefix']}users WHERE userid=$uid` is vulnerable since $uid is directly supplied by the user and is not sanitized

*   **Email Spam:**
    *   Lack of authorization checks and rate-limiting mechanisms on email sending functions allow unauthenticated users to send arbitrary amounts of emails, potentially spamming the administrator's mailbox. The `reportpost` action in `misc.php` is vulnerable to this.

*   **Session Stealing via XSS:**
    *   The `editbio` field in user profiles does not sanitize user input allowing arbitrary HTML and JavaScript which can be exploited to steal user sessions or perform other malicious actions when the profile is viewed.
    * The function `check_tags` has a weak regular expression to filter HTML tags, with only a check for `javascript:`, which can be easily bypassed, allowing for XSS.

*   **Image Manipulation:**
    *   The `adm-photo.php` script lacks proper access control and allows unauthorized users to access administrative functionalities such as rebuilding image thumbnails and rotating images.

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   The system allows arbitrary files to be uploaded by disguising them as image files since no validation on file content is performed. This allows attackers to upload malicious files, including JavaScript, which can then be executed in user browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data in the database (user credentials, etc.)
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can spam the administrator's mailbox leading to service disruption and potentially overloading email servers.
*   **Account Hijacking/Session Stealing:** XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to steal user sessions, impersonate users, and take over accounts.
*   **Website Defacement/Malicious Activity:**  Unrestricted file uploads can be used to inject malicious scripts, deface the website, or carry out other malicious activities.
*   **Unauthorized Content Manipulation:**  Manipulating photos may lead to data integrity issues and user distrust.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through specially crafted HTTP requests, targeting vulnerable PHP scripts.
    *   SQL injection attacks via `member.php?ppaction=rpwd`
    *   Spamming via `misc.php?action=reportpost`
    *   Image manipulation via `adm-photo.php`
*   **Uploaded Files:** Attackers can upload malicious files to the server through the image upload functionality.
*   **User Profile Manipulation:** Attackers can inject malicious code into user profiles to perform XSS attacks when other users view the profile.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely over the network through a web browser.
*   **No Authentication (for some vulnerabilities):** Several of the vulnerabilities (SQL injection, email spam, image manipulation) can be exploited without prior authentication. XSS vulnerabilities may require user interaction.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability report notes that the vendor was informed but did not respond promptly.
*   A later version 5.01 addresses some of the issues described in the article, including the email bypass.
