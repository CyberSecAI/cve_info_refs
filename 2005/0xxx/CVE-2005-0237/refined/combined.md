How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

KDE Security Advisory: Konqueror International Domain Name Spoofing
Original Release Date: 20050316
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20050316-2.txt
0. References

1. Systems affected:
All KDE versions in the KDE 3.2.x and KDE 3.3.x series.
2. Overview:
Since version 3.2 KDE and it's webbrowser Konqueror have support
for International Domain Names (IDN). Unfortunately this has
made KDE vulnerable to a phishing technique known as a
Homograph attack.
IDN allows a website to use a wide range of international characters
in its domain name. Unfortunately some of these characters have a
strong resemblance to other characters, so called homographs. This
makes it possible for a website to use a domain name that is
technically different from another well known domain name, but has
no or very little visual differences.
This lack of visual difference can be abused by attackers to
trick users into visiting malicious websites that resemble
a well known and trusted website in order to obtain personal
information such as credit card details.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2005-0237 to this issue.
For KDE 3.4 KDE and the Konqueror webbrowser have adopted a
whitelist of domains for which IDN is safe to use because the
registrar for these domains has implemented anti-homographic
character policies or otherwise limited the available set of
characters to prevent spoofing.
3. Impact:
Users can be tricked into visiting a malicious website that
resembles a well known and trusted website without getting any
visual indication that this website differs from the one the
user was expecting to visit.
4. Solution:
Upgrade to KDE 3.4.
For older versions of KDE Source code patches have been made
available which fix these vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor /
binary package provider for information about how to obtain updated
binary packages.
5. Patch:
A patch for KDE 3.2.x is available from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security\_patches
611bad3cb9ae46ac35b907c7321da7aa post-3.2.3-kdelibs-idn.patch
