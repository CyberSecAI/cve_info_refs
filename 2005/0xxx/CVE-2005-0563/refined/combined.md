How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**I am still using Exchange 2000 Service Pack 3. What should I do?**

It should be a priority for customers who have this version to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. The Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server Post-Service Pack 3 (SP3) Update Rollup released on August 2004 is a prerequisite for support on Exchange 2000. The build number is 6603.1. This Update Rollup is a prerequisite for all Exchange 2000 Server updates that are released after June 29, 2004 and that have a build number that is greater than 6603. For more information about the Exchange Service Pack Product Lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifesupsps). For more information about the Exchange Product Lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742)

**Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4 is on Windows NT 4.0 which has reached the end of its life cycle. What should I do?**

Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a has reached the end of its life cycle. Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4 customers should make sure that they are using Windows 2000 Server. If you are still using Windows NT Server 4.0 you should upgrade as soon as possible\*\*.\*\*

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

**Note** Outlook Web Access for Exchange 5.5 can be installed on an Exchange server or as a standalone IIS application that links to an installation of Exchange on a different server\*\*.\*\*

MBSA will determine whether this update is required for an Exchange 5.5 server with Outlook Web Access installed. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

MBSA does not support Outlook Web Access when running on a standalone Internet Information Server (IIS) and will not detect whether the update is required in this case. However, Microsoft has developed a version of the [Enterprise Update Scanning Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) (EST) that will help customers determine if the security update is required in this case.

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158). The Security Update Inventory Tool is required for detecting Microsoft Windows and other affected Microsoft products. For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460)

For more information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

You can deploy this update by using the [Inventory and Software Distribution](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33333) feature of SMS.

**Impact of workaround:**

E-mail that is formatted in HTML will not display correctly. Users will see the raw HTML behind the e-mail.

**Disable Outlook Web Access for each Exchange site**

To disable Outlook Web Access follow these steps.

**Note** These steps must be performed on each Exchange site.

1. Start Exchange Administrator.
2. Expand the **Configuration** container for the site.
3. Select the **Protocols** container for the site.
4. Open the properties of the **HTTP (Web) Site Settings** object.
5. Clear the **"Enable Protocol"** checkbox.
6. Wait for the change to replicate, and then verify the change has replicated to each server in the site. To do this, bind to each server in the site by using Exchange Administrator, and then view the **âEnabled Protocolâ** check box setting.

**Impact of Workaround:** Users will have no access to their mailboxes through Outlook Web Access.

**Uninstall Outlook Web Access.**

#### FAQ for Exchange Server Outlook Web Access Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0563:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that could allow an attacker to convince a user to run a malicious script. If this malicious script is run, it would execute in the security context of the user. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction.

The script could take any action on the user's computer that the Web site is authorized to take; this could include monitoring the Web session and forwarding information to a third party, running other code on the user's system and reading or writing cookies.

**What is Outlook Web Access?**

Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) is a service of Exchange Server. By using OWA, a server that is running Exchange Server can also function as a Web site that lets authorized users read and send mail, manage their calendar, and perform other mail functions over the Internet.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is caused by the way that Outlook Web Access (OWA) performs HTML encoding in the Compose New Message form.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

[Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/security/news/crssite.mspx) is a security vulnerability that could enable an attacker to "inject" code into a user's session with a Web site. Unlike most security vulnerabilities, XSS does not apply to any single vendor's products - instead, it can affect any software that generates HTML and that does not follow defensive programming practices.

**How does cross-site scripting work?**

Web pages contain text and HTML markup. Text and HTML markup are generated by the server and are interpreted by the client. Servers that generate static pages have full control over the way that the client interprets the pages that the server sends. However, servers that generate dynamic pages do not have control over the way that the client interprets the serversâ output. If untrusted content is introduced into a dynamic page, neither the server nor the client has sufficient information to recognize that this action has occurred and to take protective measures.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message to a user. The user would then have to open the message by using Outlook Web Access. The message could then cause the affected system to run script in the context of the userâs Outlook Web Access session.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Client systems accessing an Exchange Server 5.5 through Outlook Web Access are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**Are all supported versions of Outlook Web Access vulnerable?**

No. The vulnerability affects only Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server 5.5.

**On which Exchange servers should I install the update?**

This update is intended only for servers that are running Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server 5.5. You do not have to install this update on servers that are not running Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server 5.5. However, we recommend that you install this security update on all other servers running Exchange 5.5 servers to help protect them if they are later designated as Outlook Web Access servers.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by making sure that OWA script arguments are encoded so that they cannot be unintentionally executed.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
