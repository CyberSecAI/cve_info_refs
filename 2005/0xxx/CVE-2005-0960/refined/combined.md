Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.5.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: BROKEN PACKAGE ON CD: May 4, 2004**  *macppc only*

  The powerpc autobook-1.3.tgz package found on CD2 has been found to be corrupt,
  and will not extract.
  A replacement package can be found on the ftp sites.

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: May 5, 2004**
      *All architectures*

    Pathname validation problems have been found in
    [cvs(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/cvs.1),
    allowing malicious clients to create files outside the repository, allowing
    malicious servers to overwrite files outside the local CVS tree on
    the client and allowing clients to check out files outside the CVS
    repository.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.5/common/002_cvs.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: May 5, 2004**
        *All architectures*

      Under load "recent model"
      [gdt(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/gdt.4)
      controllers will lock up.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.5/common/003_gdt.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: May 5, 2004**
          *All architectures*

        Restore the ability to negotiate tags/wide/sync with some SCSI controllers ( i.e.
        [siop(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/siop.4),
        [trm(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/trm.4),
        [iha(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/iha.4)
        ).

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.5/common/004_scsi.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: May 6, 2004**
            *All architectures*

          Reply to in-window SYN with a rate-limited ACK.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.5/common/005_tcp.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: May 13, 2004**
              *All architectures*

            Check for integer overflow in procfs. Use of procfs is not recommended.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.5/common/006_procfs.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: May 20, 2004**
                *All architectures*

              A heap overflow in the
              [cvs(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/cvs.1)
              server has been discovered that can be exploited by clients sending
              malformed requests, enabling these clients to run arbitrary code
              with the same privileges as the CVS server program.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.5/common/007_cvs2.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: May 26, 2004**
                  *All architectures*

                With the introduction of IPv6 code in
                [xdm(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/xdm.1),
                one test on the 'requestPort' resource was deleted by accident. This
                makes xdm create the chooser socket even if xdmcp is disabled in
                xdm-config, by setting requestPort to 0. See
                [XFree86
                bugzilla](http://bugs.xfree86.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1376) for details.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.5/common/008_xdm.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: May 30, 2004**
                    *All architectures*

                  A flaw in the Kerberos V
                  [kdc(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/kdc)
                  server could result in the administrator of a Kerberos realm having
                  the ability to impersonate any principal in any other realm which
                  has established a cross-realm trust with their realm. The flaw is due to
                  inadequate checking of the "transited" field in a Kerberos request. For
                  more details see [Heimdal's announcement](http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/advisory/2004-04-01/).

                  * **010: RELIABILITY FIX: June 9, 2004**
                      *All architectures*

                    A FIFO bug was introduced in OpenBSD 3.5 that occurs when a FIFO is opened in
                    non-blocking mode for writing when there are no processes reading the FIFO.
                    One program affected by this is the [qmail](https://cr.yp.to/qmail.html)
                    mail server which could go into an infinite loop and consume all CPU.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.5/common/010_fifofs.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: June 9, 2004**
                        *All architectures*

                      Multiple remote vulnerabilities have been found in the
                      [cvs(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.5/cvs.1)
                      server that allow an attacker to crash the server or possibly execute arbitrary
                      code with the same privileges as the CVS server program.

                            Under a certain network load the kernel can run out of stack space. This was
                            encountered in an environment using CARP on a VLAN interface. This issue initially
                            manifested itself as a FPU related crash on boot up.

                                        was not checking the shared secret used for replies sent by the radius server.
                                        This could allow an attacker to spoof a reply granting access to the
                                        attacker. Note that OpenBSD does not ship with radius authentication enabled.

                                          BIND contains a bug which results in BIND trying to contact nameservers via IPv6, even in
                                          cases where IPv6 connectivity is non-existent. This results in unnecessary timeouts and
                                          thus slow DNS queries.
