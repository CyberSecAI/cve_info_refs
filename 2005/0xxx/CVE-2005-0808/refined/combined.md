## Apache Tomcat fails to properly handle certain requests

#### Vulnerability Note VU#204710

Original Release Date: 2005-03-14 | Last Revised: 2007-05-16

---

### Overview

Apache Tomcat does not properly handle certain types of requests allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

### Description

| Apache Tomcat is an implementation of the Java Servlet and JavaServer Page (JSP) technologies. Tomcat uses the AJP12 protocol (on TCP 8007 by default) for Servlet/JSP communication. A flaw in Tomcat's implemetation of the AJP12 protocol may allow a remote attacker to cause Tomcat to stop processing requests. If a remote attacker sends Tomcat a specially crafted request, that attacker may be able to force Tomcat to stop processing all subsequent requests.  Please note that this vulnerability was reported in Tomcat version 3.x. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By sending Tomcat a specially crafted request, a remote attacker may be able to cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade Tomcat**Upgrading to Tomcat version 5.x will correct this issue. |

### [Apache](#JGEI-6A2LEF) Affected

Notified:  January 20, 2005  Updated: March 01, 2005

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The Apache Software Foundation acknowledge that Tomcat 3.x can be remotely caused to crash or shutdown by a connection sending the right sequence of bytes to the AP12 protcol port (TCP 8007 by default). Tomcat 3.x users are advised to ensure that this port is adequately firewalled to ensure that it is not accessible to remote attackers. We do not plan on issuing updates to Tomcat 3.x for this issue.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

US-CERT has no additional comments at this time.

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.
