The provided content describes a vulnerability in Apache Tomcat's AJP12 protocol implementation, which is also present in Hitachi Cosminexus Server Component Container for Java.

**Root Cause:**
A flaw in the implementation of the AJP12 protocol within Apache Tomcat allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of certain requests within the AJP12 protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can send a specially crafted request that will cause Tomcat or affected application servers to stop processing all subsequent requests, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted request to the AJP12 protocol port (TCP 8007 by default).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the AJP12 port of the vulnerable server.
- Remote access is sufficient for exploitation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Apache Tomcat 3.x and Hitachi Cosminexus Server Component Container for Java versions 02-00 to 02-00-/L.
- A workaround suggested by Hitachi is to use IP filtering to restrict access to the AJP12 port and to avoid sending invalid data to this port via security tools.
- Apache does not plan to issue an update for Tomcat 3.x. The recommended fix is to upgrade to Tomcat 5.x or apply the fixed version provided by Hitachi.
