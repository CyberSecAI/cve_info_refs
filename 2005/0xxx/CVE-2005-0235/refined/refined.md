- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the way browsers handle Internationalized Domain Names (IDN), specifically the use of Punycode to represent Unicode characters. Attackers can exploit this by registering domain names that visually resemble legitimate ones using different character sets (homographs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core vulnerability is the ability to create visually similar domain names using different character sets (e.g., using Cyrillic characters that resemble Latin characters) which are then encoded into Punycode and displayed by browsers as the visually similar domain. This allows for URL spoofing.  Additionally, inconsistencies in how browsers match the hostname with the Common Name (CN) in SSL certificates, with some using the punycode and others the raw UTF-8, make it difficult to provide effective SSL services.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can conduct phishing attacks by creating spoofed URLs and SSL certificates, tricking users into believing they are interacting with legitimate websites. This can lead to the theft of sensitive information like passwords and financial details.
- **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs that use IDN homographs. Attackers register domain names that look like legitimate sites to trick users into visiting them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be able to register domain names using IDN characters, create websites mimicking legitimate ones, and, in some cases, obtain SSL certificates for these spoofed domains.
