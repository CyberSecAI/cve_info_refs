Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CubeCart 2.0.x as described in the context of CVE-2005-0606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is two-fold:
1.  **Path Disclosure:** Several PHP files in CubeCart 2.0.x were vulnerable to path disclosure. This was due to a lack of proper checks or sanitization, which would reveal the server's internal file paths when accessed directly.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `admin/settings.inc.php` file was vulnerable to XSS through unsanitized GET variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** Several files (`information.php`, `language.php`, `list_docs.php`, `popular_prod.php`, `sale.php`, `subfooter.inc.php`, `subheader.inc.php`, `cat_navi.php`, and `check_sum.php`) directly outputted file system paths when accessed directly, revealing sensitive information.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unsanitized GET variables in `admin/settings.inc.php` allowed for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** Attackers could gain valuable information about the server's file system structure, potentially aiding further attacks.
*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks, affecting administrators or users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** Direct access to the vulnerable PHP files via HTTP requests.
*   **XSS:** Crafting a malicious URL with injected JavaScript in the GET parameters, then tricking a user into accessing the URL, or incorporating such URL into a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server. No prior authentication or special privileges are required.
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a victim (admin) to load the crafted URL in their browser. This could be through social engineering or by injecting the malicious link somewhere that the admin would visit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The blog post by "Lostmon" identifies the specific files affected by path disclosure and the XSS vulnerability, and details a manual fix involving adding code to prevent direct execution and sanitize input, respectively.
* The CubeCart forum post confirms the release of version 2.0.6 to address these issues and provides the same fix instructions as Lostmon.
*  The Secunia content only mentions Secunia Research and its function as a source of vulnerability intelligence, and does not contain specific vulnerability information about this CVE, but the Secunia content does mention that they perform vulnerability research and also publish advisories.
