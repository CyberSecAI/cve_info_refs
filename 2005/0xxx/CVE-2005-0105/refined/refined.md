Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A format string vulnerability exists within the `typespeed` package.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a format string bug, which arises when user-controlled input is used as the format string in functions like `printf`. This allows the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `games` group.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack is local, meaning an attacker needs to have some level of access to the system to trigger the vulnerability in the `typespeed` program.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to run the `typespeed` application.

The advisory notes that the vulnerability was discovered by Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project. It also provides information on how to upgrade the package to the fixed version.
