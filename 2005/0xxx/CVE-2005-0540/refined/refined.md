The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Cyclades AlterPath Manager (APM) version 1.2.1, which are not related to a single CVE but rather three different OSVDB entries.  Given that, I will provide the information for each vulnerability separately:

**Vulnerability 1**
*   **Root cause:** The APM web interface discloses sensitive system information without authentication.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Information disclosure.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gather information about the system, including boot version, kernel version, config version, OS version, AP version, and hardware details. This information could be used to further exploit other vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack vectors:** Unauthenticated access to the `/about.html` webpage on the APM web interface.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the APM web interface.

**Vulnerability 2**
*   **Root cause:** The APM's console access control can be bypassed by directly specifying the console name in the `consoleConnect.jsp` URL.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Insufficient access control on console connections.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can gain access to consoles they are not permitted to view, potentially leading to further unauthorized access and actions on connected systems.
*   **Attack vectors:** Modification of the URL parameter `consolename` in `consoleConnect.jsp`
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user on the APM web interface.

**Vulnerability 3**
*   **Root cause:** The `saveUser.do` functionality does not validate user privileges before granting administrative rights.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Privilege escalation due to missing privilege checks.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Any authenticated APM user can grant themselves administrative privileges.
*   **Attack vectors:** Modifying the `adminUser` parameter in the `saveUser.do` URL to "true".
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user on the APM web interface.
