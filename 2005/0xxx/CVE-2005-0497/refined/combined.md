Adp Elite system is an invoice/purchase order suite very common in car dealerships. \
It's a telnet based system. When a user logs in via telnet, adp dumps the user into \
the program where the user can check on a vehicle's status, generate PO's and RO's, \
etc.... The program is rather large and runs on a linux based system. Usually ftp is \
running as well. A user with a valid login name/pass... eh...cough...ettercap...cough \
is able to upload/download things into/from their directory... usually something like \
/adp/home/<user>.... by default there is a .profile containing this little gem...

# ADPROOT is equivalent to REALROOT on CoRA systems
ADPROOT=${ADPROOT:="/adp"}
export ADPROOT

download it... modify it to

# ADPROOT is equivalent to REALROOT on CoRA systems
ADPROOT=${ADPROOT:="/"}
export ADPROOT

then upload it...

now login via telnet... and bingo now you have a $hell

fix: chown root:root .profile
