Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2005-0739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow located within the IAPP dissector of Ethereal (now Wireshark).
*   The `dissect_pdus()` function calculates a length value from two `guint8` variables (pdu_len_h and pdu_len_l). This length can be up to 65535.
*   This length value is then used in loops within functions like `pduval_to_str()` to copy data into a static buffer named `textbuffer[2000]`. If the length from the packet exceeds the size of the buffer, a buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow. The code does not validate that the length derived from the network packet data is within the bounds of the buffer.
*   **Unvalidated Length Input:** The length of the data being copied is directly derived from the packet data without any checks to see if it exceeds the size of the destination buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted packet can cause Ethereal to crash due to the buffer overflow.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** While not fully investigated, there is a possibility of achieving remote code execution depending on the memory layout after the buffer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Packets:** The vulnerability is triggered by receiving specially crafted IAPP packets.
*   **Remote Attack:**  Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending malicious packets to systems running vulnerable versions of Ethereal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a system running Ethereal.
*   **Crafted Packet:** The attacker needs to craft IAPP packets with specific length values that exceed the size of the `textbuffer` array.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable code is in `packet-iapp.c`.
*   The vulnerability affects all Ethereal versions after the IAPP dissector was added up to version 0.10.9.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit exists.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Ethereal version 0.10.10.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA 718-1 also covers this vulnerability for Debian users.
*   Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 200503-16 also addresses this issue, along with other vulnerabilities in Ethereal.
