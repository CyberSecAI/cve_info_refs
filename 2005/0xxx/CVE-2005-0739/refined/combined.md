Debian Security Advisory DSA 718-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : ethereal
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0739

A buffer overflow has been detected in the IAPP dissector of Ethereal,
a commonly used network traffic analyser.  A remote attacker may be
able to overflow a buffer using a specially crafted packet.  More
problems have been discovered which don't apply to the version in
woody but are fixed in sid as well.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody12.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Advisory ID		:  LSS-2005-03-05
Date			:  2005-03-10
Advisory URL:		:  <http://security.lss.hr/index.php?page=details&ID=LSS-2005-03-05>
Impact			:  DoS and maybe possible code execution
Risk level		:  Medium
Vulnerability type	:  Remote
Vendors contacted	:  10th March, 2005

---

===[ Overview

Ethereal is an application used by network professionals for troubleshooting,
analysis and education, as well as the software and protocol development.
Ethereal provides all the features that protocol analyzer should have.
Moreover, there are several extra features which other products do not support.
The license is open source, what allows networking community experts to add
enhancements. Ethereal also supports different platforms, including Unix, Linux,
and Windows.

===[ Vulnerability

We have discovered another vulnerability in one of Ethereal dissectors. This time
problem is in IAPP dissector. It is possible to overflow static buffer with
length value taken from network packet. Vulnerability itself is in dissect_pdus()
function.
Length is calculated from two guint8 variables in which first one is shifted to
left, and second is added to it, so it can be up to 65535. That length is later
used in loops that can be abused to overflow static buffer 'textbuffer[2000]'.

packet-iapp.c
-------------
static void
dissect_pdus(tvbuff_t *tvb, int offset, proto_tree *pdutree, int pdulen)
{
 ...
 int len;
 ...
 tvb_memcpy(tvb, (guint8 *)&pduhdr, offset, sizeof(e_pduhdr));
 len = (((int)pduhdr.pdu_len_h) << 8) + pduhdr.pdu_len_l;
 ...
}
-------------

Vulnerable loop example in packet-iapp.c:
-----------------
pduval_to_str(int type, int len, tvbuff_t *tvb, int offset)
{
...
     case IAPP_PDU_MSADDR:
     mac = tvb_get_ptr(tvb, offset + 3, len);
     for (z = 0; z < len; z++)
         run += sprintf(run, "%s%02x", z ? ":" : "", mac[z]);
             break;
...
}
----------------

Remote code execution depends on overflowed buffer environment, and maybe it
could be possible, but wasn't further investigated.

===[ Affected versions

All versions after IAPP dissector was added to CVS, including version 0.10.9.
PoC exploit for this vulnerability was tested with Ethereal 0.10.9 on Windows,
and Ethereal developer Guy Harris tested it on OS X.

===[ Fix

This vulnerability is fixed in latest Ethereal version 0.10.10, and can be
downloaded from <http://www.ethereal.com/download.html>.

===[ PoC Exploit

# Ethereal: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal, which may allow an attacker to
run arbitrary code or crash the program.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/ethereal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.10** |

### Background

Ethereal is a feature rich network protocol analyzer.

### Description

There are multiple vulnerabilities in versions of Ethereal earlier than
0.10.10, including:

* The Etheric, 3GPP2 A11 and IAPP dissectors are vulnerable to buffer
  overflows (CAN-2005-0704, CAN-2005-0699 and CAN-2005-0739).
* The GPRS-LLC could crash when the "ignore cipher bit" option is
  enabled (CAN-2005-0705).
* Various vulnerabilities in JXTA and sFlow dissectors.

### Impact

An attacker might be able to use these vulnerabilities to crash
Ethereal and execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running Ethereal, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

For a temporary workaround you can disable all affected protocol
dissectors. However, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade to the
latest stable version.

### Resolution

All Ethereal users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.10"
```

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
