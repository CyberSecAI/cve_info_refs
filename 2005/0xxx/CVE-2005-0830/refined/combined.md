# Xzabite dyndnsupdate: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200503-27**

Xzabite's dyndnsupdate software suffers from multiple vulnerabilities,
potentially resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/dyndnsupdate** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.6.15** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

dyndnsupdate is a dyndns.org data updater written by Fredrik "xzabite"
Haglund.

### Description

Toby Dickenson discovered that dyndnsupdate suffers from multiple
overflows.

### Impact

A remote attacker, posing as a dyndns.org server, could execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running dyndnsupdate.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Currently, there is no released version of dyndnsupdate that contains a
fix for these issues. The original xzabite.org distribution site is
dead, the code contains several other problems and more secure
alternatives exist, such as the net-dns/ddclient package. Therefore,
the dyndnsupdate package has been hard-masked prior to complete removal
from Portage, and current users are advised to unmerge the package:

```
 # emerge --unmerge net-misc/dyndnsupdate
```
### References

* [CVE-2005-0830](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0830)

**Release date**

March 21, 2005

**Latest revision**

| [Description](#c0)  Toby Dickenson    2005-03-09 13:00:00 UTC  ``` dyndnsupdate-0.6.15 has a remote vulnerability which appears to be exploitable. In src/dyndnsupdate.c, the ipcheck function fails to validate data read from a socket before copying it into 'ipaddress', a stack allocated buffer, using sprintf.  I guess that wont be the only problem... Most of this code is very naive. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Toby Dickenson    2005-03-13 05:02:09 UTC  ``` 1. I have been unable to contact upstream author; registrations of domains for contact email addresses have lapsed.  2. Googling suggests that no other distributions are including this package.  3. There is already a viable alternative to this package in portage; net-dns/ddclient   I suggest adding this package to package.mask, and removing it from portage.     ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-16 10:44:01 UTC  ``` Re-assigning to security. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-16 11:35:22 UTC  ``` Upstream is dead, package has no Gentoo maintainer...  Auditors, could you please confirm the package is a mess ? I have nfc how this works... Does the attacker need to setup a malicious server ? Or is dyndnsupdate a listening daemon ? In the latter we'll have to issue a GLSA about this if we dump it. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Toby Dickenson    2005-03-16 12:26:34 UTC  ``` It doesnt listen - exploiting this requires dns cache poisoning, tcp session hijacking, or control over an http proxy. There is no ssl here (unlike most other dyndns clients), so these attacks are not too demanding.  The ebuild doesnt run this program automatically, but I guess many users will be running this as root. *I* would want to receive a GLSA for this.   Access to the local filesystem looks safe; I dont see any local exploits.   ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-17 02:36:24 UTC  ``` Confirmed, it does look exploitable via multiple vectors. dns poisoning would be required though, so not a high priority.   I think it should be dropped in favour of the maintained package. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-17 02:41:55 UTC  ``` the problems start in the argument parsing and get worse from there. bin it.  nemo dyndnsupdate-0.6.15 # ./dyndnsupdate -a 127.0.0.1 \  -u $(perl -e 'print "x" x 1024') \  -h bleh -s $(perl -e 'print "x" x 1024') Segmentation fault  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-17 03:15:14 UTC  ``` OK. Upstream is dead, package is a mess, it has no maintainer and alternatives exist. Should be masked prior to removal, and a Masking GLSA should be issued to warn our users to switch to better alternatives. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-21 06:31:29 UTC  ``` Security please review the masking GLSa draft ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-03-21 07:58:08 UTC  ``` Masking GLSA 200503-27 Keeping open as enhancement to remember to remove it sometime ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Robert Paskowitz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-17 15:54:05 UTC  ``` Probably safe to remove this from the tree now. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-15 05:31:30 UTC  ``` Removed ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
