  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-0830",
      "root_cause": "The `ipcheck` function in `src/dyndnsupdate.c` does not validate data read from a socket before copying it into a stack-allocated buffer (`ipaddress`) using `sprintf`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient input validation before copying data into a fixed-size buffer with `sprintf`"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `dyndnsupdate`.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "DNS cache poisoning",
        "TCP session hijacking",
        "Control over an HTTP proxy"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the data being received by the dyndnsupdate client from a remote server. This could be achieved by DNS poisoning, TCP session hijacking, or man-in-the-middle attacks if HTTP proxy is used. No local exploits are apparent."

      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-0830",

        "Buffer overflow during argument parsing"
