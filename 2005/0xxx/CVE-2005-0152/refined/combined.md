How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : squirrelmail
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0104 CAN-2005-0152
Debian Bug     : 292714

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squirrelmail, a
commonly used webmail system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-0104

    Upstream developers noticed that an unsanitised variable could
    lead to cross site scripting.

CAN-2005-0152

    Grant Hollingworth discovered that under certain circumstances URL
    manipulation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with
    the privileges of www-data.  This problem only exists in version
    1.2.6 of Squirrelmail.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) the problem that affects unstable
has been fixed in version 1.4.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the

## SquirrelMail may allow execution of arbitrary code

#### Vulnerability Note VU#203214

Original Release Date: 2005-02-09 | Last Revised: 2005-02-09

---

### Overview

SquirrelMail 1.2.6 may allow remote execution of arbitrary code via URL manipulation.

### Description

| From the [SquirrelMail webpage](http://www.squirrelmail.org/):  SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4. It includes built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and all pages render in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across browsers. It has very few requirements and is very easy to configure and install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality you would want from an email client, including strong MIME support, address books, and folder manipulation.SquirrelMail 1.2.6 contains an input-handling flaw that may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote attackers could execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges as the SquirrelMail CGI user, typically www-data or similar. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Information for obtaining updates may be found in the "Vendor" section of this note. Users may also visit the [SquirrelMail web site](http://www.squirrelmail.org/) for additional information concerning updates.Note: SquirrelMail 1.2.6 is the only version affected and is from the previous stable release series. The current 1.4.x branch is not affected. |
