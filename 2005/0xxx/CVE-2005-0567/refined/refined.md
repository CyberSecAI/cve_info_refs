Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2005-0567:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The primary cause is a combination of variable injection and insufficient input validation within phpMyAdmin. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data before using it in file inclusion and string display operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**
   - Vulnerable files: `css/phpmyadmin.css.php` and `libraries/database_interface.lib.php`.
   - The `css/phpmyadmin.css.php` script uses a `$GLOBALS['cfg']['ThemePath']` variable to construct a file path for inclusion. By manipulating this variable through the URL, an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server or a remote location.
   - The `libraries/database_interface.lib.php` script constructs a file path based on the `cfg['Server']['extension']` parameter. By manipulating this parameter, the attacker can force the script to include an arbitrary file, although the file must have a `.dbi.lib.php` suffix.
   - Weakness: Unsanitized user-controlled input is used in file path construction, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary local or remote files.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
   - Vulnerable files: Several, including `libraries/select_server.lib.php`, `libraries/display_tbl_links.lib.php`, `themes/original/css/theme_left.css.php`, and `themes/original/css/theme_right.css.php`
   - When `register_globals` is enabled, several parameters can be manipulated via the URL to inject malicious Javascript into the application, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
    - Weakness: Failure to properly encode user-supplied data when displayed in the application, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution within a user's browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **RFI:**
    - An attacker could gain arbitrary code execution on the server by including a malicious PHP file. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server, data theft, or other malicious activities.
    - An attacker could read sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files or other private data.

2.  **XSS:**
    - An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the phpMyAdmin interface.
    - This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and other client-side attacks, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **RFI:** By crafting specific URLs with malicious values for the vulnerable parameters (e.g., `GLOBALS[cfg][ThemePath]`, `cfg[Server][extension]`).
-  **XSS:** By crafting specific URLs with malicious values for the parameters such as `cfg[Servers][cXIb8O3]`, `strServer`, `bgcolor`, `row_no` `left_font_family`, and `right_font_family` when register_globals is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance.
-   For RFI attacks, the attacker needs to identify a path to a malicious file, whether local on the server or available via a URL.
-   For XSS attacks, `register_globals` has to be enabled on the server where phpMyAdmin is running.

**Additional Information:**
-   The official phpMyAdmin advisory (PMASA-2005-1) confirms these vulnerabilities and recommends upgrading to phpMyAdmin 2.6.1-pl2 or later and to disable `register_globals`.
-   The vulnerabilities affect versions of phpMyAdmin down to 1.3.1 for XSS and the 2.6 branch for RFI.

In summary, CVE-2005-0567 describes a serious vulnerability in phpMyAdmin stemming from insecure handling of user input leading to both remote file inclusion and cross-site scripting attacks.
