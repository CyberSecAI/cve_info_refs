*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper bounds checking during DHTML method handling.
    *   Heap overflow vulnerability due to writing outside buffer boundaries.
*  **Impact:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running Internet Explorer. This could lead to complete control of the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious web pages: An attacker can craft a malicious web page designed to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   Malicious HTML emails: An attacker can send an email containing malicious HTML content designed to trigger this vulnerability, particularly if the user opens an attachment.
    * User interaction is required in both vectors.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to host or compromise a website to deliver the malicious code.
    *   The attacker must persuade the user to visit the malicious website or open an email containing the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as a remote code execution issue.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer.
*   The provided document indicates that this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the bulletin, but was reported to Microsoft through responsible disclosure by Andreas Sandblad of Secunia.
