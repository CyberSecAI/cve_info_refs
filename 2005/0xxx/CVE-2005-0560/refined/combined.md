How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Exchange Server contains unchecked buffer in SMTP extended verb handling

#### Vulnerability Note VU#275193

Original Release Date: 2005-04-12 | Last Revised: 2005-08-02

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in some versions of Microsoft's Exchange Server may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected server.

### Description

| Microsoft's Exchange Server supports a number of protocols for handling email, including the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and SMTP extended verbs as defined by [RFC2821](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt). A buffer overflow error exists in the way that Exchange Server 2003 and Exchange 2000 Server handle a particular, but unspecified SMTP extended verb. This error results in a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. According to Microsoft, this vulnerability could be exploited by:  On Exchange 2000, any anonymous user who could connect to an SMTP port on the Exchange Server and issue a specially crafted extended verb request.  On Exchange 2003, the level of authentication required to exploit this vulnerability is typically only granted to other Exchange Servers within the same organization. In this case, the attacker would have to connect to an SMTP port on the Exchange Server with the authority of another Exchange Server within the same organization and issue a specially crafted extended verb request.  **NOTE:** We are aware of publicly available exploit code for this vulnerability and have received reports of successful compromise of vulnerable systems. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote attackers may be able to cause a denial of service or execute code of their choosing on an affected system, depending on the version of Exchange Server being used. In the case of code execution, the code would be run with the privileges of the Exchange Server, typically Local System. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Microsoft has published [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-021](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-021.mspx) in response to this issue. Users are encouraged to review this bulletin and apply the patches it refers to. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  In addition to the patches referenced above, Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-021 also contains [workaround information](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-021.mspx#EBABUAA) to mitigate this issue.

## Vulnerability Details

### Exchange Server Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0560:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Exchange Server that that could allow an attacker to connect to the SMTP port on an Exchange server and issue a specially-crafted command that could result in a denial of service or allow an attacker to run malicious programs of their choice in the security context of the SMTP service.

#### Mitigating Factors for Exchange Server Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0560:

Exchange Server 2003 will not process commands of this type that originate from unauthenticated users. The level of authentication required to exploit this vulnerability is typically only granted to other Exchange Servers within the same organization.

Microsoft ISA Server 2000, or third-party products that relay and filter SMTP traffic before forwarding it to Exchange, could be used to prevent an attack over the Internet. Detailed instructions on how to help protect against an attack using ISA Server can be found at the [ISA Server Preventative Measures Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/isaserver/support/prevent/) by following the link âHelp Protect Against the Exchange Server Vulnerability for MS05-021 Trafficâ.

Customers who use ISA Server 2000 or ISA Server 2004 to publish Exchange SMTP services with the default SMTP publishing rules are at reduced risk from this attack over the Internet. The Workarounds section below discusses these ISA publishing rules.

#### Workarounds for Exchange Server Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0560:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Use SMTP protocol inspection to filter out SMTP protocol extensions.**

There are default ISA publishing rules for Exchange for filtering out any SMTP protocol extensions from traffic that passes the firewall. Other third-party products may offer similar functionality. More information on how to publish an Exchange server computer with ISA Server can be found by visiting the [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 311237](https://www.microsoft.com/desktop/www.support.microsoft.com/kbid%3D311237).

**Only accept authenticated SMTP sessions.**

If practical, accept only authenticated connections. Accepting connections only from trusted sources will prevent anonymous attackers from being able to exploit this issue.

To require SMTP authentication on an Exchange 2000 server:

1. Start Exchange System Manager.
2. Locate the server in the organization tree.
3. Expand the Protocols container for the server.
4. Expand the SMTP container.
5. For each SMTP virtual server:

* Open the properties and of the virtual server object.
* Click the Access properties page.
* Click the Authentication button.
* Clear the "Anonymous Access" checkbox.
* Click OK to accept the change.

**Impact of Workaround:**

Typically, inbound SMTP mail is accepted without requiring authentication from the sender. If you implement this workaround, you will be able to receive email only from senders who have been granted appropriate permissions in your system.

**Note** This workaround does not prevent a malicious authenticated user from exploiting this vulnerability. But it does protect you against attack by anonymous users.

**Use a firewall to block the port that SMTP uses.**

Use a firewall to block the port that SMTP uses. Typically, that is port 25.

**Impact of Workaround:**

This workaround should only be used as a last resort to help protect you from this vulnerability. This workaround may directly affect the ability to communicate with external parties by e-mail.

**Unregister xlsasink.dll and fallback to Active Directory for distribution of route information**.

This workaround is presented for those operating a single-server Exchange organization. In organizations with more than one server, this option can cause problems, including, but not limited to misrouted e-mail.

1. In the exchange installationâs bin directory, run regsvr32 /u xlsasink.dll.
2. If the default one hour interval for the Exchange servers to update routing information from AD is sufficient, you may skip to step 8. Otherwise continue with the following instructions, taken from the More Information section in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 842026](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=842026)
3. Run regedit.
4. Navigate to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RESvc\Parameters
5. Edit the ReloadOsInterval value. If it doesnât exist, create a new DWORD with that name.
6. Type in the number of seconds that the AD route information refresh interval should be. By default this is 3600.
7. Click **Ok** and close regedit
8. Restart all of the Exchange servers in the Routing Group at the same time.

**Impact of Workaround:**

Exchange Servers will not use SMTP to proactively update routing information. They will, however, continue to use Routing Engine port 691 within a Routing Group (RG). If changes to the mail infrastructure outside of the RG are made, the Exchange servers will not know about the new configuration until they refresh routing information from the Active Directory. If this process does not occur, or takes too long, it will result in an interruption of mail services. The only way for this process to occur is if Winroute shows a zero value for the major version of all remote routing groups (See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 842026](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=842026) for more information). For this reason, if you chose to implement this workaround, please contact Microsoft Product Support Services if you have more than one Exchange server in your organization. Information on how to contact Microsoft Product Support Services can be found at at this [Web site](https://support.microsoft.com).

**Note** This workaround should only be considered as a short term mitigation step to be used until the update can be applied. It is highly likely that over time message routing problems will arise by operating in this state. Please apply the security update as soon as possible and reverse all changes made.

#### FAQ for Exchange Server Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0560:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full system rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the SMTP service.

**What is SMTP?**

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry standard for delivering e-mail over the Internet, as defined in [RFC 2821](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt) and in [RFC 2822](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt). The protocol defines the format of e-mail messages, the fields that are in e-mail messages, the contents of e-mail messages, and the handling procedures for e-mail messages.

**What are SMTP extended verbs?**

SMTP extended verbs are defined by the extension model that is defined in [RFC 2821](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt). They allow addition of new functionality to the SMTP protocol. Microsoft Exchange uses one such extended verb to communicate routing and other Exchange-specific information among Exchange servers in an Exchange environment.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

On Exchange 2000, any anonymous user who could connect to an SMTP port on the Exchange Server and issue a specially crafted extended verb request.

On Exchange 2003, the level of authentication required to exploit this vulnerability is typically only granted to other Exchange Servers within the same organization. In this case, the attacker would have to connect to an SMTP port on the Exchange Server with the authority of another Exchange Server within the same organization and issue and issue a specially crafted extended verb request.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An unauthenticated attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an SMTP port on the Exchange 2000 server and by issuing a specially-crafted extended verb request. This could allow an attacker to take any action on the system in the security context of the SMTP service. By default, the SMTP service runs as Local System.

For Exchange 2003, an attacker who could authenticate as an account in Exchange Enterprise Servers or Exchange Domain Servers groups could exploit this vulnerability.

**Because Exchange 2000 Server uses the Windows 2000 SMTP service, does the vulnerability affect the SMTP service in Windows 2000?**

No. The vulnerability does not affect the Microsoft SMTP service on systems that are running Windows 2000 that do not have Exchange 2000 Server installed.

The vulnerability also does not affect the Microsoft SMTP services that can be installed on Windows NT Server 4.0 or on Windows XP.

**Can this be exploited directly by using e-mail?**

No. This vulnerability could not be exploited by sending a specially-crafted e-mail message to a mailbox that is hosted on an Exchange server. An attacker would have to connect directly to the SMTP port on an Exchange server.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the SMTP Service validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

Additionally, the update for Exchange 2000 adds authentication requirements similar to those already present in Exchange 2003.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**File Information:**

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 1:

| File Name | Version | Date | Time | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Xlsasink.dll | 6.5.7232.89 | 02-Mar-2005 | 20:26 | 60,416 |

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Exchange Server 2003\SP2\KB894549

**Note:** This registry key may not be not created properly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 894549 security update into the installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyze, Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

Vulnerability Details
=====================
The vulnerability is a heap overflow in SvrAppendReceivedChunk function
which is located in xlsasink.dll.
When transmitting large chunks with X-LINK2STATE verb it is possible to
overflow the heap and perform arbitrary memory write in RtlAllocateHeap
function.
77fcc663 8901             mov     [ecx],eax
77fcc665 894804           mov     [eax+0x4],ecx
We are controlling ECX and EAX registers. So rewriting
lpTopLevelExceptionFilter can easily get us to our shellcode on the
heap.

Regards,

Evgeny Pinchuk
