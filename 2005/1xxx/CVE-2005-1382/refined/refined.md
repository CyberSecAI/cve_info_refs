### CVE-2005-1382
```
The content relates to CVE-2005-1382.

*   **Vulnerability:** It is possible to corrupt any file of an Oracle Application Server installation by appending garbage to the file (e.g. `httpd.conf`).
*   **Systems Affected:** Oracle Application Server with Webcache 9i.
*   **Attack Vector:** By submitting a crafted request to the webcache administrator application, an attacker can append arbitrary data to files on the server.
*   **Impact:** Corruption of files, potentially leading to denial of service or other unspecified impacts. This can be combined with [cross site scripting vulnerabilities](http://www.reddatabasesecurity.com/advisory/oracle_webcache_CSS_vulnerabilities.html) in the webcache administrator application.
*   **Details:**

    *   The vulnerability exists in Oracle Webcache 9i.
    *   The vulnerability involves the `CGA.CacheDump` screen and the `cache_dump_file` parameter.
    *   By manipulating the `cache_dump_file` parameter, an attacker can specify a file to which garbage data will be appended.
*   **Example Testcase:**
    `http://server01:4000/webcacheadmin?SCREEN_ID=CGA.CacheDump&ACTION=Submit&index=1&cache_dump_file=/opt/ORACLE/ias/9.0.2/Apache/Apache/conf/httpd.conf`
