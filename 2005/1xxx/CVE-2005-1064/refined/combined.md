| [Description](#c0)  Jacob Perkins    2002-02-27 23:13:48 UTC  ``` Evolution mail component seg faults when I go to tools->filters->select any filter->edit->cancel and then evolution must be restarted.  Am using evolutions 1.02 in kde2.2.2 ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-03 15:37:47 UTC  ``` I can get it not to crash, but then the edit dialog is grayed out (filter->edit), and you loose your settings anyhow. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-04 16:58:25 UTC  ``` Hi!  Have you (Jacob) checked <http://bugzilla.ximian.com/query.cgi> to see if it is a  known problem with the package.  It might be an upstream problem.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Jacob Perkins    2002-03-04 22:53:22 UTC  ``` Based on the bug reports submitted to ximian, it's probably not a gentoo issue ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Bruce A. Locke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-07 00:17:53 UTC  ```  Upstream issue.  Marking as INVALID.  If someone finds a patch before the next upstream release of evolution feel free to attach it and we'll reopen the bug and check it in.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Edward Muller    2002-03-18 08:53:02 UTC  ``` What upstream bug were you reffering to? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-18 09:55:46 UTC  ``` What he means, is that it is a evolution bug, that should be fixed by the evolution developers.  Hallski already patched this in 1.0.1, just in a different section, and submited the patch.  Seemed as its on CVS now, if I remember correctly.  Thus, hopefully 1.0.3 will fix this. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Panax    2002-03-23 16:36:24 UTC  ``` Red Hat's version of Evolution 1.02 does not segfault when you try to edit filters. So it seems it might not be upstream OR Red Hat fixed it and didn't tell anyone, but maybe the gentoo developers can find the fix? ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-01 17:11:43 UTC  ``` Fixed in 1.0.3-r1 :)  If you ask me, then it is a upstream issue.  They plain just do not do proper error checking, and it seems as if there was a type-o as  well. ``` |  |

============================================================================
rsnapshot Security Advisory 001                       security@rsnapshot.org
<http://www.rsnapshot.org/security/>
Apr 10th, 2005                                             Nathan Rosenquist
============================================================================

  Severity:      high
  Vulnerability: local privilege escalation
  Fix provided:  yes

-------------
1) Background
-------------

rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility for making backups of local and
remote systems.

Using rsync and hard links, it is possible to keep multiple, full backups
instantly available. The disk space required is just a little more than the
space of one full backup, plus incrementals.

----------------------
2) Problem description
----------------------

The copy_symlink() subroutine in rsnapshot incorrectly changes file
ownership on the files pointed to by symlinks, not on the symlinks
themselves. This would allow, under certain circumstances, an arbitrary
user to take ownership of a file on the main filesystem.

This subroutine is called under the following circumstances:

  a) If the cmd_cp parameter has NOT been enabled, OR

  b) If the backup_script parameter is set, and the backup script
     generates symlinks as part of its output

  c) AND if the attacker can create symlinks in a directory that is backed
     up, either by creating them directly or influencing a backup script.

This vulnerability has been fixed in rsnapshot versions 1.1.7 and 1.2.1.
It is recommended that all users upgrade immediately.

-----------------------
3) Upgrade Instructions
-----------------------

For users of rsnapshot 1.2.0, download and install version 1.2.1.

For users of rsnapshot 1.1.6 or earlier, download and install version
1.1.7.

  ---------------
  rsnapshot 1.2.1
  ---------------
  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot-1.2.1.tar.gz>
  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot-1.2.1.tar.gz.asc>

  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot-1.2.1-1.noarch.rpm>
  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot-1.2.1-1.noarch.rpm.asc>

  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot_1.2.1-1_all.deb>
  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot_1.2.1-1_all.deb.asc>

  ---------------
  rsnapshot 1.1.7
  ---------------
  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot-1.1.7.tar.gz>
  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot-1.1.7.tar.gz.asc>

  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot-1.1.7-1.noarch.rpm>
  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot-1.1.7-1.noarch.rpm.asc>

  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot_1.1.7-1_all.deb>
  <http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot_1.1.7-1_all.deb.asc>

--------------
4) Workarounds
--------------

Enable the cmd_cp parameter (requires GNU cp, and works best on Linux).

Make sure any scripts specified by the backup_script parameter do not
create symlinks.

# rsnapshot: Local privilege escalation — GLSA **200504-12**

rsnapshot allows a local user to take ownership of local files, resulting
in privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-backup/rsnapshot** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.1**revision >= **1.1.7** |

### Background

rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility based on rsync, allowing
local and remote systems backups.

### Description

The copy\_symlink() subroutine in rsnapshot follows symlinks when
changing file ownership, instead of changing the ownership of the
symlink itself.

### Impact

Under certain circumstances, local attackers can exploit this
vulnerability to take ownership of arbitrary files, resulting in local
privilege escalation.

### Workaround

The copy\_symlink() subroutine is not called if the cmd\_cp parameter has
been enabled.

### Resolution

All rsnapshot users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose app-backup/rsnapshot
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
