Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2005-1064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `copy_symlink()` subroutine of rsnapshot. Instead of changing the ownership of the symlink itself, the subroutine incorrectly changes the ownership of the file pointed to by the symlink.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Symlink Handling:** The core issue is that `copy_symlink()` modifies the ownership of the target file, not the symlink itself. This allows an attacker to manipulate file ownership on the main filesystem.
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** By taking ownership of system files or files belonging to other users, an attacker can escalate their privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local user can gain ownership of arbitrary files on the system. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system, as the attacker can modify system configurations, execute commands with escalated privileges, or access sensitive information.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** With elevated privileges, an attacker could modify or delete critical system files, causing instability or complete system failure.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Symlink Creation:** The attacker must be able to create symlinks within a directory that is being backed up by rsnapshot.
- **Backup Script Influence:** Alternatively, the attacker could influence a backup script such that the script generates symlinks as part of its output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local user access to the system where rsnapshot is running.
- **Write Access to Backup Directory:** The attacker must have write access to a directory that is being backed up or influence the backup process to create symlinks within that directory.
- **rsnapshot Configuration:** The vulnerability is triggered if the `cmd_cp` parameter is not enabled or if the `backup_script` parameter is set and the script generates symlinks.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided documents indicate that the issue was resolved in rsnapshot versions 1.1.7 and 1.2.1.
- Workarounds include enabling the `cmd_cp` parameter or ensuring that backup scripts do not create symlinks.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200504-12) specifically addresses this vulnerability in their `app-backup/rsnapshot` package.
- This vulnerability allows local privilege escalation, and its severity is considered "high".
