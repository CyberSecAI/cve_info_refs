The provided content is a blog post describing a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the comersus ASP shopping cart application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, the application directly includes variables within the HTML source code without adequate encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS because it does not sanitize user-provided input that is later displayed in the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a web page viewed by a user. This can be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface web pages, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript within a variable. When the vulnerable page displays the value of that variable, the script is executed in the context of the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and trick a victim into visiting that URL (e.g., through phishing, malicious links). The attacker doesn't need to have any privileged access or position on the server.
