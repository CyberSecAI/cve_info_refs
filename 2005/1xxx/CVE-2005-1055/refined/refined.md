- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application stores the admin username and password (hashed with MD5) in a text file located in a publicly accessible directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability due to storing sensitive information (admin credentials) in a plain text file within the web server's document root. This allows direct access to the file via a web browser.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to the admin username and password (in MD5 hash form) by directly accessing the file, allowing them to potentially gain full control of the blog.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access via a web browser by requesting the vulnerable file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only needs to know the URL to the vulnerable file which is `/path/to/blog/_dat/login` in the example provided in the advisory.
