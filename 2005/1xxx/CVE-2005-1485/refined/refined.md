Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-1485

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw in Golden FTP Server Pro, specifically in how it handles file paths. The server doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-supplied file paths, allowing directory traversal sequences to escape the intended FTP root directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The core weakness is the ability to use ".." sequences in file paths to navigate outside of the designated FTP root directory.
*   **Path Disclosure:** The server discloses the full path of the shared directory by attempting to open a non-existent file with a full path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can access any file on the server's file system that the FTP server process has access to.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** By accessing arbitrary files, attackers can potentially obtain sensitive data, configuration files, or system files, including the SAM file containing user credentials.
*   **Information Gathering:** An attacker can disclose the full path of the server's shared directory and gain more information about the server's configuration and file system layout, which can be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **FTP Commands:** The attack is carried out through standard FTP commands, particularly `GET` and `CD`.
*   **Directory Traversal Sequences:** The attacker utilizes `..` sequences in the `GET` command's file path to navigate outside the FTP root.
*  **Requesting non-existent file with a full path:** The attacker attempts to access a non-existent file using a full path, which discloses the path of the ftp root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **FTP Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the FTP server.
*   **FTP Account:** The attacker needs access to an FTP account with a shared folder defined in the Golden FTP Server settings. The provided examples use anonymous access.
*   **Basic FTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to use FTP commands like `GET` and `CD`.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was tested and confirmed on Golden FTP Server Pro v2.52.
*   The proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates that by first navigating to a shared directory and then using `GET "\../winnt/repair/sam"`, the attacker can retrieve the SAM file from the Windows operating system and by using `GET "C:\blah"`, the attacker can disclose the path of the shared directory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor was notified on 02/05/2005, but there was no response or patch released at the time of the vulnerability disclosure (03/05/2005).
*   The advisory confirms other versions may be affected.
*   The Secunia advisory link (<http://secunia.com/advisories/15175/>) provides further context to this vulnerability.
