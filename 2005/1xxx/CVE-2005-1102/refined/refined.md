Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2005-1102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of input validation in WordPress, specifically within the handling of post titles and content. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and script code, as well as SQL injection via the 'tb_id' parameter in `wp-trackback.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The vulnerability allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code within post titles and content.
2.  **HTML Injection:** The vulnerability allows the injection of arbitrary HTML code within post titles and content, including iframes.
3.  **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability exists in `wp-trackback.php` due to insufficient validation of the `tb_id` parameter, allowing for the injection of SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies (and thus session information), redirecting the user, or performing other malicious actions.
*  **HTML Injection:** An attacker can deface the website or embed malicious iframes.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information from the database, such as user password hashes, by performing SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS and HTML Injection:** These can be exploited by posting malicious content through the title and content fields of a WordPress post. This requires a user with posting privileges to insert the malicious code.
*  **SQL Injection:** This can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the `wp-trackback.php` script, specifically manipulating the `tb_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS and HTML Injection:** Requires a registered user with the ability to post content on the affected WordPress site.
*  **SQL Injection:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and can send a crafted request over the web to inject SQL via the `tb_id` parameter of `wp-trackback.php`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The initial report was regarding XSS and HTML injection, but later it was discovered that SQL injection was also present.
*   The provided 'fix' by SoulBlack was considered insufficient. WordPress developers later addressed the issues in version 1.5.1.2, along with input sanitization via the kses filter.
*   The Gentoo team initially masked the package due to concerns about upstream's response to security issues.
*   The issue with iframes was deemed less critical since it required trusted users to post malicious content, which was considered a common issue in CMS systems.
*   The SQL injection was discovered later and confirmed. This SQL injection was possible in wp-trackback.php file.
*   The vulnerability could be used to gain password hashes from the database using SQL injection in tb_id parameter.
*   The vulnerability could potentially affect not only posts, but comments too.
*   The fix for the XSS and HTML injection was replacing `< > ( )` with `&lt; &gt; &#40; &#41;` using `str_replace` function.
