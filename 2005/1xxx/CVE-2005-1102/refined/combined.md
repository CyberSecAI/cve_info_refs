# Wordpress: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200506-04**

Wordpress contains SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/wordpress** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.1.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.1.2** |

### Background

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based content management and publishing
system.

### Description

Due to a lack of input validation, WordPress is vulnerable to SQL
injection and XSS attacks.

### Impact

An attacker could use the SQL injection vulnerabilities to gain
information from the database. Furthermore the cross-site scripting
issues give an attacker the ability to inject and execute malicious
script code or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials,
potentially compromising the victim's browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Wordpress users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-1.5.1.2"
```

  Is anyone in development aware of, or has anyone addressed the security vuln which was released yesterday? I’ll post the content here, as it also includes the fix. I am about to embark on the fix, but I didn’t see anything here about this being addressed, so here it is:

  ============================================================

  Title: WordPress XSS and HTML injection

  Vulnerability discovery: SoulBlack – Security Research –

  <http://soulblack.com.ar>

  Date: 12/04/2005

  Severity: Medium. users can obtain cookies of other users and defacement website

  Affected version: <= 1.5

  ============================================================

  ============================================================

  \*Summary

  <http://wordpress.org>. WordPress is a popular blogging system built on

  PHP (the scripting language) and is licensed under the GPL. It is free

  software supported by a large and vibrant community of users. You can

  use WordPress as a stand-alone application to publish your web log, or

  incorporate its functionality into an existing site.

  ============================================================

  \*Problem Description:

  Bug is in the content and title of post, when not controlling the

  entrance of characters, being able to inject HTML code

  ============================================================

  \*Example:

  Type in the title or content of post

  <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

  <iframe src=http://othersite/sb.php>

  ============================================================

  \*Fix:

  wordpress\wp-includes\template-functions-post.php

  function get\_the\_title($id = 0) {

  .

  .

  .

  return $title;

  }

  replace for by function

  function get\_the\_title($id = 0) {

  .

  .

  .

  $sb\_convert = $output;

  $sb\_input = array(“<“,”>”,”(“,”)”);

  $sb\_output = array(“<“,”>”,”(”,”)”);

  $output = str\_replace($sb\_input, $sb\_output, $sb\_convert);

  return $title;

  }

  function get\_the\_content($more\_link\_text = ‘(more…)’, $stripteaser =

  0, $more\_file = ”) {

  .

  .

  .

  return $output;

  }

  replace for by function

  function get\_the\_content($more\_link\_text = ‘(more…)’, $stripteaser =

  0, $more\_file = ”) {

  .

  .

  .

  $sb\_convert = $output;

  $sb\_input = array(“<“,”>”,”(“,”)”);

  $sb\_output = array(“<“,”>”,”(”,”)”);

  $output = str\_replace($sb\_input, $sb\_output, $sb\_convert);

  return $output;

  }

  ============================================================

  Interesting.

  One thing that I dont like is that is NOT mentioned on <http://www.securiteam.com/> or any other related web site that ive checked.

  The other thing I dont like is that I am not able to follow exactly how theyre calling the exploit. I understand what they have said, but cannot recreate it. Therefore, since it is not mentioned anywhere else, Im hesitant to change a file since perhaps I am introducing a problem. Especially, when the fix is coming from THEM and not someone here.

  Just my .02 and I will be waiting for any other responses.

  Edit : Actually I just realized that unless im mis-reading that completely thats only exploitable via posting? (I checked comments btw, good thing must ppl dont allow <script> tags) I was in fact, able to snag a cookie with their example.

  Which makes it somewhat less sketchy than on first glance.

  Maybe there needs to be a ‘security list’ that select people can subscribe to? For those of us doing extensive hacking and plugins and such, would be nice if the devs would share the ‘problems’ and the ‘solutions’ with a larger audience.

  And security vulnerabilities are already getting posted in public forums, why wouldn’t we want people to know? I mean, make a ‘Security’ section on the site here that DOESN’T show up in the normal front-page master list, so the average joe doesn’t freak, but the rest of us have a forum to discuss stuff.

  I find that too much is being pushed to bug dbs and email lists, where the primary devs might be able to track easily, but for the rest of us it’s a signal-to-noise problem… 😉

  Because it was a problem last time. The security issue poster did not notify the developers and only posted the issue on the forums. As a result, the developers had no clue about the issue and exploits of the vulnerability spread like wildfire.

  In my opinion, this isn’t as much of a threat to WordPress as it seems.

  In essence, the ‘exploit’ is that a registered user with posting permission can include any HTML, including javascript or an iframe, in a post title or a post body. This javascript would then be executed or the iframe be visible in any readers browser!

  That’s right. It’s a blogging system. It’s a simplified CMS. It would be a pretty poor one without HTML.

  In other words if you trust someone, including yourself, to post stories on your blog then you have to trust that they won’t do anything naughty!

  I don’t see that that is any different from any situation where you allow someone trusted to put content on your site.

  Maybe someone could produce a plug-in that disables all html for use on a multi author site where you don’t trust the authors! Perhaps you might want to only allow them to use Textile or Markdown, though neither cover all that you might want to do in a post.

  Anyway, the above code is simplistic and inappropriate. There are better ways of sanitizing text. Take a look at the use of the kses filter.

  ” There are better ways of sanitizing text. Take a look at the use of the kses filter.”

  I’d emphasize that point, over and over again. If one is truly concerned over this “exploit”, add a couple filters on post title and content. Problem solved.

  Excellent post, Mike.

  macmanx: Nobody’s “spreading fear”, and clearly that wasn’t my intention. Obviously I’m concerned about the security of any software I’m using, as should anyone else be. I’m not reponsible for this person releasing his code into many public forums. I received this information on an easily accessible and very popular security mailing list. Any nefarious “hacker” already has this information, and I obviously have an interest in ensuring that developers here do to. Since it includes CODE WHICH CAN FIX THE PROBLEM, it makes sense to deliver it to those who can do something about it. There’s no link on “wordpress.org” to the link you suggest, so perhaps instead of chastising me for “spreading fear”, you should make available a proper and clearly defined mechanism for submitting security vulnerabilities.

  Sorry you’re upset about it and implicating ME as one who “spreads fear”. When there’s an exploit already available in the wild, the fear is justified. I asked a question, provided the data, and don’t need to be “scolded” for it, but thanks just the same.

WordPress is highly secure by default. Should  you be worried about this? Not if you haven't been worried by the past 5  years of blogging software or any other CMS in the world.  That said, I think a default feature restricting users lower than level  8 to a known subset of HTML would be useful, and will be including a  future release. A while back Mark Ghosh created the giant array that  KSES needs to accomplish this, I'm sure he (or I) still have it somewhere.  --  Matt Mullenweg ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-13 11:27:54 UTC  ``` I'm a bit concerned wbout that comment:  ============= > Owner logs on, sees a new draft, clicks on it to view, and has just lost  > his weblog.  That's pretty extreme. One person would have to invest a lot of time and  technical knowledge to execute that kind of exploit for very little (one  blog) payoff.  Additionally, if they do contain control (however they manage it, JS  XMLhttprequest *might* work) then what? They log in, post a bunch of  crap, hijack the blog for 20 minutes? Big deal. You should have backups,  and they don't actually have any passwords (they only have md5'd  cookies). So the recovery, sure, would be a pain, but would be quick.  Combine that with the minimal likely hood of this happening and I don't  think this comes close to anything critical. ==============  What he says basically is that you don't need security if you aren't the USAF or the NASA, and if you get hacked, so what, you've backups...  Let's wait a little and see if something comes out of this discussion. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-15 23:05:45 UTC  ``` Upstream still discussing what to do.

I've worked on a bump, but it's getting hard as upstream is not helping me at all.  I will continue and bump wordpress again, however I would like to request that, before I do so, security@ seriously consider serurity masking www-apps/wordpress.  Upstream clearly doesn't regard security very highly, and quite frankly, upstream have been a nightmare with this and other security issues - extracting blood from an ant comes to mind.  Again, apologies for being late on this one.  Being stretched very thing here ;) ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 01:04:11 UTC  ``` I don't want to waste more time on wordpress...

As I understand it, this only affects sites with multiple authors that have posting access.  Those with only one author, or with only a core group of authors who are fully trusted shouldn't have need to fear this potential vulnerability.    I agree that it should probably still be masked to protect the unwary, but perhaps the comment in /usr/portage/profiles/package.mask should direct users in the two cases I mentioned to feel free to unmask the file in /etc/portage/package.unmask? ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-03 13:43:33 UTC  ``` It references this bug and [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=88926#c18) is a fine description. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Marcel van den Bosch    2005-05-10 06:33:26 UTC  ``` Everything should be fixed in the new 1.5.1 version. ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-10 08:29:20 UTC  ``` The script issue seems to be solved, the iframe issue is not. ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-21 02:17:18 UTC  ``` Apparently there also is SQL injection...  ============================================================== From: 	  bugtraq@morph3us.org 	Subject: 	[BuHa Security] Wordpress SQL-Injection 	Date: 	May 19, 2005 11:52:58 PM EDT 	To: 	  bugtraq@securityfocus.com     --------------------------------------------------- | BuHa Security-Advisory #1     |    May 17th, 2005 |  --------------------------------------------------- | Vendor   | Wordpress                              | | URL      | <http://wordpress.org/>                  | | Version  | <= Wordpress 1.5                       | | Risk     | Moderate (SQL-Injection)               |  ---------------------------------------------------  o Description: =============  WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.   Visit <http://wordpress.org/> for detailed information.  o SQL-Injection: ===============  The most critical vulnerability in the 1.5 release of wordpress is an SQL-Injection in `wp-trackback.php'. It's not easily exploitable because you do not get a result when you inject a valid query but it's possible to bruteforce values in the tables - for example the password hashes.  Here some details: The parameter `tb_id' in `wp-trackback.php' is not validated correctly and there are no quotes in the SQL-query so an attacker is able to  insert sql commands.  $pingstatus = $wpdb->get_var("SELECT ping_status FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE ID = $tb_id"); 	 Example: (I converted the POST-request into a GET-request.)  $tb_id = 1 union select user_pass,0 from wp_users $url = bla $title = bla  </wp-trackback.php?tb_id=1%20union%20select%200,user_pass%20from%20 wp_users&url=bla&title=bla>  By injecting this query I get following databae error:  WordPress database error: [The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns] SELECT ping_status FROM wp_posts WHERE ID = 1 union select 0,  user_pass from wp_users  When I insert "1 union select user_pass from wp_users" as value for `tb_id' I get no error message because the query was well-formed - logical. Through the possibility to insert any sql-command it's possible to 'reconstruct' values of the tables.  o XSS: =====  </wp-admin/edit.php?s=[XSS]&submit=Search> </wp-admin/post.php?action=confirmdeletecomment&comment=1&p=[XSS]>  o Path Disclosure: =================  </wordpress-1.5-strayhorn/wp-content/themes/*> </wordpress-1.5-strayhorn/wp-includes/*> </wordpress-1.5-strayhorn/wp-admin/*>  Fatal error: Call to undefined function add_filter() in [...]/htdocs/testenv/blogs/wordpress/wordpress-1.5-strayhorn/ wp-content/themes/classic/comments-popup.php on line 3  o Disclosure Timeline: =====================  17 Apr 05 - Security flaws discovered. 19 Apr 05 - Vendor contacted. 10 May 05 - Vendor released bugfixed version. 17 May 05 - Public release.  o Solution: ==========  Upgrade to wordpress 1.5.1 [1]  o Credits: =========  Thomas Waldegger <bugtraq@morph3us.org> BuHa-Security Community - <http://buha.info/board/>  [1] <http://wordpress.org/development/2005/05/one-five-one/> ============================================================= ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-21 02:18:04 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 93355](show_bug.cgi?id=93355 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - wordpress <1.5 SQL injection") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-21 02:18:48 UTC  ``` Back in main scope for discussion ```  [Comment 26](#c26)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-22 22:37:23 UTC  ``` Release note for 1.5.1.1 does not mention a fix of the iframe issue.    <http://wordpress.org/development/2005/05/one-five-one/>    Is the iframe issue also relevant for comments or only posts?  ```  [Comment 27](#c27)  Aaron Kulbe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-24 11:57:55 UTC  ``` Potential issues with PHP were having display_errors turned on in php.ini, which goes against the advice of the PHP developers for use in a production environment.  It would allow security info to be displayed that was unnecessary.  Also, iframe is only an issue if the blog admin gives a new user the rights to publish and said user goes berserk and starts doing malicious things.  If the admin keeps things locked down, this isn't an issue at all.  This can happen on ANY platform if permissions are too loose.  There *have* been security issues found with users being able to reset admin passwords, and the password would go back to the original ownser.  This issue has been fixed in 1.5.1.1  Perhaps adding some einfo text is warranted, mentioning to users that they should take care who they give privileges too, but this is common sense.  In my opinion, it should be bumped to 1.5.1.1 ASAP, and this can be removed from package.mask and moved to ~.  ```  [Comment 28](#c28)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-25 06:48:26 UTC  ``` I think 1.5.1.1 can be unmasked. webapps please bump if you agree. ```  [Comment 29](#c29)  Aaron Kulbe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-27 08:01:01 UTC  ``` ka0ttic said I could go ahead and bump.
