The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in PostNuke: a local file inclusion vulnerability and a SQL injection vulnerability.

**1. Local File Inclusion Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `pnadminapi.php` script includes files based on user-supplied input in the `skin` parameter without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `xaninitlang_path` and `xaninit_path` variables are constructed using the `skin` parameter, which can be manipulated to include arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of input sanitization for the `skin` parameter.
    *   Use of `include_once` with user-controlled file paths.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with administrative privileges can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with a manipulated `skin` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires administrative privileges and the ability to send HTTP requests.
*   **Example URL:** `http://[HOST]/[DIR]/index.php?module=Xanthia&type=admin&func=addTheme&authid=&skin=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`

**2. SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `rimuovinuovezone` function in `pnadmin.php` constructs a SQL query using user-supplied input from the `riga` parameter without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of input sanitization for the `riga` parameter.
    *   Direct embedding of user-supplied data into SQL queries.
*  **Impact:** An attacker with administrative privileges can manipulate the SQL queries to extract data or perform other malicious actions on the database. The example provided shows extraction of username and password hashes.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with a manipulated `riga` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires administrative privileges and the ability to send HTTP requests.
*   **Example URL:** `http://[HOST]/[DIR]/index.php?module=Xanthia&type=admin&func=rimuovinuovezone&skinID=1&riga[0]='%20UNION%20SELECT%20pn_uname,pn_pass,pn_pass%20FROM%20pn__users%20WHERE%20pn_uid=2/*`

**Additional Notes:**
* The SQL injection is described as "non-critical" because it requires admin privileges.
* The file inclusion vulnerability is also tied to admin rights to access the vulnerable functions, but it could be considered critical given that it allows reading arbitrary files,
* A patch is available for PostNuke 0.750.
