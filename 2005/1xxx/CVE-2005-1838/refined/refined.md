```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Lack of input sanitization in `castnewPost.asp` and `caseModifyPost.asp` allows users to inject HTML and JavaScript code.
- SQL Injection: Vulnerable `clsListitem.asp` and `clscategory.asp` scripts do not properly sanitize user-supplied input via the `ID` property.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- XSS vulnerability in `castnewPost.asp` and `caseModifyPost.asp` via the `tbxAltEmail`, `tbxTitle`, `txtDescription`, and `txtResolution` form fields.
- SQL Injection in `clsListitem.asp` and `clscategory.asp` via the `ID` property, specifically through the `view.asp`, `register.asp` and `print.asp` pages.

Impact of exploitation:
- XSS: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks against other users of the application.
- SQL Injection: An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries, allowing for data retrieval, modification, or even complete database compromise.

Attack vectors:
- XSS: By submitting crafted input containing HTML or JavaScript in the specified form fields when creating or modifying a case.
- SQL Injection: By injecting malicious SQL code via the `id` parameter in the URLs of `view.asp`, `register.asp` and `print.asp`.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- XSS: The attacker needs the ability to submit data through the affected forms (`castnewPost.asp` and `caseModifyPost.asp`).
- SQL Injection: The attacker must be able to access and manipulate the query parameters for vulnerable pages (`view.asp`, `register.asp` and `print.asp`).
