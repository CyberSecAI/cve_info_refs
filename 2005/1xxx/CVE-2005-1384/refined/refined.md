Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-1384

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in phpCoin version 1.2.2 and below due to a lack of proper input sanitization before constructing SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the `search`, `login.php`, `mod.php`, parameters are vulnerable.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers could potentially bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data from the database, modify data within the database, or in some cases gain complete control over the database server if the database user has sufficient privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vectors are through the following HTTP GET requests. The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameters.
    *   `index.php?title=Special%3aSearch&search=SQL_INJECTION`
    *   `login.php?w=user&o=login&phpcoinsessid=SQL_INJECTION`
    *    `mod.php?mod=siteinfo&id=SQL_INJECTION`
    *    `mod.php?mod=pages&mode=list&dtopic_id=SQL_INJECTION`
    *    `mod.php?mod=pages&mode=list&dcat_id=SQL_INJECTION`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected phpCoin server. No special privileges are needed, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory provides specific examples of vulnerable parameters and how to inject SQL code.
*   The advisory recommends using `htmlspeacialchars()`, `mysql_escape_string()`, `mysql_real_escape_string()` or equivalent functions to validate user input.

**Summary:**
The content provides detailed information about the SQL injection vulnerabilities in phpCoin 1.2.2 and below, including specific vulnerable parameters and proof-of-concept exploits, which is more detailed than a standard CVE description which would typically not include exploit examples.
