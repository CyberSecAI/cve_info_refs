- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how Pico Server (pServ) handles path traversal when CGI-BIN support is enabled. The server attempts to prevent directory traversal using a counter that increases on a '/' and decreases on a '/../'. However, it fails to account for multiple consecutive '/' characters which allow the counter to stay positive while traversing out of the cgi-bin directory using '/../'.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation for path traversal, specifically related to handling multiple consecutive '/' characters. This allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on accessing files outside the cgi-bin directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the same permissions as the pServ process. This includes downloading and executing malicious scripts.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to the web server by crafting a URL that exploits the path traversal vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable pServ instance. No special authentication or privileges are needed.
