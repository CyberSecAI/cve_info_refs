Package        : gaim
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-1269 CAN-2005-1934

Two denial of service problems have been discovered in Gaim, a
multi-protocol instant messaging client.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-1269

    A malformed Yahoo filename can result in a crash of the application.

CAN-2005-1934

    A malformed MSN message can lead to incorrect memory allocation
    resulting in a crash of the application.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.1-1.3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gaim package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Gaim: Denial of Service vulnerabilities — GLSA **200506-11**

Gaim contains two remote Denial of Service vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-im/gaim** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.1** |

### Background

Gaim is a full featured instant messaging client which handles a
variety of instant messaging protocols.

### Description

Jacopo Ottaviani discovered a vulnerability in the Yahoo! file
transfer code when being offered files with names containing non-ASCII
characters (CAN-2005-1269).

Hugo de Bokkenrijder discovered a
vulnerability when receiving malformed MSN messages (CAN-2005-1934).

### Impact

Both vulnerabilities cause Gaim to crash, resulting in a Denial of
Service.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
