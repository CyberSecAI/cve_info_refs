      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "Groove Virtual Office COM objects may be accessed insecurely.",
       "details": "Groove Virtual Office may allow access restrictions on COM objects to be bypassed. Exploitation may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. A vulnerability exists in Groove that may allow an attacker to bypass Groove's security restrictions and arbitrarily use a COM object's services, such as script execution. If the access restrictions of a COM object that allows remote access are compromised, that object may be exploited remotely.",
      "affected_components": [
        "Groove Virtual Office"
      ],
      "root_cause": "Improper access restrictions on COM objects.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Insecure access control of COM objects"
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of exploitation depends on the COM object being attacked. Potential consequences may include the remote execution of arbitrary scripting code, a denial-of-service condition, and the disclosure of sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Bypassing security restrictions to use COM object services"
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable COM objects, potentially remotely if the object supports it.",
       "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can lead to remote execution of arbitrary scripting code."
