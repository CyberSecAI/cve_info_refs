Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The RSA Authentication Agent for Web running on Microsoft IIS fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, it does not filter HTML from the "postdata" parameter within HTTP POST requests sent to `/WebID/IISWebAgentIF.dll`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input validation allows for the injection of malicious HTML and script code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution in User's Browser:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed within the context of the user's browser when they interact with the vulnerable application.
*   **Impersonation:** This allows the attacker to potentially impersonate the user.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker can steal sensitive information like protected cookies and other data from the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/WebID/IISWebAgentIF.dll`.
*   **"postdata" Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected within the "postdata" parameter of this POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be on the local network; the attack can be carried out remotely.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Oliver Karow
*  The vendor, RSA Security, was cooperative and provided a patch
* The vulnerability was patched in version 5.3
