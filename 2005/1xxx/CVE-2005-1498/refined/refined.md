The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in myBloggie 2.1.1, not just one, but they are all related to the product.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of the `post_id` parameter.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of the full server path.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with an empty `post_id` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires only network access to the vulnerable application.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Input passed to the `year` parameter in `viewmode.php` and other parameters (`cat_id`, `month_no`, `post_id`) are not sanitized. Also, unsanitized parameters are reflected back in the HTML page when an SQL error occurs.
    *  **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization, and improper error handling.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session within the context of the vulnerable site, potentially leading to cookie theft or other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with malicious JavaScript code injected into the vulnerable parameters.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires only network access to the vulnerable application.

3. **Arbitrary Comment Deletion:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of access control checks when deleting comments.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure direct object reference.
    *   **Impact:**  Any user can delete any comment by crafting a specific URL, bypassing the intended access control.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a URL with a target `comment_id` and the `confirm=yes` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires only network access to the vulnerable application, and knowledge of comment ID to be deleted.

4.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized input from the `keyword` parameter in `search.php`, and `date_no`, `cat_id`, `month_no`, and `post_id` parameters.
    *  **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization and use of user-supplied data in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or even complete system takeover.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with malicious SQL code injected into the vulnerable parameters.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires only network access to the vulnerable application.
