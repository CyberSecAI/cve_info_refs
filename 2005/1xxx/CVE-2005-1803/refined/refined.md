The provided content discusses a security patch for NARVAL, a content management system. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The patch addresses multiple security issues, specifically:
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
*   SQL Injection vulnerabilities
*   Bugs in the NARVAL system

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XSS:** The presence of XSS vulnerabilities indicates that user-supplied input was not properly sanitized before being displayed on web pages, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
*   **SQL Injection:** The existence of SQL injection vulnerabilities suggests that user input was directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization. This would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
    *   Steal user session cookies, potentially hijacking accounts.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the website.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
    *   Gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain control of the database server itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** Attackers would exploit XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into the web application via user-supplied input fields.
*  **SQL Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious SQL code through user-provided input fields that are used in the construction of SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Attackers need to be able to inject malicious code/SQL through the application's input mechanisms. This requires knowledge of the vulnerable input points.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The patch "narval-secur-path.zip" includes "url_protect" and fixes for XSS/SQL injection vulnerabilities, plus some general bug fixes.
*   The text states that simply implementing "url\_protect.php" is not enough and that this patch addresses other issues.
*   The text implies that the "SABLE" system has these corrections already built in.
* The patch was released on 26/05/2005, which is close to the date of the CVE (2005), suggesting a correlation.
