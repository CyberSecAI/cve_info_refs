  Software: MidiCart PHP Shopping Cart
  Homepage: <http://www.midicart.com/>
  Author: "Exoduks" - HackGen Team
  Release Date: 5 May, 2005
  Website: [www.hackgen.org](http://www.hackgen.org)
  Mail: exoduks [at] gmail . com

 0x01 - Affected software description:
 -------------------------------------
 MidiCart is a Try-Before-You-Buy Shopping Cart Software, that provides all you need \
to   create, operate, and maintain a professional Internet shop. MidiCart ASP and PHP \
Shopping   Cart is extremely easy to use, flexible, powerful and affordable \
e-commerce solution for   your web site.

 0x02 - Vulnerability Discription:
 ---------------------------------
 There are several vulnarabilities in midicart. First there are some full-path \
disclosure  bugs because of some undefined variable and if php.ini is set to \
display_errors = on we   will see full path of the script. Second vulnerability is \
xss in item_list.php and   search_list.php file which doesn't have any checking of \
input string so it is possible to   inject some evil code and execute through the \
browser. Third bug is a sql injection also   in search_list.php, item_list.php and \
item_show.php file also because there isn't any   filtering and checking of input \
string which will be executed in mysql command so with   special crafted sql command \
we can get some sensitve information from database.

 0x03 - Vulnerability Code:
 --------------------------
 Code vulnarable to sql injectio in search_list.php file
 ...
 // database query to select the categories
 $result = mysql_query("select * from products WHERE $chose LIKE '%$searchstring%' \
ORDER BY   'maingroup','secondgroup','code_no' LIMIT 0, 100 ") ;
 ...

 Code vulnarable to sql injectio in item_show.php file
 // query to get the products of type $category
 $result = mysql_query("select * from products where(code_no = '$code_no') ORDER BY \
'item'");

 0x04 - How to fix this bug:
 ---------------------------
 Vendor has beed contacted and he we probably publish new version of this shopping \
cart so go to   <http://www.midicart.com/> and look for new version.

 0x05 - Exploit:
 ----------------

 Full-path disclosure !
 -----------------------
 <http://site.com/shop/search_list.php>

  <http://site.com/shop/item_list.php?maingroup=%3Cscript%3Ealert>('Lamed%20!');%3C/script%3E

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
