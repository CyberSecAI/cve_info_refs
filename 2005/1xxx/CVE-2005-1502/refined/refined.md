        "impact": "An attacker can:\n\n*   Gain full path disclosure of the application, potentially revealing sensitive information about the server environment.\n*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser by injecting malicious code through XSS vulnerabilities.\n*   Retrieve sensitive data from the database through SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
