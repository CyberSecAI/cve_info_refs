The provided content details two vulnerabilities in PHPNuke versions 6.x - 7.6: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Full Path Disclosure.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root cause:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within several modules allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Lack of input validation and sanitization when processing `username`, `avatarcategory`, and `lid` parameters in the `Your_Account` and `Downloads` modules.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable parameters that could allow them to steal user cookies and perform actions with the user's privileges.
*   **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious URLs containing the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters of the mentioned modules. The example includes constructing a form to submit the XSS payload as `lid` to `/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=outsidedownloadsetup`
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs. No authentication is mentioned as required to exploit this XSS vulnerability.

**Full Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root cause:** Direct access to certain scripts with specific parameters or through errors can expose the full server path due to improper error handling and lack of output sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  The scripts fail to properly handle errors or user requests by outputting full file paths in PHP error messages.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain sensitive information about the server's file structure, which might aid in further attacks. The path to configuration files such as `config.php` is exposed.
*   **Attack vectors:** By accessing specific vulnerable URLs such as `index.php?forum_admin=1`, `modules.php?name=Surveys&op=results&pollID=[id]&mode=&order=&thold=&tid=[something]`, and `modules.php?name=Your_Account&op=avatarlist`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable URLs. No authentication or further capabilities are explicitly stated.
