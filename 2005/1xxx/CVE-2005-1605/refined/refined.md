```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Site Studio guestbook does not properly filter HTML code from user-supplied input.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can inject malicious script into the guestbook that will be executed by the browser of any user who visits the affected page. The script executes within the security context of the vulnerable site.
- Attack vectors: 
    - By entering malicious code in the "name" input field of the guestbook.
    - Standalone Site Studio installations may be accessed via: http://[HOST]:8080/studio/servlet/psoft.guestbook.GuestBookServ
    - Integrated Site Studio with H-Sphere may be accessed via: http://[host]/cp/Scripts/perl/guestbook/E-Guest\_sign.pl
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to submit a guestbook entry with malicious HTML/JavaScript code. No special privileges or access is required.
