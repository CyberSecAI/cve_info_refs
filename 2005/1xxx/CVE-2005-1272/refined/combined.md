## Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup Agents vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#279774

Original Release Date: 2005-08-03 | Last Revised: 2007-01-12

---

### Overview

Several Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup Agents contain a buffer overflow, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup is a cross-platform backup and recovery application. Backup Agents are available to provide backup support for additional applications, such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, SAP R/3, and Microsoft Exchange.  The ARCserve Backup Agents fail to properly validate input, which creates a buffer overflow vulnerability. By default, the Backup Agents listen on 6070/tcp.Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a system running the vulnerable Backup Agent. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or patch**Upgrade or install patches, as recommended by the [Computer Associates vulnerability 33239 description](http://www3.ca.com/securityadvisor/vulninfo/vuln.aspx?id=33239). |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**You may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the ports used by the Backup Agents (typically 6070/tcp). This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. The use of host-based firewalls in addition to network-based firewalls can help restrict access to specific hosts within the network. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. |
