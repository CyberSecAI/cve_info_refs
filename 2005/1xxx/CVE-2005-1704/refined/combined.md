| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-04 01:15:32 UTC  ``` various applications dealing with binary files are vulnerable to a heap overflow, it's possible to integer overflow the argument to malloc by specifying a specific number of section headers that when multiplied with the size of the struct required to store the section headers, leading to a heap overflow.   I believe this issue to be exploitable.  The following packages are known to be vulnerable:  sys-devel/binutils (objdump, strings (!!!), nm, etc) dev-libs/elfutils (eu-readelf, etc) app-editors/hteditor sys-devel/gdb  There are probably more, an example (harmless) binary  that triggers this bug is attached. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-04 01:16:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 57996](attachment.cgi?id=57996 "example malformed binary") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=57996&action=edit "example malformed binary")] example malformed binary ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-04 01:31:29 UTC  ``` add execstack/prelink to the list ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-04 01:45:45 UTC  ``` sys-apps/less uses strings in lesspipe.sh, convincing someone a binary is a text file (eg, calling it README.TXT) and getting someone to run less on it could trigger this vulnerability.  try running less on the attached binary, then look at the console.  /usr/bin/lesspipe.sh: line 10: 15082 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) strings "$F" ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-04 02:29:08 UTC  ``` Only the first 78 bytes of the a.out matter.

| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-04 01:15:32 UTC  ``` various applications dealing with binary files are vulnerable to a heap overflow, it's possible to integer overflow the argument to malloc by specifying a specific number of section headers that when multiplied with the size of the struct required to store the section headers, leading to a heap overflow.   I believe this issue to be exploitable.  The following packages are known to be vulnerable:  sys-devel/binutils (objdump, strings (!!!), nm, etc) dev-libs/elfutils (eu-readelf, etc) app-editors/hteditor sys-devel/gdb  There are probably more, an example (harmless) binary  that triggers this bug is attached. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-04 01:16:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 57996](attachment.cgi?id=57996 "example malformed binary") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=57996&action=edit "example malformed binary")] example malformed binary ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-04 01:31:29 UTC  ``` add execstack/prelink to the list ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-04 01:45:45 UTC  ``` sys-apps/less uses strings in lesspipe.sh, convincing someone a binary is a text file (eg, calling it README.TXT) and getting someone to run less on it could trigger this vulnerability.  try running less on the attached binary, then look at the console.  /usr/bin/lesspipe.sh: line 10: 15082 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) strings "$F" ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-04 02:29:08 UTC  ``` Only the first 78 bytes of the a.out matter.

gdb security update (RHSA-2005-801)

Original Release Date: January 16, 2006

Last Revised: November 8, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-015

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

GDB, the GNU debugger, allows debugging of programs written in C,
C++, and
other languages by executing them in a controlled fashion, then
printing
their data.

Several integer overflow bugs were found in gdb. If a user is tricked
into
processing a specially crafted executable file, it may allow the
execution
of arbitrary code as the user running gdb. The Common Vulnerabilities
and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CAN-2005-1704](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1704) to this issue.

A bug was found in the way gdb loads .gdbinit files. When a user
executes
gdb, the local directory is searched for a .gdbinit file which is
then
loaded. It is possible for a local user to execute arbitrary commands
as
the user running gdb by placing a malicious .gdbinit file in a
location
where gdb may be run. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CAN-2005-1705](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1705) to this issue.

Several Avaya System products utilize gdb, however only Avaya
services personnel
have access to gdb, therefore lowering the risk of exploitation.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-801.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with gdb installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | 1.x - 3.0 | Low | Upgrade to CM 3.1 or later |
| Avaya Sip EnablementServices (SES) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. An update is being considered for a future release. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below. An update is being considered for a future release. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 1.x - 2.x | Low | Update to MSS 3.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below. An update is being considered for a future release. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of gdb, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected
by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may
be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | all? | Low | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. Red
Hat).

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com/) and through your

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Binutils, elfutils: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200506-01**

Various utilities from the GNU Binutils and elfutils packages are
vulnerable to a heap based buffer overflow, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/elfutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.108** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.108** |

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.16-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.14.90.0.8-r3**revision >= **2.15.90.0.1.1-r5**revision >= **2.15.90.0.3-r5**revision >= **2.15.91.0.2-r2**revision >= **2.15.92.0.2-r10**>= **2.16-r1** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and
analyse binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File
Descriptor library, to do low-level manipulation. Elfutils provides a
library and utilities to access, modify and analyse ELF objects.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy and Ned Ludd of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
discovered an integer overflow in the BFD library and elfutils,
resulting in a heap based buffer overflow.

### Impact

Successful exploitation would require a user to access a specially
crafted binary file, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GNU Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose sys-devel/binutils
```

All elfutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/elfutils-0.108"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

elfutils security update (RHSA-2006-0368)

Original Release Date: August 31, 2006

Last Revised: January 24, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-178

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The elfutils packages contain a number of utility programs and libraries
related to the creation and maintenance of executable code.

Previous versions of the elfutils packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
utilized a version of elfutils that was licensed under the GNU Public License
(GPL) but lacked the full functionality of the version of elfutils licensed
under the Open Software License (OSL). In addition to the security fixes
listed below, this package provides a fully functional version of the
elfutils packages that are licensed under the GPL.

The version of elfutils licensed under the OSL could possibly crash while
parsing malformed input files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2005-1704](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1704) to this issue.

A non-security bug was found in the eu-strip application provided by the
elfutils package. When using eu-strip to separate the debugging information
from relocatable objects, eu-strip could occasionally create corrupted debug
files. The updated version of elfutils for this advisory contains a fix for
this bug.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0368.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with the RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 elfutils packages installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

PER EXISTING AGREEMENTS WITH AVAYA.

## 7. Revision History:

V 1.0 - August 31, 2006 - Initial Statement issued.

V 2.0 - January 24, 2008 - Removed Avaya Communication Manager from the list
of affected products, changed the Risk Level to None and set the Advisory Status
to Final.

# gdb: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200505-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU debugger,
potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/gdb** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.3-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.3-r3** |

### Background

gdb is the GNU project's debugger, facilitating the analysis and
debugging of applications. The BFD library provides a uniform method of
accessing a variety of object file formats.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered an
integer overflow in the BFD library, resulting in a heap overflow. A
review also showed that by default, gdb insecurely sources
initialisation files from the working directory.

### Impact

Successful exploitation would result in the execution of arbitrary code
on loading a specially crafted object file or the execution of
arbitrary commands.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All gdb users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/gdb-6.3-r3"
```
