- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `centericq` instant messenger client creates temporary files with predictable filenames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure temporary file creation, specifically predictable filenames, which allows for symlink attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local attackers can exploit this vulnerability through symlink attacks. The specific impact is not detailed, but could include file overwrite or unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks and have the ability to interact with the system where `centericq` is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the system running the vulnerable `centericq` software and be able to create symbolic links.
