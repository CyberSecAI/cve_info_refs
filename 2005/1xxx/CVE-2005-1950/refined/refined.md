Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `hints.pl` script in Webhints v1.03 is vulnerable to a remote command execution flaw. This is due to the script taking user input directly and executing it as a shell command. The script processes the input provided after the `?` in the URL.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation and sanitization. The script does not sanitize user-supplied data before passing it to the system shell.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable Webhints application, leading to complete compromise of the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `hints.pl` script, appending commands to be executed after a `?` character in the URL. The command is placed between the pipes `|`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any specific privileges or prior access to the system. All that is needed is the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. The attacker must know the location of the `hints.pl` script.

**Technical Details:**

The attacker injects commands into the URL parameter of the `hints.pl` script like this:
`www.example.com/hints.pl?|command|`

For example, to execute the `uname` command, the attacker would send this request:
`www.example.com/hints.pl?|uname|`

This vulnerability allows arbitrary command execution because the script passes the user-provided input directly to the shell.
