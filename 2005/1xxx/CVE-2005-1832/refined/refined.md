```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - Multiple parameters in MyBB do not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using them in generating URLs or SQL queries.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled parameters in URLs, allowing injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.
    - SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of the $eid parameter in calendar.php before using it in a database query. Multiple other SQL injection points are also present due to unsanitized user input.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - XSS: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement.
    - SQL Injection: Unauthorized access to the database, potentially allowing an attacker to read sensitive data (e.g., passwords), modify data, or gain administrative access.
- Attack vectors:
    - XSS: Sending crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript code as parameter values.
    - SQL Injection: Injecting malicious SQL code into vulnerable URL parameters.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - For both XSS and SQL Injection: The attacker only needs to be able to send a crafted URL to the vulnerable MyBB instance.
