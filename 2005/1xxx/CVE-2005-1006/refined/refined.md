  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization in the web interface of the SonicWALL SOHO/10 device.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Code Injection"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the user's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. An attacker can also inject code that is logged and executed when the administrator views the logs.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request containing script code",
        "Supplying a username containing script code at the login page, leading to code execution when viewing the logs"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the SonicWALL device's web interface. For the log file vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to authenticate, or be on the network to send authentication requests.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the web interface of the SonicWALL SOHO/10. Two attack vectors were identified: directly via HTTP GET and via the system logs. The system log vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the username field during login, leading to script code being logged and later executed when viewed. The length of script that can be injected is limited by client side constraints, but these can be bypassed by modifying the request with a proxy or manually crafting a POST request."
