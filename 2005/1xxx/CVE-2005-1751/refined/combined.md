The gen_tmpfile is used for tarball, subst, scpp ant path actions.  I think more issues could be found with this insecure temporary file creation  package ocan-mysql use also shtool, maybe more others packages use also shtool.

So, doesn't look to be abusable. Sorry for misinformation. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-24 10:45:03 UTC  ``` You were right first time, the rm then touch is a non-atomic operation, so  there's a race condition.  As the filename is easily predictable (pid-based), this is exploitable (in cases  like this you can cause lots of system load to expand the window even more,  using mktemp also contains a race condition, but to have any chance of  exploiting it you must create millions of files within a very short period  (microseconds?), so the attack is only theoretical, not practical). ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Aaron Walker (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-24 16:03:00 UTC  ``` 2.0.1-r1 in CVS; x86 stable.

Didn't get a return on that one, so I'm assuming it went through ok.  As far as packages using shtool, grep'ing the tree only turns up net-nds/openldap and dev-libs/mm.

Package        : php4
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-1751 CAN-2005-1921 CAN-2005-2498
Debian Bug     : 323366

Several security related problems have been found in PHP4, the
server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CAN-2005-1751

    Eric Romang discovered insecure temporary files in the shtool
    utility shipped with PHP that can exploited by a local attacker to
    overwrite arbitrary files.  Only this vulnerability affects
    packages in oldstable.

CAN-2005-1921

    GulfTech has discovered that PEAR XML_RPC is vulnerable to a
    remote PHP code execution vulnerability that may allow an attacker
    to compromise a vulnerable server.

CAN-2005-2498

    Stefan Esser discovered another vulnerability in the XML-RPC
    libraries that allows injection of arbitrary PHP code into eval()
    statements.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.2-7.woody5.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.10-16.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.0-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Eric Romang has discovered [[1]](#1) that GNU shtool [[0]](#0) insecurely creates
  temporary files with predictable filenames, potentially allowing a
  local user to overwrite arbitrary files with a "symlink" attack. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2005-1751 [[2]](#2) to the problem. On closer inspection, the Gentoo
  Security team discovered that the GNU shtool temporary file, once
  created, was being reused insecurely, too. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2005-1759 [[3]](#3) to the
  problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q shtool". If you have the "shtool" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [3][[4]](#4).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [[7]](#7) or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [[8]](#8), build a corresponding binary RPM from it [[3]](#3)
  and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [[5]](#5).
  For the affected release OpenPKG 2.3, perform the following operations
  to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
  accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.3/UPD
  ftp> get shtool-2.0.2-2.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig shtool-2.0.1-2.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild shtool-2.0.1-2.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/shtool-2.0.1-2.3.1.*.rpm

  Additionally, we recommend that you rebuild and reinstall
  all dependent packages (see above), if any, too [4][[5]](#5).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# GNU shtool, ocaml-mysql: Insecure temporary file creation — GLSA **200506-08**

GNU shtool and ocaml-mysql are vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially
allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-util/shtool** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.1-r2** |

| Package | **dev-ml/ocaml-mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3-r1** |

### Background

GNU shtool is a compilation of small shell scripts into a single
shell tool. The ocaml-mysql package includes the GNU shtool code.

### Description

Eric Romang has discovered that GNU shtool insecurely creates
temporary files with predictable filenames (CAN-2005-1751). On closer
inspection, Gentoo Security discovered that the shtool temporary file,
once created, was being reused insecurely (CAN-2005-1759).

### Impact

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary
files directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem.
When a GNU shtool script is executed, this would result in the file
being overwritten with the rights of the user running the script, which
could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GNU shtool users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/shtool-2.0.1-r2"
```

All ocaml-mysql users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-ml/ocaml-mysql-1.0.3-r1"
```
