Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-1174:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The MIT krb5 Key Distribution Center (KDC) implementation attempts to free memory at a random address when it receives a specific, though valid, request via a TCP connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double-Free:** The KDC attempts to free memory that has already been freed. The vulnerability is triggered in the TCP request handling code, specifically within `kill_tcp_connection()`. The code tries to free a buffer using a pointer that hasn't been properly initialized due to an error condition when processing a zero-component principal name. This leads to freeing memory at an arbitrary address on the heap.
- **Heap Corruption:** The double free leads to corruption of the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a crash of the KDC process, leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Although considered difficult, a successful exploitation *may* lead to arbitrary code execution on the KDC host.
- **Compromised Kerberos Realm:** By gaining code execution on the KDC host, an attacker could potentially compromise an entire Kerberos realm.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted Kerberos request to the KDC via TCP.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send TCP packets to the KDC.
- **Understanding of Kerberos:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a valid Kerberos request that triggers the vulnerability (a request with a zero-component principal name).

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability affects all MIT krb5 releases that support TCP client connections to the KDC, specifically krb5-1.3 and later releases, up to and including krb5-1.4.1.
-   The vulnerability is triggered when the KDC fails to find a principal with a zero-component name in its database.
-   The vulnerability can be avoided by disabling TCP support on the KDC.

**Mitigation:**
-   Apply patches provided by the vendor
-   Disable TCP support in KDC.
