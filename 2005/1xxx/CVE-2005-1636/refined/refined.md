Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of temporary files by the `mysql_install_db` script during the MySQL database creation process. Specifically, the script creates a temporary file in `/tmp` with a predictable filename (`/tmp/mysql_install_db.$$`) and insufficient permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The script uses a predictable filename and doesn't properly secure the temporary file, making it susceptible to manipulation by local attackers.
*   **Race Condition:**  A race condition exists between the creation of the temporary file and its subsequent use in the `eval` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A malicious local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:

*   **Inject Arbitrary SQL Commands:** By modifying the content of the temporary file before it's used by the `mysql_install_db` script, the attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands during database creation.
*   **Create Privileged MySQL Accounts:**  As a direct result of the above, an attacker could create a MySQL account with ALL privileges on all databases, effectively gaining full control over the MySQL server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where MySQL is being installed.
*   **File Manipulation:**  The attacker must be able to modify the temporary file in `/tmp` between its creation and use. This is possible if they are able to create their own file with a specific name before mysql does it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a user account on the system where MySQL is being installed.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to exploit the race condition to modify the temporary file in `/tmp` before the `mysql_install_db` script reads from it. This can be done by creating a read-only file with the same name as the tmp file to be created.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects MySQL versions prior to 4.0.12 and versions up to 5.0.4.
*   The vulnerable code involves the creation of the temporary file, writing "use mysql;" into it, and then using `cat` and `eval` to execute the SQL commands.
*   The vulnerability is considered low impact due to the narrow window of time for exploitation, however, if a user was not running mysql_install_db as root then it would be a higher risk.
*   The fix was to remove temp file usage in the script.
