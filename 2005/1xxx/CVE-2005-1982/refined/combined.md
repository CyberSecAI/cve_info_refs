## Microsoft PKINIT smart card logon vulnerable to information disclosure and spoofing

#### Vulnerability Note VU#477341

Original Release Date: 2005-11-09 | Last Revised: 2005-11-09

---

### Overview

Microsoft PKINIT smart card authentication is vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw that may allow an attacker to spoof a trusted server.

### Description

| From the Microsoft PKINIT description:   *PKINIT is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet Draft for "Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos." Windows 2000 and later uses draft 9 of the IETF "Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos" Internet Draft. Windows uses this protocol when you use a smart card for interactive logon. IETF Internet Drafts are available at the following* [*IETF Web site*](http://www.ietf.org/)*.* When PKINIT smart card authentication is used, an attacker may be able to inject themselves into an authentication session between a user and a domain controller and exploit this flaw. After exploiting the flaw, the attacker may spoof the application server to a target client. This flaw is due to a weakness in the older PKINIT protocol design specification that is implemented.Both the attacker and the target user must have their accounts enabled for smart card authentication. The attacker must already have valid logon credentials in order to successfully exploit the flaw. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, authenticated attacker that is able to intercept an authentication session between a user and domain controller may be able to gain confidential information and spoof a trusted application server to a targeted user. |

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in each âVulnerability Detailsâ sections of this bulletin, this update includes the following change in functionality: The security update that is provided addresses the externally-reported security vulnerabilities. However, a new optional but recommended registry key, RequireAsChecksum, has been added to provide additional protection to help protect against other potential PKINIT-related vulnerabilities. This registry key is documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Based Article 904766](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/904766). The REG\_DWORD registry value is in the following registry keys:

* On Windows XP:

  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\RequireAsChecksum`
* On Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003:

  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters\RequireAsChecksum`

**Note** You have to restart the system after you modify this registry key on a computer that is running Windows 2000. You do not have to restart the system after you modify this registry key on a computer that is running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003.

**Note** Enable this setting only after the security update has been installed on all domain controllers within a domain. Enabling this setting before the security update is deployed to domain controllers will cause smart card logon to fail.

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 ended on June 30, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a ended on December 31, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 have reached the end of their life cycles. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Kerberos Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1981:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted message to a Windows domain controller that could cause the service that is responsible for authenticating users in an Active Directory domain to stop responding.

#### Mitigating Factors for Kerberos Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1981:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.
* This vulnerability only affects Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 domain controllers. Servers that do not perform the role of domain controllers are not affected.
* Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP are not affected by this vulnerability.
* If an attacker successfully exploited this vulnerability, the affected system might display a warning that it would automatically restart after a 60-second countdown. At the end of this 60-second countdown, the affected system would automatically restart. After restart, the affected system would be restored to normal functionality. However, the affected system could be susceptible to another denial of service attack unless the update is applied.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for Kerberos Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1981:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Block UDP and TCP port 88 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with Kerberos. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports.

#### FAQ for Kerberos Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1981:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the server to automatically restart and, during that time, stop the server from responding to authentication requests. This vulnerability exists in systems that perform the role of a domain controller, such as Windows 2000 Server or Window Server 2003. The only effect on clients is that they may not be able to log on to the domain if their domain controller stops responding.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The method used by domain controllers to process specially crafted Kerberos messages.

**What is Kerberos?**

Windows 2000 and later operating system versions use Kerberos as the default authentication protocol. Kerberos provides secure user authentication. Also, because it is an industry standard, Kerberos permits interoperability." The Active Directory domain controller maintains user account and logon information to support the Kerberos service. For example, Kerberos is one protocol that is used to access data in [Active Directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21200). For more information about Kerberos, visit the following [Kerberos Authentication Explained Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/maintain/security/kerberos.mspx) or the [TechNet Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/security/news/kerb2000.mspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and the affected system to restart. The affected system might display a warning that it would automatically restart after a 60-second countdown. During this 60 second countdown, local authentication at the console of the affected system and user domain authentication with the affected system would not be possible. At the end of this 60-second countdown, the affected system would automatically restart. If users cannot perform domain authentication with the affected system, they might not be able to access domain resources. After restart, the affected system would be restored to normal functionality. However, the affected system could be susceptible to another denial of service attack unless the update is applied. Even if a domain controller were completely unavailable, it would not prevent users who already had Kerberos tickets from using them. They could continue accessing all resources for which they had already been granted tickets. However, it would prevent the domain controller from issuing any new tickets to allow access to other resources.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any authenticated user who could deliver the specially crafted Kerberos message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message to the domain controllers in a single forest or multiple forests, potentially causing a denial of service to domain authentication throughout an enterprise. This could cause the affected systems to stop responding and cause the affected systems to restart.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Only Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003 domain controllers are vulnerable.

**I am running Windows 2000 Server or Windows Server 2003. What systems do I have to update?**

The update to address this vulnerability must be installed on systems that are used as domain controllers. However, the update can be safely installed on servers in other roles. We recommend that you install this update on systems that might install Active Directory in the future.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT professionals can visit the [Security Guidance Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Kerberos processes the specially crafted message.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### PKINIT Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1982:

This is an information disclosure and spoofing vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to tamper with certain information that is sent from a domain controller and potentially access sensitive client network communication. Users could believe they are accessing a trusted server when in reality they are accessing a malicious server. However, an attacker would first have to inject themselves into the middle of an authentication session between a client and a domain controller.

#### Mitigating Factors for PKINIT Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1982:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able inject themselves into the middle of an authentication session between a client and a domain controller to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.
* An attacker can spoof an application server only to a target client for which the attacker has been granted permissions to access.
* The account that is used by an attacker and the account that is used by the target of this attack would have to have their accounts enabled for smart card authentication. For more information about the required steps to enable smart card use within your enterprise, visit the following [Web site](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/b989f4fd-febd-42e1-a130-9e0f33800734).
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the target user.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for PKINIT Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1982:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

Windows 2000 and later operating system versions use Kerberos as the default authentication protocol. Kerberos provides secure user authentication. Also, because it is an industry standard, Kerberos permits interoperability." The Active Directory domain controller maintains user account and logon information to support the Kerberos service. For example, Kerberos is one protocol that is used to access data in [Active Directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21200). For more information about Kerberos, visit the following [Kerberos Authentication Explained Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/maintain/security/kerberos.mspx) or the [TechNet Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/security/news/kerb2000.mspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to access sensitive information and spoof a domain controller. This could allow an attacker to view encrypted network communication that is sent between the client and the original destination.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able inject themselves into the middle of an authentication session between a client and a domain controller to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any domains where smart cards are actively in use could be at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that PKINIT validates the data received.
**Note** In a domain environment, domain controllers and domain clients must install the security update to help protect against the PKINIT vulnerability.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been broadly publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB899587\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 899587 security update into the Windows installation source files.
