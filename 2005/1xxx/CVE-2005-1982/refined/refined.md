Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1982:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the design specification of the older PKINIT protocol implementation used in Microsoft Windows when smart card authentication is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is an information disclosure and spoofing flaw. It allows an attacker to intercept and tamper with data exchanged between a client and a domain controller during PKINIT authentication using smart cards.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially access sensitive network communication between a client and a server.
- Spoofing: An attacker can spoof a trusted application server to a targeted user by injecting themselves into the authentication session and tampering with the information. The target user may believe they are accessing a legitimate server while being connected to a malicious one.
- The attacker gains the same user rights as the target user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack involves intercepting an authentication session between a user and a domain controller during PKINIT smart card authentication. The attacker must inject themselves into this session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid logon credentials in the domain.
- The attacker must be able to inject themselves into an authentication session between a user and a domain controller.
- Both the attacker's and the target user's accounts must be enabled for smart card authentication.
- The attacker must have permission to access the target client.
