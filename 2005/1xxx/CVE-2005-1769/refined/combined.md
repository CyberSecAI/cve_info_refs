We're sending it here to give you some advance notice to prepare for this if you want to. Sorry for the short notice but this was mainly caused by the finding of some additional issues.  - It contains fixes for several cross site scripting attacks, most by URL manipulation, and some by sending a specially crafted HTML email. - The attached patch is tentative; further testing or further revealed issues may warrant changes between now and the release. - The patch is made against the 1.4.4-release version of SquirrelMail. - Please do not disclose information about this vulnerability until Wednesday. - Credits to many of the findings go to Martijn Brinkers.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=163047#c1)  John Dalbec    2005-07-21 14:45:46 UTC  ``` 05.28.27 CVE: [CAN-2005-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-2095) Platform: Web Application Title: SquirrelMail Unspecified Variable Handling Vulnerability Description: SquirrelMail is a Web mail application It is affected by an unspecified variable-handling vulnerability.

Anyone have any thoughts on how to patch this?  I see that before we actually updated to a newer source.  That may be a good idea, but it could eventually cause problems if, for example, they start using newer PHP features that we don't have available in our versions of PHP.  I could backport the patches to 1.4.3, but it looks like that would be rather time consuming, so I thought I should ask first.  If we end up using the provided patches (instead of updating to newer source) I've created an updated package for FC2 using the patches provided at squirrelmail's website since I didn't need to make any changes to them for the FC2 package.  <http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~jeff/legacy/squirrelmail-1.4.4-1.FC2.1.legacy.src.rpm> 5932f9f2239d759bb3e4f5d9ed1e5b831ae0fd87  squirrelmail-1.4.4-1.FC2.1.legacy.src.rpm -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.1 (Darwin)  iD8DBQFC5wVyKe7MLJjUbNMRAsvoAJ41J3/On+W6Lv9aDL3FoOTLbvDcCwCgl6hN 95iDEKPuMxItq2SSfVGk8Oc= =bIGt -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=163047#c3)  Pekka Savola    2005-07-27 06:58:06 UTC  ``` FWIW, I'd be inclined to update to 1.4.5, as it's likely that getting QA would be easier -- unless it's trivial to verify the correctness of patches (it often isn't).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=163047#c4)  Marc Deslauriers    2005-07-27 12:07:26 UTC  ``` We have to wait until updates come out for fc3 to make sure we don't break the upgrade path.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=163047#c5)  Jeff Sheltren    2005-08-03 21:24:59 UTC  ``` -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Here are the RH9 and FC1 packages (based on RHEL3 patches)  <http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~jeff/legacy/squirrelmail-1.4.3-0.f0.9.4.legacy.src.rpm> b224417bf482a9bc24a113e386cd8d804f4fd54d  squirrelmail-1.4.3-0.f0.9.4.legacy.src.rpm  <http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~jeff/legacy/squirrelmail-1.4.3-0.f1.1.3.legacy.src.rpm> d45d104f0381b980858341a2b6f56084ff318a2c  squirrelmail-1.4.3-0.f1.1.3.legacy.src.rpm -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.1 (Darwin)  iD8DBQFC8TXEKe7MLJjUbNMRAtQmAKDMH9FrlIu9h7/tAodWichJiCMsBQCghVoy Xs7PbHKkeZMULhMFqXeA8is= =OdHi -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=163047#c6)  Jeff Sheltren    2005-08-05 15:04:09 UTC  ``` -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  There was a problem with the EL3 [CAN-2005-1769](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-1769) patch which broke the addressbook (see [bug #165094](show_bug.cgi?id=165094 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - addressbook.php error")) I have updated the packages to use the newer patch.

Package        : squirrelmail
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CAN-2005-1769 CAN-2005-2095
Debian Bug     : 314374 317094

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squirrelmail, a
commonly used webmail system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-1769

    Martijn Brinkers discovered cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
    that allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
    in the URL and e-mail messages.

CAN-2005-2095

    James Bercegay of GulfTech Security discovered a vulnerability in
    the variable handling which could lead to attackers altering other
    people's preferences and possibly reading them, writing files at
    any location writable for www-data and cross site scripting.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-4.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-6sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-6sarge1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
