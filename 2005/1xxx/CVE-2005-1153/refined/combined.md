# Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200504-18**

New Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Suite releases fix new security
vulnerabilities, including memory disclosure and various ways of executing
JavaScript code with elevated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.7** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.7** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that includes a
mail and news reader. Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation browser
from the Mozilla project.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla Suite
and Mozilla Firefox:

* Vladimir V. Perepelitsa reported a memory disclosure bug in
  JavaScript's regular expression string replacement when using an
  anonymous function as the replacement argument (CAN-2005-0989).
* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 discovered that Chrome UI code was overly trusting DOM
  nodes from the content window, allowing privilege escalation via DOM
  property overrides.
* Michael Krax reported a possibility to run JavaScript code with
  elevated privileges through the use of javascript: favicons.
* Michael Krax also discovered that malicious Search plugins could
  run JavaScript in the context of the displayed page or stealthily
  replace existing search plugins.
* shutdown discovered a technique to pollute the global scope of a
  window in a way that persists from page to page.
* Doron Rosenberg discovered a possibility to run JavaScript with
  elevated privileges when the user asks to "Show" a blocked popup that
  contains a JavaScript URL.
* Finally, Georgi Guninski reported missing Install object instance
  checks in the native implementations of XPInstall-related JavaScript
  objects.

The following Firefox-specific vulnerabilities have also been
discovered:

* Kohei Yoshino discovered a new way to abuse the sidebar panel to
  execute JavaScript with elevated privileges.
* Omar Khan reported that the Plugin Finder Service can be tricked to
  open javascript: URLs with elevated privileges.

### Impact

The various JavaScript execution with elevated privileges issues can be
exploited by a remote attacker to install malicious code or steal data.
The memory disclosure issue can be used to reveal potentially sensitive
information. Finally, the cache pollution issue and search plugin abuse
can be leveraged in cross-site-scripting attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.3"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.3"
```

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.7"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.7"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Happens on trunk too, Seamonkey and Firefox.
Steps:
- popup is blocked
- Showing it (via infobar or statusbar item) will print Components.Stack, a
nono.

So should we start considering doing a security smoketest for releases?

"start considering"???
You \_should\_ be doing regression testing of all security fixes. In an automated
fashion, ideally, on every nightly. Preferably as part of the tinderbox tests so
it goes orange when a security thing like this regresses.

I'm actually not convinced this was fixed. A very similar problem was fixed, but
I think this one simply slipped through the cracks and noone noticed (or at
least told us) until now. Patch coming up.

>+ stack->Push(cx);
stack->Push(cx) is treated as fallible in many of our other calls. Seems like
we should
early-out if this fails, since we can be in a world of hurt. (This world of
hurt,
specifically.)

Hi Doron,
Would you please compose a new test case for mozilla? With this case you
provided here I can't reproduce this bug on mozilla/linux while the os of this
bug is set to all. Please send it to tim.miao@sun.com.
Thanks.

In Seamonkey, just go to the testcase, right click on the buttom-right (in the
statusbar) icon for the blocked popup, and choose "Show blabla".

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-35

## Showing blocked javascript: popup uses wrong privilege context

Announced
April 15, 2005
Reporter
Doron Rosenberg
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.3
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.7

### Description

When a popup is blocked the user is given the ability to open that one popup
through the popup-blocking status bar icon and, in Firefox, through
the infobar. If the popup URL were javascript: selecting "Show javascript:..."
from the infobar or popup blocking status bar icon menus would run the
javascript with elevated privileges which could be used to install malicious
software.

### Workaround

Do not show blocked popups, or, if you must, show individual popups
only if the menu item starts with "Show http://" or "Show https://"

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
