Hi b0iler,

There is a problem with original advisory on security.lss.hr site.  Vulnerable
PHP line itself is presented as HTML tag so it isn't visible within browser.
That's why the rest of the advisory doesn't make any sense.

Here it is:
--------------
..
<?php
		if(file_exists($form.".toolbar.inc.php")) {
			include($form.".toolbar.inc.php");
		}
?>
..
..
<?php include($form.".form.inc.php");?>    <- HERE IT IS
..
--------------

I apologize for that mistake, we will fix that in a few hours.
