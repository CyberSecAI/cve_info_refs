Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2005-1978:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way COM+ (Component Object Model Plus) creates and uses memory structures. Specifically, there's a flaw in the process COM+ employs for allocating and managing memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Management Flaw:** An unchecked memory operation within COM+ allows for exploitation.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on affected systems.
*  **Local Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability can be leveraged to gain administrative privileges on affected systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Control:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker complete control over the affected system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can run arbitrary code on the system.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can view, change, or delete data.
*   **Account Creation:** Attackers can create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** On Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP1, an attacker can remotely send a specially crafted network message to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Local Attack (Privilege Escalation):** On Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2003 SP1, an attacker needs to log on locally and execute a malicious program to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **DCOM Exploitation:** In some cases, the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) may be used to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Windows 2000 and XP SP1:**
    *   An attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They need to be able to send a specially crafted network message to the vulnerable system.
*   **Windows XP SP2, Server 2003, and Server 2003 SP1:**
    *   An attacker needs to be authenticated and must have local access to execute the malicious code.
    *   Remote exploitation is only possible if the attacker already possesses administrative permissions on the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was privately reported, not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
*   Microsoft had not received reports of the vulnerability being actively exploited before issuing the bulletin, although the content mentions that the vulnerability is being actively exploited.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by modifying how COM+ creates and uses internal memory structures.
*   Mitigations like disabling COM+, blocking specific ports at the firewall, disabling DCOM and using personal firewalls can help reduce the risk.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 1, and "Important" for Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.
