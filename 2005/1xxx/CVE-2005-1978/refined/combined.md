**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin, this update includes the following changes in security functionality. These registry keys are documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Based Article 908620](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/908620)

* The TIP protocol has been disabled on Windows 2000. To enable this protocol, set the value of the following registry entry to 1. If this registry entry does not exist, or if the value of this registry entry is set to 0, TIP is disabled. This is a new registry key on Windows 2000. You cannot directly disable TIP before you install this security update.

  `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSDTC\Security\NetworkDtcAccessTip`
* To help reduce the impact of future TIP related vulnerabilities, four additional registry values have been created.

  + DisableTipTmIdVerfication. If this registry entry does not exist, or if the value of this registry entry is set to 0, packets are blocked when the TM ID does not match the IP address of the sending computer. If the value of this registry entry is set to 1, packets are accepted from any IP address.

    `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSDTC\DisableTipTmIdVerification`
  + DisableTipTmIdPortVerification. If this registry entry does not exist, or if the value of this registry entry is set to 0, packets are blocked when they do not specify 3372 as the port. If the value of this registry entry is set to 1, packets are accepted from any port.

    `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSDTC\DisableTipTmIdPortVerification`
  + DisableTipBeginCheck. If this registry entry does not exist, or if the value of this registry entry is set to 0, TIP âBEGINâ commands are always blocked. If the value of this registry entry is set to 1, TIP âBEGINâ commands are always accepted.

    `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSDTC\DisableTipBeginCheck`
  + DisableTipPassThruCheck. If this registry entry does not exist, or if the value of this registry entry is set to 0, TIP âPULLâ commands are rejected for transactions that were pushed to the computer and that did not perform any local work on the transaction. If the value of this registry entry is set to 1, TIP âPULLâ commands are accepted for transactions that were pushed to the computer and that did not perform any local work on the transaction.

    `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSDTC\DisableTipPassThruCheck`

**Note** You do not have to restart the system after you modify these registry keys. However, you do have to restart the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) service.

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 ended on June 30, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a ended on December 31, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 have reached the end of their life cycles. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Details

#### MSDTC Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2119:

A remote code execution and [local elevation of privilege](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for MSDTC Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2119:

* Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 systems are not vulnerable to this issue.
* By default, on Windows Server 2003, the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator is started, but it is not configured to support Network DTC Access. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. However, if an administrator has enabled support for Network DTC Access, Windows Server 2003 systems could be vulnerable to remote code execution attacks by anonymous users. For information about how to configure Network DTC Access, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms680682.aspx).
* By default, on Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows 2000 Professional, the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator is not started. This service must be running to enable the remote attack vector. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. However, any local user can start this service unless the service has been disabled by an administrator. As soon as this service is started, Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems could be vulnerable to remote code execution attacks by anonymous users. This is because on Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems, the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator service is configured to allow Network DTC Access. For information about how to configure Network DTC Access, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms680682.aspx).
* For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for MSDTC Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2119:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

  Disabling the Distributed Transaction Coordinator helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. Alternatively, click Start, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Component Services**.
  4. Click **Services**.
  5. Double-click **Distributed Transaction Coordinator**.
  6. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  7. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.

  You can also stop and disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator by using the following command at the command prompt:

  `sc stop MSDTC & sc config MSDTC start= disabled`

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, you cannot use any service or application that is dependant on the Distributed Transaction Coordinator. This could include other applications such as SQL Server, BizTalk Server, Exchange Server, or Message Queuing. Also, this service is required in most clustering configurations. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot install the security update.
* **Use the Group Policy settings to disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator on all affected systems that do not require this feature.**

  Because the Distributed Transaction Coordinator is a possible attack vector, disable it by using the Group Policy settings. You can disable the startup of this service at the local, site, domain, or organizational unit level by using Group Policy object functionality in Windows 2000 domain environments or in Windows Server 2003 domain environments. For more information about how to disable this service through logon scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 297789](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/297789)

  **Note** You may also review the [Windows 2000 Security Hardening Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=15e83186-a2c8-4c8f-a9d0-a0201f639a56&displaylang;=en). This guide includes information about how to disable services.

  For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Web sites:

  + [Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding the Group Policy Feature Set](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/stepbystep/gpfeat.mspx)
  + [Windows 2000 Group Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/howto/grpolwt.mspx)
  + [Group Policy in Windows Server 2003](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/gp/default.mspx)

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, you cannot use any service or application that is dependant on the Distributed Transaction Coordinator. This could include other applications such as SQL Server, BizTalk Server, Exchange Server, or Message Queuing. Also, this service is required in most clustering configurations. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot install the security update.
* **Disable Network DTC Access**

  If you cannot install the security update, and you cannot disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, you may want to disable Network DTC Access. This option is only available on Windows XP and later operating system versions. This still allows local transactions to complete, but it helps protect from network based attacks that try to exploit this issue. For information about how to configure Network DTC Access, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms680682.aspx). To disable Network DTC Access, follow these steps:

  **Warning** Performing this procedure causes the affected service to start if it was not started previously. Stop the MSDTC service on the MSDTC tab before you close the configuration dialog boxes.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel.** Alternatively, click **Start**, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-Click **Component Services**, expand **Component Services**, expand **Computers**, right-click **My Computer** and then click **Properties**,
  4. Click the **MSDTC** tab, and then click **Security Configuration.**
  5. In the **Security Configuration** dialog box, click to clear the **Network DTC Access** check box.

     **Note** This sets the following DWORD registry entry to 0 on non-clustering environments. Clustering environments do not read the following registry key. For Clustering environments, follow the steps that are listed in the âDisable the Distributed Transaction Coordinatorâ bullet point.

     `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSDTC\Security\NetworkDtcAccess`

     **Note** You can also apply this setting to multiple systems by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/stepbystep/gpfeat.mspx).
  6. Click **OK**, close the **Component Services** dialog box, and then close the **Administrative Tools** dialog box.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable Network DTC Access, distributed transaction could fail. This could impact other applications such as SQL Server, BizTalk Server, or Message Queuing. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot install the security update.
* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024**
  + **Any other specifically configured RPC port**

  These ports can be used to initiate a connection with MSDTC. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically-configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. While RPC can use UDP ports 135, 137, 138, 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593, the MSDTC service is not vulnerable over those ports.

  **Note** Other protocols, such as Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) or NetBEUI, could be used to communicate with the MSDTC service. If you are using these protocols, you should block the appropriate ports for those protocols. For more information about IPX and SPX, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/reskit/prch_cnn_goue.asp).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**. (Windows Sever 2003 displays this as **Network Connections**)
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Under **Windows Firewall**, click **Settings.**
  6. Click **On,** and then click **OK**.
  7. Click the **Exceptions** tab. You may need to click **Settings** to display the exceptions tab.
  8. Verify that MSDTC.exe is not in the list of firewall exceptions, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPsec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPsec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878). RPC uses a broad range of ports, which may make it difficult to try to secure them all by using IPsec. [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 908472](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/908472) documents how to restrict RPC communication to a set of fixed ports and how to secure those ports by using IPsec.

#### FAQ for MSDTC Vulnerability - CAN-2005-2119:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

On Windows 2000 this is a remote code execution vulnerability. On Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003 this is a [local privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. On Windows XP Service Pack 1, this also becomes a remote code execution vulnerability if the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator is started. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator.

**What is the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator?**

The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) is a distributed transaction facility for Microsoft Windows platforms. MSDTC uses proven transaction processing technology. It is robust despite system failures, process failures, and communication failures; it exploits loosely coupled systems to provide scalable performance; and it is easy to install, configure, and manage. The DTC service provides the following benefits:

* Reduces the cost of enterprise computing.
  The DTC provides a sophisticated, low-cost distributed transaction facility for users of networked, commodity-priced PCs and servers.
* Simplifies application development.
  DTC transactions greatly simplify the application task of preserving consistency, despite failures that can occur when updating application data.
* Provides a consistent transaction model.
  The DTC supports a variety of resource managers, including relational databases, object-oriented databases, file systems, document storage systems, and message queues.
* Enables software development using distributed software components.
  The DTC provides a simple, object-oriented application programming interface for initiating and controlling transactions.

For information about MSDTC, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms679938.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

On Windows 2000, any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted network message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability. On Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003, an attacker must be able to log on locally to a system and run a program to try to exploit the vulnerability. Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003 are not vulnerable to remote anonymous attack in default scenarios. User configuration is required on these operating system versions in order to create the possibility of remote attack. If attacked locally, an attacker could then run a specially-crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and gain complete control over the affected system.

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for COM+ Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1978:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable COM+**

  Disabling COM+ helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. There are different ways to disable COM+, depending on which platform you are using.

  **Important** This bulletin contains information about how to modify the registry. Make sure to back up the registry before you modify it. Make sure that you know how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up, restore, and modify the registry, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 256986](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986).
  **Warning** Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved. Modify the registry at your own risk.

  + On Windows 2000, create a file that is named ~clbcatq.dll in the %windir%\system32 folder. These steps create a similar environment as the issue that is discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Based Article 246499](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/246499). To disable COM+ on Windows 2000, follow these steps:

    1. Logon as an administrator.
    2. Click **Start,** and then click **Run** and then type:

       `echo âWorkaround for KB902400â >%windir%\system32\~clbcatq.dll`
    3. Restart the system.
       **Note** To re-enable COM+, delete the ~clbcatq.dll file and restart the system.
  + To disable COM+ on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, create a registry key and restart the computer to disable COM+:

    On these operating system versions you can create a registry key and restart the machine to disable COM+.

    1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedt32**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
    2. In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key:

       `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\COM3`
    3. Double-click the COM+Enabled registry entry, and then change the value to 0.
       **Note** Make a note of the current value so that you can reverse this procedure if required.
    4. Quit Registry Editor and restart the system.
    - Alternatively, you can paste the following text into a .reg file. Then, double-click the .reg file while you are logged on locally as an administrator:

      `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\COM3]"Com+Enabled"=dword:00000000`

      **Note** You can also apply this setting to multiple systems by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following [Microsoft Web Site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/stepbystep/gpfeat.mspx).

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable COM+, you cannot use any COM+ dependant applications. Customers should evaluate whether any business-critical applications rely on COM+ services before they deploy these workarounds. We recommend these workaround only on systems that cannot install the security update. For information about COM+, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms685978.aspx).
* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593**
  + **If installed, COM Internet Services (CIS) or RPC over HTTP, which listen on ports 80 and 443**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with RPC. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports that RPC uses, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312). For more information about how to disable CIS, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 825819](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/825819).

  **Note** Other protocols, such as Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) or NetBEUI, could be used to communicate with the MSDTC service. If you are using these protocols, you should block the appropriate ports for those protocols. For more information about IPX and SPX, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/reskit/prch_cnn_goue.asp).
* **Disable DCOM**
  Disabling DCOM helps protect the affected system from remote attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, the affected system could still be vulnerable to local elevation of privilege attacks that try to exploit this vulnerability. For instructions on how to disable DCOM, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 825750](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/825750).

  As an alternative to the steps that are documented In [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 825750](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/825750), alternately you can paste the following text into a .reg file. Then, double-click the .reg file while you are logged on locally as an administrator:

  `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ole]"EnableDCOM"="N"`

  **Note** You can also apply this setting to multiple systems by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following [Microsoft Web Site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/stepbystep/gpfeat.mspx).

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable DCOM, you cannot use any DCOM dependant applications. Customers should evaluate whether any business critical applications rely on DCOM services before you deploy this workaround. There are potentially many built-in components and third-party applications that are affected if you disable DCOM. We do not recommend that you disable DCOM in your environment until you have tested to discover what applications are affected. Disabling DCOM may not be possible in all environments. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot install the security update. For information about disabling DCOM, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 825750](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/825750).

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process that the Distributed Transaction Coordinator uses to validate TIP requests.

**What is the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator?**

The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) is a distributed transaction facility for Microsoft Windows platforms. MSDTC uses proven transaction processing technology. It is robust despite system failures, process failures, and communication failures; it exploits loosely coupled systems to provide scalable performance; and it is easy to install, configure, and manage. The DTC service provides the following benefits:

* Reduces the cost of enterprise computing.
  The DTC provides a sophisticated, low-cost distributed transaction facility for users of networked, commodity-priced PCs and servers.
* Simplifies application development.
  DTC transactions greatly simplify the application task of preserving consistency, despite failures that can occur when updating application data.
* Provides a consistent transaction model.
  The DTC supports a variety of resource managers, including relational databases, object-oriented databases, file systems, document storage systems, and message queues.
* Enables software development using distributed software components.
  The DTC provides a simple, object-oriented application programming interface for initiating and controlling transactions.

For information about MSDTC, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms679938.aspx).

**What is TIP?**

MSDTC supports Transaction Internet Protocol (TIP). TIP transactions implicitly assume a two-pipe architecture. In this architecture, messages that describe the work flow on one pipe, the application-to-application pipe, and messages that control the transaction flow on another pipe, the transaction manager-to-transaction manager pipe. MS DTC selects TIP when an application program or resource manager explicitly uses the TIP COM interfaces. MS DTC also uses TIP when TIP is the only communication protocol that is common to both platforms. TIP is typically used when MS DTC is used in conjunction with transaction managers from other companies. For more information about TIP, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms682773.aspx). TIP is an IETF standard, documented at the following [IETF Web site](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2371.txt).

TIP is an IETF standard, documented at the following [IETF Web site](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2371.txt). For more information about security considerations that are associated with TIP, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms681242.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected service to stop responding on the affected systems. This specially crafted message could also be transferred through the affected system to another TIP server and cause that systems MSDTC to stop responding.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

When the TIP protocol is available, any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted network message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted network message and sending the message to an affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows 2000 based versions of the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator are primarily at risk from this vulnerability because TIP is enabled by default. If TIP is manually enabled on other operating system versions, they would be equally vulnerable to this issue.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT professionals can visit the [Security Guidance Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that MSDTC validates TIP requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**

The update for this issue will be included in future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log: path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows Server 2003:

**Windowsserver2003-kb902400-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB902400.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows Server 2003:

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

Arpidfix.exe is used by the security update installer to address an issue documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 904630](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/904630). This file is not installed onto the affected system.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP2\KB902400\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 902400 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows XP (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

This security update requires Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1 or a later version. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 322389](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389).

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**

The update for this issue will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Microsoft Windows XP:

**Windowsxp-kb902400-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB902400.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows XP:

**Windowsxp-kb902400-x86-enu /norestart**

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

Arpidfix.exe is used by the security update installer to address an issue documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 904630](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/904630). This file is not installed onto the affected system.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB902400\Filelist

  For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB902400\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 902400 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows 2000 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

For Windows 2000, this security update requires Service Pack 4 (SP4). For Small Business Server 2000, this security update requires Small Business Server 2000 Service Pack 1a (SP1a) or Small Business Server 2000 running with Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 (SP4).

The software that is listed has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**

The update for this issue may be included in a future Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB902400\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 902400 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft COM+ contains a memory management flaw

#### Vulnerability Note VU#950516

Original Release Date: 2005-10-11 | Last Revised: 2005-12-15

---

### Overview

Microsoft COM+ contains a vulnerability due to a memory management flaw that may allow an attacker to take complete control of an affected system.

### Description

| Microsoft gives the following definition of COM+:   *COM+ is the next step in the evolution of the Microsoft Component Object Model and Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS). COM+ handles resource management tasks, such as thread allocation and security. It automatically makes applications more scalable by providing thread pooling, object pooling, and just-in-time object activation. COM+ also helps protect the integrity of data by providing transaction support even if a transaction spans multiple databases over a network. For information about COM+, visit the following* [*Microsoft Web site*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cossdk/html/b21a6b08-c17c-4fcc-bc60-39037bc9902f.asp)*.*  Microsoft COM+ contains a flaw in the process used to create and utilize memory that may allow an attacker to take complete control of a system. The attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the system and take control of it by sending a specially-crafted network packet to the system.Note that Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP1 systems are primarily at risk. Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 (including SP1) are only vulnerable to a local, authenticated attacker exploiting this flaw. This vulnerability is being actively exploited. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
