# webapp-config: Insecure temporary file handling — GLSA **200506-13**

The webapp-config utility insecurely creates temporary files in a world
writable directory, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary
commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/webapp-config** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.11** |

### Background

webapp-config is a Gentoo Linux utility to help manage the installation
of web-based applications.

### Description

Eric Romang discovered webapp-config uses a predictable temporary
filename while processing certain options, resulting in a race
condition.

### Impact

Successful exploitation of the race condition would allow an attacker
to disrupt the operation of webapp-config, or execute arbitrary shell
commands with the privileges of the user running webapp-config. A local
attacker could use a symlink attack to create or overwrite files with
the permissions of the user running webapp-config.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All webapp-config users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/webapp-config-1.11"
```
### References

* [CVE-2005-1707](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1707)

**Release date**

June 17, 2005

**Latest revision**

December 30, 2007: 03

**Severity**

normal

**Exploitable**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Ilian Zarov    2002-01-08 19:01:06 UTC  ``` Hello, attached is multi-gnome-terminal-1.3.8.ebuild. (<http://multignometerm.sourceforge.net>): Multi GNOME Terminal is an enhanced  version of gnome-terminal which has the following features added:     Many terminals in each window     Switch between terminals using shortcuts     Execution of user defined commands in new terminals     Notification of terminal states (changed, changing, unchanged) using different tabs colors     Reorderable tabs  I suggest app-misc/multi-gnome-terminal for this package.      Best Regards,     Ilian Zarov ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Ilian Zarov    2002-01-08 19:03:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 30](attachment.cgi?id=30 "multi-gnome-terminal-1.3.8.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=30&action=edit "multi-gnome-terminal-1.3.8.ebuild")] multi-gnome-terminal-1.3.8.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-08 19:08:57 UTC  ``` multi-gnome-terminal is already in portage (x11-term/multi-gnome-terminal), updated from 1.3.7 to 1.3.8 though.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Ilian Zarov    2002-01-08 19:36:10 UTC  ```  I just noticed that the settings menu is not working. Sorry. Here's the corrected version (note: I used cp to copy a default configuration file - multi-gnome-terminal.glade, because the file should be in /usr/share/gnome-terminal/glade - configuration directory of gnome-terminal). ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Ilian Zarov    2002-01-08 19:44:35 UTC  ``` There was a problem with creating a new attachment (No file was provided, or it was empty) though it was there. Put a tab in front of cp :) --- multi-gnome-terminal-1.3.8-r1.ebuild # Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, v2 or later # Author: Ilian Zarov <coder@descom.com>  S=${WORKDIR}/${P} SRC_URI="[http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/multignometerm/${P}.tar.bz2](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/multignometerm/%24%7BP%7D.tar.bz2)" HOMEPAGE="<http://multignometerm.sf.net>" DESCRIPTION="MGT is an enchanced version of gnome-terminal with many terminals in each window support ala konsole"  DEPEND=">=x11-libs/gtk+-1.2.10 	>=gnome-base/gnome-libs-1.0.59 	>=media-libs/gdk-pixbuf-0.7.0 	>=gnome-base/libglade-0.17-r1         >=app-text/scrollkeeper-0.2         >=gnome-base/ORBit-0.5.10-r1"  src_unpack() {         unpack ${A}         cd ${S} cp gnome-terminal/multi-gnome-terminal.glade /usr/share/gnome-terminal/glade }  src_compile() { 	./configure --prefix=/usr --host=${CHOST} 	\ 	--build=${CHOST} 	emake || die }  src_install() { 	make prefix=${D} install || die } ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-08 19:49:01 UTC  ``` multi-gnome-term 1.3.8 is already in portage. (I upgraded it before).  Also, you should never do   cp gnome-terminal/multi-gnome-terminal.glade /usr/share/gnome-terminal/glade  in src_unpack (this makes it copy a file directly to the filesystem without being installed the correct way).  Anyway, just use the .ebuild that already in x11-misc/multi-gnome-term, it works.    ``` |  |

Another webapp-fixperms invocation:    # /usr/sbin/webapp-fixperms -p -d /var/www2 all   # /usr/sbin/webapp-fixperms -d /var/www2 all  (-p and --pretend are much like emerge's pretend mode.)  The combination will check permission on installed config files for all webapps found in /var/www{,2}/*/htdocs.  You can also replace the 'all' target with a specific package name, or names, and it will fix the permissions on only those webapp installs.  There's a few other little things, though they'll be properly documented in a man page shortly.  /me gets back to rolling 1.10-r15 .. :) ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  Elfyn McBratney (beu) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-15 09:49:20 UTC  ``` InCVS, though p.mask'd as I have to go off for a few hours, and there's still a buglet remaining .. however, the the webapp-config bump has better error messages, permissions checks and all options bar --fix-toplevel-vhost-perms-only are working perfectly, from my _hours_ of testing ;)  Will get the last bug I know fixed when I get back and un p.mask then .. ```  [Comment 26](#c26)  Elfyn McBratney (beu) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-15 12:51:19 UTC  ``` Okay, I'm back ;) - -r15 will be taken out of p.mask and unleashed within the hour .. </bugspam> ;p ```  [Comment 27](#c27)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-16 05:32:20 UTC  ``` Woops still package masked->back to ebuild status. ```  [Comment 28](#c28)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-17 11:55:58 UTC  ``` Are you sure to fix the correct directories and don't go wild on the tree? >> [Bug 92958](show_bug.cgi?id=92958 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - permissions of /dev/ files wrong") ```  [Comment 29](#c29)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-20 10:28:51 UTC  ``` Elfyn,  I don't get it, -r15 was removed ?

Assuming I haven't missed anything, it  includes fixes for all the security bugs discovered against webapp-config 1.10- r11 or -r12.  v1.11 isn't marked stable yet - it needs wider testing before we  can do that.  Hopefully I'll have some feedback in a couple of days.  I've removed webapp-config v1.10-r14 from the tree.  It was too broken, sorry.
