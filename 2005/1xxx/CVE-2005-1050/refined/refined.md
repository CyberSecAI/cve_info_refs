The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PostNuke 0.760-RC3, including SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and path disclosure.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data before being used in SQL queries or displayed on the webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    - The `sid` parameter in `modules.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    - Specifically, when loading the `News` module, the `sid` parameter is directly injected into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - The `module` parameter in `admin.php` and the `op` parameter in `user.php` are vulnerable to XSS.
    - Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into these parameters, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

3.  **Path Disclosure:**
    - The `id` parameter in `modules.php` when loading the `Reviews` module is vulnerable to path disclosure.
    - By injecting a single quote into this parameter, a PHP error is triggered, revealing the server's file system path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    - Attackers can potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database.
    - In this case, the error message shows that an SQL error occurred which indicates the vulnerability is exploitable, and could lead to data breach.

2.  **XSS:**
    - Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    - This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions performed under the context of the user's account.
    - In this case the proof of concept displays a cookie alert box.

3.  **Path Disclosure:**
    - Attackers can obtain sensitive information about the server's file structure.
    - This information can be used to further exploit vulnerabilities on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests with crafted parameters in the URL to `admin.php`, `modules.php`, and `user.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PostNuke instance.
- No special privileges on the server are needed; the vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.
