- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A non-privileged user can export the security policy file (XML), modify it (e.g., change the default policy location to a non-existent one), and import it back. This leads to the Sygate Security Agent (SSA) failing open (disabling the firewall) upon restart.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper access control, lack of integrity checks for policy files. The policy file can be exported and imported by a non-privileged user, and the agent does not properly validate the modified policy file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The main impact is that the security agent's firewall fails open and does not apply any security policy, thereby potentially exposing the client system to attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access by a non-privileged user. The user needs to be able to access the export/import functionality and modify the policy file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A non-privileged user with local access to a machine running a vulnerable version of SSA and the ability to manipulate files.
