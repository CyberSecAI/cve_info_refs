QuickTime for Windows has problems with malformed GIF images. Open test.gif with \
PictureViewer and it will crash. DrWatson is reporting access violation. Main reason \
for crash is malformed value of "depth start", in test.gif this value is set to 255 \
(0xff hexadecimal). I've tested about twenty different values in range 0x00-0xfe, and \
PictureViewer in all cases reports that file is corrupted. It leads to assumption \
that there is some kind of integer overflow in processing GIF files.

Also, this could be done with almost any GIF file. Simply change "depth start" byte \
to 0xff. If it doesn't crash PictureViewer try to change width and height of logical \
screen in GIF header.

I dont know if this could be used for code execution.

This is tested on freshly updated QuickTime, version 6.5.2.

And here is test.gif:
