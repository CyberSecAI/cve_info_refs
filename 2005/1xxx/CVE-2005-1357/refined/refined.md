The provided content describes vulnerabilities in a `text.cgi` script, which directly corresponds to the description of CVE-2005-1357 that involves a vulnerable `text.cgi` script.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `text.cgi` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the query string, allowing for several attack vectors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** The script allows reading arbitrary files by including their path in the query string (e.g., `text.cgi?/etc/passwd`).
2.  **Remote Command Execution:** The script allows the execution of arbitrary commands by including them in the query string, prefixed by a pipe symbol (e.g., `text.cgi?|command`).
3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (CSS):** The script is vulnerable to cross-site scripting by allowing the injection of JavaScript code via the query string (e.g., `text.cgi?<script>alert>(document.cookie)</script>`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive system files, such as `/etc/passwd`, potentially leading to the disclosure of user accounts and passwords if not properly hashed/salted.
2.  **Remote Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.
3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (CSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the context of the website, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector for all vulnerabilities is the query string of the HTTP request to the `text.cgi` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server hosting the `text.cgi` script. No special privileges are required.
