How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Developers depend on every day.

Source: [www.MerakMailServer.com](http://www.MerakMailServer.com)

VULNERABLE PRODUCT

MERAK Mail Server 8.0.3 with Icewarp Web Mail 5.4.2 (maybe other)

DETAILS

1. Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Description:
Remote user, who HAS account on Merak Mail Server, can execute cross-site scripting \
(XSS) attack.

Vulnerable scripts:
address.html
addressaction.html
settings.html
calendarsettings.html

Examples:

<http://localhost:32000/mail/address.html> -> Add New Address -> E-mail address = \
[xss_here] <http://localhost:32000/mail/address.html> -> Add New Address -> Other -> \
Note = [xss_here] <http://localhost:32000/mail/address.html> -> Add New Address -> \
Public Certificate (PEM Format) = [xss_here] \
<http://localhost:32000/mail/settings.html> -> Signature = [xss_here] \
<http://localhost:32000/mail/calendarsettings.html> -> Shared calendars = [xss_here]

2. Full install path disclosure.

Description:
Remote user, who HAS account on Merak Mail Server, can disclosure full install path \
of the product. It could be used during attack on an affected system.

Vulnerable scripts:
calendar_addevent.html
calendar_event.html
calendar_task.html

Examples:
<http://localhost:32000/mail/calendar_addevent.html?id=>[sessionid]
<http://localhost:32000/mail/calendar_event.html?id=>[sessionid]
<http://localhost:32000/mail/calendar_task.html?id=>[sessionid]

3. Moving user home directory.

Description:
Remote user, who HAS account on Merak Mail Server, can moving his home directory with \
subdirectories to his mail folder. Default home directory: [Merak Root Dir] \ Webmail \
\ Users \ [Domain] \ [User] Default user mail folder: [Merak Root Dir] \ Mail \ \
[Domain] \ [User] It could be used during attack on an affected system.

Vulnerable script:
viewaction.html

Example:
<http://localhost:32000/mail/viewaction.html?id=>[sessionid]&Move_x=1&folder=\

4. MERAK local file detection.

Description:
Remote user, who HAS account on Merak Mail Server, can detect arbitrary file existing \
on local file system of Merak Mail Server. It could be used during attack on an \
                affected system.
Note: File mailbox.dat (in user home directory) MUST NOT EXISTS during exploiting of \
this vulnerability. Possible move this file using vulnerability #3.

Vulnerable script:
attachment.html

Example:
<http://localhost:32000/mail/attachment.html?id=>[sessionid]&attachmentpage_text_title=FILE \
NOT FOUND&folder=[full path to file]

5. Moving and viewing arbitrary files on remote system.

Description:
Remote user, who HAS account on Merak Mail Server, can moving arbitrary files on \
local file system of the target. The file will be moved to user home directory \
(default [Merak Root Dir]\webmail\users\[Domain]\[User]) and will be renamed to \
import.tmp. After that attacker can view this file using vulnerability #3 or import \
file to address book and view it in there. This vulnerability could be used for \
causing denial of service (DOS) conditions or access to arbitrary files on affected \
system. From files user.dat, users.dat attacker could get users and administrators \
passwords and take complete control of a Merak Mail Server. With administrator \
privileges on Merak Mail Server the attacker using [Executables] function of the \
product could execute arbitrary commands on remote system with mailserver privileges. \
If Merak Mail Server was been running under administrator account then attacker could \
take complete control of an affected system. This vulnerability also could be used \
for   detection arbitrary file existing on Merak Mail Server.

Vulnerable script:
importaction.html

Example:
Moving target file to user home directory:
<http://localhost:32000/importaction.html?id=>[sessionid]&importfile=[arbitrary \
path]&action=upload&Import=1&importfile_size=1000000 Import target file to user \
address book: <http://localhost:32000/mail/importaction.html?id=>[sessionid]&action=set&divider=%3a&sel[[0]](#0)=NAME1
