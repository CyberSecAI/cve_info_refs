The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in PostNuke 0.760{RC2,RC3}, specifically within the RSS module.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `magpie_slashbox.php`, `magpie_simple.php`, and `magpie_debug.php` scripts within the RSS module do not properly sanitize user-supplied input (`rss_url` or `url` parameters) before including it in the HTML output.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Malicious JavaScript code injected via the `rss_url` or `url` parameters in the URLs.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker only needs to convince a victim to access the crafted URLs.

    *Examples of vulnerable URLs:*
    ```
    http://[HOST]/[DIR]/modules/RSS/pnincludes/scripts/magpie_slashbox.php?rss_url=[XSS]
    http://[HOST]/[DIR]/modules/RSS/pnincludes/scripts/magpie_simple.php?url=">[XSS]
    http://[HOST]/[DIR]/modules/RSS/pnincludes/scripts/magpie_debug.php?url=%22%3E[XSS]
    ```

2.  **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `simple_smarty.php` script attempts to include a file using a hardcoded path which is not available on the system, leading to a PHP error.
    *   **Weakness:** Information Leakage via error messages
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the `simple_smarty.php` script directly via a web browser.
    *   **Impact:** The full server path is exposed in the error message, potentially aiding attackers in further reconnaissance and attacks.
   *  *Examples of vulnerable URLs:*
    ```
    http://[HOST]/[DIR]/modules/RSS/pnincludes/scripts/simple_smarty.php
    ```
