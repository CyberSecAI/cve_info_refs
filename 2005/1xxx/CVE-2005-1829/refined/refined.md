- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from Microsoft Internet Explorer's failure to limit the depth of embedded files. This allows a crafted set of HTML files to create an infinite loop when processing nested `<object>` tags.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of depth limitation when handling embedded files leading to an infinite loop.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The infinite loop causes Internet Explorer to crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is triggered by opening a specially crafted HTML file (or set of files) in Internet Explorer. The files use `<object>` tags that refer to each other, creating a recursive loop.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide the victim with the malicious HTML files and entice them to open these files using Internet Explorer.
