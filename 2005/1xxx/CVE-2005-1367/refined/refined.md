- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Pico Server (pServ) does not properly validate symbolic links, allowing them to point outside the webroot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The server follows symlinks without checking if the target is within the webroot, leading to a local file inclusion vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read any file on the server that pServ has permissions to access. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as password files, configuration files, or other data not intended for public access.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with write access to any directory within the web server's document root (e.g., through FTP or other means) can create a symlink pointing to any file on the server. Then, they can access the content of the linked file by navigating to the symbolic link using a web browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have write access to a directory within the web server's document root and be able to access the web server through a web browser.
