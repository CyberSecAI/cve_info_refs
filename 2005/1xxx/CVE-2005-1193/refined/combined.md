I don't normally send an email about updated packages, but this one fixes
a potentially serious issue.

re: <http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=288194>

A high risk bbcode.php vulnerability is patched with this version, at the
very least please patch it via the link above.  It was discovered by
Papados and patched by myself.  In agreement with phpbb.com, we'll
(CastleCops) release the full details in five days.  A CVE has been
obtained.

Hi everyone,

phpBB Group announces the release of phpBB 2.0.15, the "summer needs to be hot" release. This release addresses some bugfixes and addressing some security issues, one being serious. With this release the admin re-authentication security feature from phpBB Olympus has been backported to the 2.0.x branch too.

To fix the serious issue, please apply the following code changes:

In includes/bbcode.php

Find:

Code: Select all

```
{
	global $lang, $bbcode_tpl;

```

After, add:

Code: Select all

```
	$text = preg_replace('#(script|about|applet|activex|chrome):#is', "\\1&#058;", $text);

```

Find:

Code: Select all

```
 */
function make_clickable($text)
{

```

After, Add:

Code: Select all

```
	$text = preg_replace('#(script|about|applet|activex|chrome):#is', "\\1&#058;", $text);

```

It is highly recommended to apply the complete update though.

Language authors please note that one language variable has been added too.

As with all new releases we urge you to update as soon as possible. You can of course find this download available on our [downloads page](http://www.phpbb.com/downloads.php). As per usual three packages are available to simplify your update.

* **Full Package**

  Contains entire phpBB2 source and English language package
* **Changed Files Only**

  Contains only those files changed from previous versions of phpBB. Please note this archive contains changed files for **each** previous release
* **Patch Files**

  Contains patch compatible patches from the previous versions of phpBB.

Select whichever package is most suitable for you.

**Please ensure you read the INSTALL and README documents in docs/ before proceeding with installation or updates!.**

**What has changed in this release?**

The changelog (contained within this release) is as follows:

* Fixed moderator status removal in groupcp.php
* Removed newlines after ?> on some files - **Thoul**
* Added admin re-authentication (admin needs to login seperatly to access the ACP) - backported from Olympus
* Fixed vulnerability in url/bbcode handling functions - **PapaDos and Paul/Zhen-Xjell from CastleCops**
* Fixed issue in admin/admin\_forums.php
* Suppressed warning message for fsockopen in /includes/smtp.php - **Thoul**
* Fixed bug in admin/admin\_smilies.php (admin is able to add empty smilies) - **Exy**
* Adjusted documents to reflect the urgent need to update the files too (not only running the database update script)
* Updated the readme file
* Added one new language variable
* Added general error if accessing profile for a non-existent user
* Changed session id generation to be more unique - **Henno Joosep**
* Fixed bug in highlight code to escape characters correctly
* Reversed the 2.0.14 fix for postgresql because it produced more problems than it solves.
* Added reference to article written by R45 about case-sensitivity in postgreSQL to the readme file
* Fixed bypassing of validate\_username on registration - **Yen**
* Empty url/img bbcodes no longer get parsed

As always, our Code Changes Tutorial is available too for those with heavily modded boards.

It can be downloaded [from this location](http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=288165).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## phpBB contains an input validation vulnerability in "includes/bbcode.php"

#### Vulnerability Note VU#113196

Original Release Date: 2005-05-12 | Last Revised: 2005-05-12

---

### Overview

phpBB fails to sanitize user input, allowing the possible inclusion of active script content in user posts.

### Description

| [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com) is a widely used Open Source bulletin board package written in PHP.  An input validation issue has been identified that allows a malicious phpBB user to include active script code in a post.The functions to process user input to generate HTML that makes up a user post on the bulletin board fails to prevent the inclusion of active script tags.  Version 2.0.15 of phpBB adds code to two functions in "includes/bbcode.php" to blacklist certain active script tags, as an attempt to address this vulnerability. While this may mitigate this vulnerability, in general blacklisting is not an effective counter measure to malicious user input, due to the fact that characters can be encoded in many ways. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Malicious users can post to phpBB bulletin boards and include active script code. For many users the active script code will be executed by their browsers, due to active content being enabled by default in many popularly browsers.  Note that proof of concept code has been made public. There are also reports of the vulnerability being exploited in order to capturesite administrator authentication details, which are then used to perform further attacks unrelated to the phpBB flaw. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The flaw has been addressed in phpBB 2.0.15. For more information on the patch please see:  <http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=288194>Code has been added to the includes/bbcode.php to blacklist certain active script tags, as an attempt to address this vulnerability. In general blacklisting is not an effective counter measure to malicious user input, due to the fact that characters can be encoded in many ways.As a best practice, users of bulletin board sites and other sites where content is created from untrusted sources, such as the public, should consider turning off all forms of scripting support in their browsers.More information about injecting code into forums is available in the [CERT/CC advisory CA-2000-02](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html). |

a potentially serious issue.

re: <http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=288194>

A high risk bbcode.php vulnerability is patched with this version, at the
very least please patch it via the link above.  It was discovered by
Papados and patched by myself.  In agreement with phpbb.com, we'll
(CastleCops) release the full details in five days.  A CVE has been
obtained.
