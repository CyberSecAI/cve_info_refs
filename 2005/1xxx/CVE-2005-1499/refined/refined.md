The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in myBloggie 2.1.1. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Full Path Disclosure:**
*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of the `post_id` parameter.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation/sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of the server's full file path.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request to `index.php` with `mode=viewid` and a malformed `post_id`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires only the ability to send HTTP requests.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of sanitization for the `year` parameter in `viewmode.php` and parameters that cause SQL errors.
*   **Weakness:** Improper output encoding, specifically not sanitizing user-controlled input before displaying it back to the user.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript in a user's browser within the context of the vulnerable site, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*  **Attack Vectors:**  Crafted URLs with malicious scripts in parameters like `year`, `cat_id`, `month_no`, and `post_id`, either directly or via MySQL error outputs.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to craft URLs and lure users to click them.

**3. Arbitrary Comment Deletion:**
*   **Root Cause:**  Missing access control in `delcomment.php`, allowing unauthorized deletion of comments.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient authorization checks. The script doesn't verify if the user has the right to delete the specified comment.
*   **Impact:** Any user can delete arbitrary comments by crafting a specific URL, leading to data loss and potential disruption.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a URL to `index.php` with `mode=delcom`, a target `comment_id`, and `confirm=yes`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires only the ability to craft URLs and know (or guess) comment IDs.

**4. SQL Injection:**
*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of sanitization of the `keyword` parameter in `search.php` and other parameters before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data used in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious SQL code in parameters such as `keyword`, `date_no`, `cat_id`, `month_no`, and `post_id`.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests with crafted query parameters and some knowledge of SQL.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**
