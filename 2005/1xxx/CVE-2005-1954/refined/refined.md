Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Path Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The application's heavy use of classes leads to multiple path disclosure vulnerabilities. When accessing certain files directly via a browser, PHP error messages reveal the full server path of the included class files.
*   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate access control and error handling. The application should not expose internal file paths in error messages.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could gain knowledge of the server's file structure, potentially aiding further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Direct browser access to sensitive files (.php files).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities are required; simply browsing to the vulnerable URL.

**Affected Files:**
    *   `gallery/includes/admin.class.php`
    *   All `.tpl.php` files within `templates/admin_default/`
    *   All `.tpl.php` files within `templates/default/`

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `gallery` parameter in `index.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be injected.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and output encoding.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that could be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Crafting a URL with malicious Javascript in the `gallery` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to entice users to click on a crafted URL.

**Example Attack URL:**
    *   `www.site.com/index.php?gallery=%3Cimg%20onmouseover=%22alert('hi')%22%20style=%22position:%20absolute;%20top:0px;%20left:%200px;%20width:%201000%;%20height:%201000%;%22%3E`
