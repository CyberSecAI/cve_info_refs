Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1**
*   **Root Cause:** The application exposes order notification files through predictable file names using `testmy.cgi` and `testmy.pl`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insecure direct object reference, information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can obtain sensitive data related to orders, such as customer information and potentially credit card details.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is accessible through HTTP GET requests to the application's web server.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  No special capabilities are needed; an attacker simply needs network access to the vulnerable application.

**Vulnerability 2**
*   **Root Cause:** The application stores the admin password in plaintext or weakly encrypted (DES) in a file accessible via web requests.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insecure storage of credentials, information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can obtain the administrator password, granting full access to the application and its data.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is accessible through HTTP GET requests to the application's web server.
*    **Required Capabilities:**  No special capabilities are needed; an attacker simply needs network access to the vulnerable application.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

* The application stores the admin password in a weakly encrypted format in a file accessible by the web.
* The application exposes order notification files through predictable filenames, and they can be accessed without authentication.
* The document suggests using `.htaccess` for mitigation, implying that the server is running Apache.
