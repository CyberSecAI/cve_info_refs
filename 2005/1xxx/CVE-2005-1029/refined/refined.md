Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-1029 (based on the provided content, although no CVE description was included)

**Vulnerability Description:**

The provided information details multiple SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Active Auction House software from Active Web Softwares.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The primary cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation before user-supplied data is used in SQL queries or displayed on the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities were identified, affecting several parameters. These include `catid`, `Sortby`, `itemID`, and the `Email` field in `sendpassword.asp`. By injecting malicious SQL code into these parameters, an attacker can manipulate database queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities are present due to the lack of proper output encoding. Parameters such as `ReturnURL`, `Title`, and `itemid` in various ASP files allow injection of JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information.
    *   The attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database.
*  **XSS:**
    *  An attacker could steal user cookies.
    *  An attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of the user, such as session hijacking or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the query string parameters like `catid`, `Sortby`, `itemID`, or the `Email` field.
*   **XSS:** By crafting URLs with malicious JavaScript code in parameters like `ReturnURL`, `Title` or `itemid`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs that contain SQL injection and XSS payloads. No special privileges or insider access is required to execute these attacks.

**Additional Technical Details:**
The advisory includes specific examples of vulnerable URLs and the resulting SQL errors when attempting injection. This information provides concrete evidence of the vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability was discovered by Dcrab of the Hsc Security Group and dP Security.

The advisory suggests that using functions like `htmlspeacialchars()`, `mysql_escape_string()`, and `mysql_real_escape_string()` for input validation would mitigate the vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability was discovered in the Active Auction House software.
