Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1776:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `READ_TCP_STRING()` function within the `game_message_functions.cpp` file of the C'Nedra application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `READ_TCP_STRING()` function reads a 32-bit number specifying the size of an incoming text string from the network.
- It then copies the received string into a local buffer that is only 100 bytes long.
- The code does not properly validate the size of the incoming string, leading to a buffer overflow if a string larger than 100 bytes is received.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a buffer overflow by sending a text string larger than 100 bytes, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network message to the C'Nedra server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the C'Nedra server.
- No authentication is mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability is likely exploitable without prior authentication.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content mentions a proof-of-concept (POC) exploit available at `http://aluigi.org/poc/cnedrabof.zip`.
- The vulnerability affects C'Nedra versions <= 0.4.0.
- No fix for this vulnerability is mentioned in the content, and developers did not respond to the report.
