The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in MaxWebPortal 1.3.5 and prior, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   The `fpassword` parameter in the `ChkUser` function within `inc_functions.asp` is vulnerable to SQL injection because it is not checked or sanitized.
    *   The `txtAddress`, `message`, and `subject` parameters in `post_info.asp` are not sanitized, allowing SQL injection.
    *   The `andor` parameter on line 140 of `search.asp` allows SQL injection via a crafted POST request.
    *   The `verkey` parameter on line 132 of `pop_profile.asp` is not sanitized, enabling SQL injection via a crafted query string.
    *   SQL injection is possible through cookie manipulation in `pop_profile.asp` and other functions that use cookie authentication. Specifically, by modifying the password cookie to `''`, SQL injection can occur in the `ChkUsr2` function.
    *   The `Remove` parameter on line 85 of `pm_delete2.asp` is vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of sanitization.
     *  The `Delete` parameter in `pm_delete2.asp` is vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of sanitization.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Multiple parameters in `/post.asp` ( `Forum_Title`, `mod`, `M`, and `type`) are vulnerable to XSS through the injection of `<plaintext>` tags.
    *   Posting a forum topic with a `Forum_Title` such as `http://<plaintext>` results in permanent XSS.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the MaxWebPortal application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries or displaying it on web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms.
    *   Attackers can steal sensitive data, including user passwords.
    *   Attackers can modify data within the database.
    *   Attackers can potentially gain full control over the web application and its underlying infrastructure.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Attackers can inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   Attackers can potentially steal user session cookies and hijack accounts.
    *   Attackers can deface the portal.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Manipulating URL parameters (`fpassword`, `andor`, `verkey`).
    *   Manipulating POST parameters (`txtAddress`, `message`, `subject`).
    *   Manipulating cookies.
   *   Manipulating URL parameters (`Remove`, `Delete`)
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Manipulating URL parameters (`Forum_Title`, `mod`, `M`, `type`).
    *   Inserting malicious content via forum posts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests with crafted parameters to the vulnerable web application.
*   For cookie-based SQL injection, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate their browser cookies.
*   A basic understanding of SQL and XSS is required.

The vendor was contacted and released version 1.3.6 which is expected to resolve these issues.
