Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in Blue Coat Reporter 7.1.1.1 as described in the marc.info email:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **a) Privilege Escalation:** The application fails to properly validate user privileges when creating new accounts, allowing a non-administrative user to create an administrator account.
*   **b) HTML-Code Injection:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when adding a license, allowing unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary HTML code into the licensing view.
*   **c) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) at Login:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the username field on the login page, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **a) Privilege Escalation:** Insufficient authorization checks when creating user accounts.
*   **b) HTML-Code Injection:** Lack of input sanitization when processing license information.
*   **c) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper handling of user-supplied input on the login page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **a) Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain full administrative access to the Blue Coat Reporter application, potentially compromising the entire system and the data it manages.
*   **b) HTML-Code Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code, such as JavaScript, which is executed in the browser of other users viewing the affected pages. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **c) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user viewing the login page. This could be used for session hijacking or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **a) Privilege Escalation:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the user creation endpoint.
*  **b) HTML-Code Injection:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with malicious HTML in the license field.
*   **c) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Providing malicious JavaScript code in the username field on the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **a) Privilege Escalation:**
    *   Must have network access to the Blue Coat Reporter application.
    *   Must have a non-administrative user account.
*   **b) HTML-Code Injection:**
    *   Must have network access to the Blue Coat Reporter application.
*   **c) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Must have network access to the Blue Coat Reporter application.
