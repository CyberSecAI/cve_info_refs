- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Zoidcom library uses the first 4 bytes of a UDP packet to determine the size of the packet data in bits, without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The library allocates a buffer based on the size specified in the first 4 bytes of the UDP packet. It doesn't validate the size, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can specify a large number of bits in the first 4 bytes of a UDP packet, causing the `Deserialize()` function to attempt to read unallocated memory, or crash the program due to a failed memory allocation.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted UDP packet to either the Zoidcom server or client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to a vulnerable Zoidcom application.
