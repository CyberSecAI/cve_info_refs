- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The built-in web server in SimpleCam 1.2 does not properly handle directory traversal patterns like "..\" in HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the webserver's document root and access or download arbitrary files on the remote system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\windows\system.ini`) to the vulnerable webserver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running SimpleCam 1.2.
