        "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Visiting a malicious website hosting a specially crafted JPEG image.",
          "Viewing a malicious HTML email containing a specially crafted JPEG image."
