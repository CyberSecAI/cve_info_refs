Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2005-1834:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in multiple weaknesses in the NEXTWEB (i)Site website management system. These include:
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Improper handling of user inputs in `login.asp` allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.
    *   **Insecure Directory:** Database files are stored in a publicly accessible web directory, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation/Exception Handling:** The application fails to validate user inputs and handle exceptions properly, leading to application errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `login.asp` page is vulnerable to SQL injection, which can be exploited to bypass authentication.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Databases are stored in a publicly accessible directory (`/databases/`) allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. Specifically the `Users.mdb` file.
*   **Denial of Service:** Lack of proper error handling and input validation enables attackers to cause application errors, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Successful SQL injection can lead to complete administrative access to the (i)Site system.
*   **Credential Disclosure:** Downloading the `Users.mdb` file discloses administrative usernames and passwords.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Crafted requests can cause the web application to error, leading to temporary denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** SQL injection is achieved through crafted HTTP POST requests to the login form, manipulating the username and password fields.
*   **Direct URL Access:**  Sensitive database files are directly accessible via HTTP GET requests to known public directories.
*   **Malicious Input:** HTTP GET requests to vulnerable `.asp` pages with malformed input cause application errors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:**  Understanding of HTTP requests and basic SQL syntax are required to perform the SQL injection.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication, as it bypasses the login process. The information disclosure vulnerability is available without authentication as well.
