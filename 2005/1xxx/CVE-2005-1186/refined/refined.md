{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Musicmatch added *.musicmatch.com to the Trusted Sites zone in Internet Explorer. This zone operates with a very high level of privilege, and by default has the lowest security settings in XP SP2 and later. This, coupled with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the musicmatch domain, allowed for elevation of privilege.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Adding a wildcard domain (*.musicmatch.com) to the Internet Explorer Trusted Sites zone without appropriate security considerations.",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities present in the musicmatch domain."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could leverage XSS vulnerabilities in the trusted musicmatch.com domain to execute malicious scripts within the context of the trusted zone, potentially leading to elevation of privileges or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks targeting the *.musicmatch.com domain.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities on the musicmatch.com domain to inject malicious scripts. The user must have Musicmatch installed and the *.musicmatch.com domain present in their IE trusted sites."
