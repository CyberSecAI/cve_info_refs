Hyperdose Security Advisory

Name: Trusted Site Cross Site Scripting Elevation of Privilege in Musicmatch
Systems Affected: Musicmatch v10.00.2047 or earlier (according to Yahoo
v9.00.5059 and earlier are also affected)
Severity: Moderate
Author: Robert Fly - robfly () hyperdose com
Advisory URL: <http://www.hyperdose.com/advisories/H2005-04.txt>

--MusicMatch Description--

```

```
and organize your music, giving you ultimate control of your music
experience."  In September 04 Musicmatch was purchased by Yahoo! Inc.

--Bug Details--
Upon installation of MusicMatch versions prior to 10.00.2047, the domain
*.musicmatch.com is added to the Trusted Sites zone of IE.  This zone runs
at a very high level of privilege and since XP SP2, this zone offers the
lowest security in a default install.  As such, adding a domain to this zone
needs extra security consideration.

The most common way of taking advantage of an application setting this is
through Cross Site Scripting issues.  A quick check showed that there were
exploitable XSS bugs in the musicmatch domain.

Musicmatch in its latest release has now removed *.musicmatch.com from the
Trusted Sites zone (Yahoo!) which is a smart move.  They have also fixed the
XSS vulnerabilities which I had previously reported to them as well.

--Fix Information--
As of 3/21/05 Yahoo has released a new version which fixes this
vulnerability.  I have witheld vulnerability details until now so that
MusicMatch automatic updates had a chance to propogate.
