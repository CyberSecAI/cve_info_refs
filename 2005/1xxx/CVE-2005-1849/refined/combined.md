Debian Security Advisory DSA 1026-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Moritz Muehlenhoff
April 6th, 2006                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : sash
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem-Type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-1849 CVE-2005-2096
Debian Bug     : 318069

Markus Oberhumer discovered a flaw in the way zlib, a library used for
file compression and decompression, handles invalid input. This flaw can
cause programs which use zlib to crash when opening an invalid file.
A further error in the way zlib handles the inflation of certain
compressed files can cause a program which uses zlib to crash when opening
an invalid file.

sash, the stand-alone shell, links statically against zlib, and was
thus affected by these problems.

The old stable distribution (woody) isn't affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7-5sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your sash package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 797-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                              Michael Stone
September 1st, 2005                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : zsync
Vulnerability  : DOS
Problem-Type   : buffer overflow
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-1849, CAN-2005-2096

zsync, a file transfer program, includes a modified local copy of
the zlib library, and is vulnerable to certain bugs fixed previously
in the zlib package.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the zsync
package.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.3-1.sarge.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.0-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your zsync package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# zlib: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200507-19**

zlib is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially lead to
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/zlib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.3** |

### Background

zlib is a widely used free and patent unencumbered data
compression library.

### Description

zlib improperly handles invalid data streams which could lead to a
buffer overflow.

### Impact

By creating a specially crafted compressed data stream, attackers
can overwrite data structures for applications that use zlib, resulting
in arbitrary code execution or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All zlib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/zlib-1.2.3"
```

It is reported to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow issue in the "inflate_table()" function in the "inftrees.c" file. Zlib versions 1.2.2 and earlier are reported to be vulnerable. Ref: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/14162>   (6) HIGH: zlib Compression Library Buffer Overflow Affected: zlib version 1.2.1 and 1.2.2  Description: zlib is a popular compression library that is widely used by programs across all OSs including Linux, Mac OS and Windows. This library contains a buffer overflow that can be triggered by a specially crafted compressed file. An attacker, who can deliver such a crafted file to a program using zlib, may exploit the overflow to execute arbitrary code. For example, a webserver can set "Content-Encoding" HTTP header to gzip, which may lead to an overflow in the browser using the zlib library. The technical details required to craft a malicious file may be obtained by examining the patch.  Status: The vendor will release an official update soon. Many Linux vendors have already provided updates. A list of applications that use zlib can be found at: <http://www.gzip.org/zlib/apps.gz.html>. Many of these applications may require an update from the corresponding vendor.  Council Site Actions: Only a few of the council sites are responding to this item.   One site said their Linux systems will obtain updated packages from the Linux vendor, as the packages become available. Another site will patch their externally accessible servers immediately, and then roll out to internal servers as part of their standard patch cycle. The other sites are still evaluating their risk/exposure level and formulating a remediation response.

I've dug and dug and cannot find any example files to use TO test that the DoS conditions in zlib have been fixed.  It bothers me that we cannot test this.  The Fedora Core 3 fix for this apparently is in [Bug #163038](show_bug.cgi?id=163038 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CAN-2005-1849 zlib buffer overflow").

Debian Security Advisory DSA 763-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Michael Stone
July 20, 2005                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : zlib
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote DoS
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-1849

Markus Oberhumer discovered a flaw in the way zlib, a library used for
file compression and decompression, handles invalid input. This flaw can
cause programs which use zlib to crash when opening an invalid file.

This problem does not affect the old stable distribution (woody).

For the current stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.2.2-4.sarge.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zlib package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 3.1 (stable)
- -------------------

  Stable was released for alpha, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

# Pngcrush: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200603-18**

Pngcrush is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/pngcrush** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.2** |

### Background

Pngcrush is an optimizer for PNG files.

### Description

Carsten Lohrke of Gentoo Linux reported that Pngcrush contains a
vulnerable version of zlib (GLSA 200507-19).

### Impact

By creating a specially crafted data stream, attackers can
overwrite data structures for applications that use Pngcrush, resulting
in a Denial of Service and potentially arbitrary code execution.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Pngcrush users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/pngcrush-1.6.2"
```

# Qt: Buffer overflow in the included zlib library — GLSA **200509-18**

Qt is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-libs/qt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.3.4-r8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.3.4-r8** |

### Background

Qt is a cross-platform GUI toolkit used by KDE.

### Description

Qt links to a bundled vulnerable version of zlib when emerged with the
zlib USE-flag disabled. This may lead to a buffer overflow.

### Impact

By creating a specially crafted compressed data stream, attackers can
overwrite data structures for applications that use Qt, resulting in a
Denial of Service or potentially arbitrary code execution.

### Workaround

Emerge Qt with the zlib USE-flag enabled.

### Resolution

All Qt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/qt-3.3.4-r8"
```

# USN-151-3: zlib vulnerabilities

29 October 2005

zlib vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

USN-148-1 and USN-151-1 fixed two security flaws in zlib, which could

be exploited to cause Denial of Service attacks or even arbitrary code

execution with malicious data streams.

Since aide is statically linked against the zlib library, it is also

affected by these issues. The updated packagages have been rebuilt

against the fixed zlib.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.
