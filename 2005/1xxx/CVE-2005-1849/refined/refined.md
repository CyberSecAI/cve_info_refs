 CVE ID         : CVE-2005-1849 CVE-2005-2096
 
 Markus Oberhumer discovered a flaw in the way zlib, a library used for
 file compression and decompression, handles invalid input. This flaw can
 cause programs which use zlib to crash when opening an invalid file.
 A further error in the way zlib handles the inflation of certain
 compressed files can cause a program which uses zlib to crash when opening
 an invalid file.
 
 sash, the stand-alone shell, links statically against zlib, and was
 thus affected by these problems.
 ```
 *   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in the way the zlib library handles invalid input during file compression and decompression.
 *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in zlib.
 *  **Impact of exploitation**:  Programs using the vulnerable zlib can crash when opening an invalid file.  This could also lead to arbitrary code execution.
 *   **Attack vectors**: Opening a specially crafted, invalid compressed file.
 *   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to provide a crafted, invalid compressed file to a vulnerable application. This could be local or remote.

 zlib is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially lead to
 execution of arbitrary code.
 
 ### Description
 zlib improperly handles invalid data streams which could lead to a
 buffer overflow.
 
 ### Impact
 By creating a specially crafted compressed data stream, attackers
 can overwrite data structures for applications that use zlib, resulting
 in arbitrary code execution or a Denial of Service.
 ```
 *   **Root cause of vulnerability**: zlib improperly handles invalid data streams.

 Pngcrush is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially lead to
 the execution of arbitrary code.
 
 ### Description
 Carsten Lohrke of Gentoo Linux reported that Pngcrush contains a
 vulnerable version of zlib (GLSA 200507-19).
 
 ### Impact
 By creating a specially crafted data stream, attackers can
 overwrite data structures for applications that use Pngcrush, resulting
 in a Denial of Service and potentially arbitrary code execution.
 ```
 *   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Pngcrush contains a vulnerable version of zlib.
 *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in the included zlib library.
 *   **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service and potentially arbitrary code execution.
 *   **Attack vectors**: Using a specially crafted data stream.
 *   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to provide a crafted data stream that Pngcrush would process.

 Qt is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially lead to the
 execution of arbitrary code.
 
 ### Description
 Qt links to a bundled vulnerable version of zlib when emerged with the
 zlib USE-flag disabled. This may lead to a buffer overflow.
 
 ### Impact
 By creating a specially crafted compressed data stream, attackers can
 overwrite data structures for applications that use Qt, resulting in a
 Denial of Service or potentially arbitrary code execution.
 ```
 *   **Root cause of vulnerability**:  Qt links to a vulnerable zlib library when compiled without system zlib support.
 *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in the bundled zlib library in Qt.
 *   **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service or arbitrary code execution.
 *   **Attack vectors**: Using a specially crafted compressed data stream.
 *  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to provide a crafted compressed data stream to a Qt application. This could be local or remote.

 USN-151-3: zlib vulnerabilities
 ...
 USN-148-1 and USN-151-1 fixed two security flaws in zlib, which could
 be exploited to cause Denial of Service attacks or even arbitrary code
 execution with malicious data streams.
 
 Since aide is statically linked against the zlib library, it is also
 affected by these issues. The updated packagages have been rebuilt
 against the fixed zlib.

 CAN-2005-2096 zlib buffer overflow
 This affects zlib 1.2 and up, which is FC1 and FC2.
 ```
 ```
 Looks like we forgot [CAN-2005-1849](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-1849). Since the patch to fix it was trivial, I rebuilt packages with it included and put them directly into testing.
 ```
 *   **Root cause of vulnerability**:  Improper handling of data streams in zlib.
 *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in zlib.
 *  **Impact of exploitation**: Not explicitly mentioned, but the context indicates it can lead to issues related to the buffer overflow.
 *  **Attack vectors**:  Using malformed data streams.
 *   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to provide a crafted compressed data stream to a zlib application. This could be local or remote.

 ## Summary of Findings
 CVE-2005-1849 is related to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the zlib library. Multiple sources confirm that this vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) and potentially arbitrary code execution, by providing crafted, invalid or malicious compressed data streams. Several applications are identified to be vulnerable due to use of vulnerable zlib, either directly or by static linking of the vulnerable library. Attack vectors typically involve the processing of specially crafted compressed data.
 ```
