The provided content describes vulnerabilities in PHPNuke versions 6.x - 7.6, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Full Path Disclosure.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in several parameters, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Improper input sanitization, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of a user's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect them to malicious sites.
*   **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious URLs or form inputs.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a user a malicious URL or trick the user into submitting a malicious form, requiring some level of social engineering or control over a site that links to the vulnerable application.

**Full Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root cause:** The application fails to properly handle errors or exceptions, revealing the full server path of the PHP files in error messages.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Verbose error messages expose sensitive path information.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file structure, which can be used to find more vulnerabilities or help plan an attack
*   **Attack vectors:** By directly accessing specific PHP scripts with invalid parameters.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to have access to the publicly accessible website.
