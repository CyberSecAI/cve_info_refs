### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves two newly-discovered, publicly and privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3 and Service Pack 4 | Internet Explorer 5.5 Service Pack 2 on Windows ME | Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (All supported operating system versions earlier than Windows Server 2003) | Internet Explorer 6 for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 | Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP Service Pack 2 |

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 883939](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/883939) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 883939](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/883939).

Known issues since original release of the bulletin:

* [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 902395](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/902395): You receive a HTTP 405 response when you click a hyperlink in Internet Explorer 6 that is in a frame and links to a WebDAV folder

**I have received a hotfix from Microsoft or my support provider since the release of MS04-004. Is that hotfix included in this security update?**

Yes. When you install the security update that is intended for systems running Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, or on Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. However, the installer only detects hotfixes that were released since Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851) and Internet Explorer [Update Rollup 873377](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/873377) or Internet Explorer [Update Rollup 889669](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/889669).
See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 883939](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/890923) for additional information if you have to apply a hotfix that was released before Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851) on a system that has the [MS05-025](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=45181) update installed.

For Internet Explorer 6 for Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003, and Windows 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium), this security update contains hotfixes that were included with or after [MS04-025](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31981), as well as fixes for all the security issues that are addressed in this update. However, the hotfix versions of the files that were included in this security update are only installed if you have previously installed an Internet Explorer hotfix to update any of the files that are listed in the âSecurity Update Informationâ section of this bulletin.

For Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2, and Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP, the [MS05-025](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=45181) security updates contain hotfixes that were included after [MS04-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189) up to and including the cumulative updates in [MS05-025](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=45181). The hotfix versions of the files that are included in this security update are installed regardless of whether you have previously installed an Internet Explorer hotfix to update any of the files that are listed in the âSecurity Update Informationâ section of this bulletin.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin and in addition to changes introduced in previous Internet Explorer Bulletins, this update includes improvements to the Internet Explorer Pop-up Blocker. The Pop-up Blocker was first included in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and is also included in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. For more information about the Pop-up Blocker, see to the [product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/web/sp2_popupblocker.mspx).

The rendering of various image file formats, including GIF and BMP, has been made more robust to help prevent Internet Explorer from closing unexpectedly when it receives an invalidly-formed image.

A change was made to Internet Explorer for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 so that it does not render the XBM image file format. This update adds this change to all other supported versions of Internet Explorer. This change has been made to help prevent the Internet Explorer process from closing unexpectedly when users view invalidly-formed images. The XBM format is no longer supported by Internet Explorer.

Additionally, this update sets the [kill bit](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797) for older versions of the Microsoft DigWebX ActiveX control that is used in MSN. This control implements support for features that are available on the [MSN Tech & Gadgets](https://tech.msn.com/) Web site. This includes the View & Organize feature and the Edit & Create feature. This control was also used by MSN Photomail to download photos from MSN. Older versions of this control have been found to contain a security vulnerability. To help protect customers who have this control installed, this update prevents older versions of this control from running in Internet Explorer. It does this by setting the kill bit for the older versions of this control that are no longer supported. For more information about kill bits, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). The older class identifiers (CLSIDs) for this ActiveX control are:

* {13FA0C3E-6B1C-4D8B-88CD-6DA8E1CA7653}

**Does this update contain any other changes to functionality?**

Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin, also included are non-security-related changes that were introduced in previous Internet Explorer Bulletins.

This update sets the [kill bit](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797) for the Microsoft MsnPUpld ActiveX control. Internet Explorer no longer supports this control and this update prevents this control from running in Internet Explorer. For more information about kill bits, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). The CLSIDs for this ActiveX control are:

* {C3DFA998-A486-11d4-AA25-00C04F72DAEB}
* {F107317A-A488-11d4-AA25-00C04F72DAEB}

## Vulnerability Details

#### PNG Image Rendering Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1211

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles PNG images. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious PNG image that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for PNG Image Rendering Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1211:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also try to compromise a Web site and have it display malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for PNG Image Rendering Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1211:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* **Disable PNG image rendering in Internet Explorer**

  To unregister Pngfilt.dll, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regsvr32 /u pngfilt.dll**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. A dialog box appears to confirm that the unregistration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
  3. Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  To re-register Pngfilt.dll, use "**regsvr32 pngfilt.dll**" (without the quotation marks).
* **Block PNG image rendering in Internet Explorer by using a Software Restriction Policy**

  To block PNG image rendering in Internet Explorer you can create a [Software Restriction Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/rstrplcy.mspx). To create this policy, use a registry script or create a Group Policy setting to block the loading of the Pngfilt.dll.

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  Use the following .reg file to un-register the PNG image rendering library in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension.

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Safer\CodeIdentifiers]

  "TransparentEnabled"=dword:00000002
  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Safer\CodeIdentifiers\0\Paths\{09687f8a-0ca9-4639-b294-a3f5b2be8fc6}]

**Impact of Workaround:** PNG images are not rendered in Internet Explorer.

#### FAQ for PNG Image Rendering Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1211:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the PNG image rendering library in Internet Explorer.

**What is PNG?**

PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics. The Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format was designed to replace the older and simpler GIF format and, to some extent, the much more complex TIFF format. For more information about PNG, visit the following [Web site](https://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngintro.html).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then persuading the user to visit the page or to view the HTML e-mail message. If the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could access information from other Web sites, could access local files in predetermined locations on the system, or could cause malicious code to run in the security context of the locally logged on user.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### XML Redirect Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CAN-2002-0648

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles certain requests to display XML content. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially lead to information disclosure if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read XML data from another Internet Explorer domain. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for XML Redirect Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CAN-2002-0648:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also try to compromise a Web site and have it display malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to XML on a system other than that of the attackerâs Web site.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/evaluation/security.asp) has been applied. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been applied. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message or click a link in an e-mail message.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

* Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=19873) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
* Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version in its default configuration.
* Use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.

#### Workarounds for XML Redirect Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CAN-2002-0648:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running Active Scripting in these zones.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting. See the âRestrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sitesâ workaround for information about how you can add sites to the Trusted sites zone.

  Alternatively, you can change your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting only. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. Prompting before running Active Scripting controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.
* **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.
* **Install the update that is described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 if you are using Outlook Express 5.5 SP2.**

  Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed.

  Customers who use one or more of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for XML Redirect Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CAN-2002-0648:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to XML on a system other than that of the attackerâs Web site.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer does not properly check to make sure that the XML data source is not redirected.

**What is XML?**

Extensible Markup Language, or XML, is a data format that provides a way for disparate applications to share data. Data for a wide variety of purposes can be stored as XML data and used by other programs. Internet Explorer provides features that allow it to display and use XML data. For more information about XML, visit the following [Web site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to XML on a system other than that of the attackerâs Web site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then persuading the user to visit the page or to view the HTML e-mail message. If the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could access local files on the system or could access information from other Web sites on the userâs behalf. The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a malicious link that is sent in an e-mail message.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability.

**What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the **Security** tab and on the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* The security level for the Internet zone is set to **High**. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by blocking Internet Explorer from receiving redirected data from a domain that is different from the page that hosts a particular XML reference.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**How does this vulnerability relate to the âXML File Reading via Redirectâ vulnerability that is corrected by MS02-047?**

This update addresses a newly reported variation of the originally reported vulnerability. This newly-reported variation was not addressed as part of MS02-047. MS02-047 helps protect against the vulnerability that is discussed in that bulletin, but does not address this new variation.

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows Server 2003, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

For Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP2\KB883939\Filelist

For Windows XP Professional x64:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB883939\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 883939 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP Service Pack 2

**Prerequisites**

This update requires Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP Service Pack 2. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 322389.](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389)

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**

The update for this issue will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2:

**Windowsxp-kb883939-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB883939.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows XP Service Pack 2:

**Windowsxp-kb883939-x86-enu /norestart**

For information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125).

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows XP Service Pack 2, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the SP2QFE files to your system.
If you have not previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the SP2GDR files to your system.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB883939\Filelist

**Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 883939 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 for Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows 2000 (all versions)

**Note** For Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium), this security update is the same as the Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems security update.

**Prerequisites**

To install the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (SP1) version of this update, you must be running Internet Explorer 6 SP1 (version 6.00.2800.1106) on one of the following versions of Windows:

* Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 or Windows 2000 Service Pack 4
* Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 Service Pack 1a (SP1a) or Small Business Server 2000 running with Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 (SP4).
* Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1
* Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium)

The software that is listed has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

For more information about how to obtain the latest service pack, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 260910](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/260910).

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**

The update for this issue will be included in a future Update Rollup or Service Pack for Windows XP.

**Note** Windows XP Service Pack 2 is also affected and has a separate security update available with this security bulletin.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951). For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows XP Service Pack 1:

**IE6.0sp1-KB883939-Windows-2000-XP-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB883939.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 and Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:

**IE6.0sp1-KB883939-Windows-2000-XP-x86-enu /norestart**

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows XP Service Pack 1 the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system.

If you have not previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

**Note** For more information, see the âI have received a hotfix from Microsoft or my support provider since the release of MS04-004. Is that hotfix included in this security update?â question in the FAQ section of this bulletin. Also, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 883939](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/890923) for more information if you have to apply a hotfix that was released before Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-038](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851) on a system that has the [MS05-020](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=43944) update installed.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Internet Explorer 6\SP1\KB883939-IE6SP1-20050428.125228\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 883939 security update into the Windows installation source files.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer buffer overflow in PNG image rendering component

#### Vulnerability Note VU#189754

Original Release Date: 2005-06-14 | Last Revised: 2005-06-27

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow in the PNG image rendering component of Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) may allow a remote attacker to execute code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image format is used as an alternative to other image formats such as the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). Microsoft Internet Explorer supports PNG image format. The PNG image rendering component of Microsoft Internet Explorer (pngfilt.dll) does not properly handle PNG image files, potentially allowing a buffer overflow to occur. If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted PNG image with IE, that attacker may be able to trigger the buffer overflow.  For more information about affected components, please refer to [MS05-025](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-025.mspx). Please note that Microsoft has reported this issue is distinct from those previously reported in [VU#817368](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/817368) and [VU#388984](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/388984) (CAN-2004-0597). |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a user opens a specially-crafted PNG image using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer, an attacker may be able execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user or cause Internet Explorer to terminate. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply An Update**Microsoft has addressed this issue in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-025](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-025.mspx). |
| --- |

| Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-025](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-025.mspx) suggests the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. **Disable PNG rendering**Until the patch can be applied, you may wish to disable the PNG rendering in IE. To disable the PNG rendering , follow these steps:   1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regsvr32 /u pngfilt.dll**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**. 2. A dialog box appears to confirm that the unregistration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. 3. Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect..  In addition, the following techniques may reduce the likelihood of exploitation:**Read and send email in plain text format**Outlook 2003, Outlook 2002 SP1, and Outlook 6 SP1 can be configured to view email messages in text format. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible. Note that reading and sending email in plain text will not necessarily prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.**Do not follow unsolicited links**In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |
