{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An unchecked buffer in the process used by Step-by-Step Interactive Training to validate bookmark link files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote code execution vulnerability due to the way Step-by-Step Interactive Training handles bookmark link files."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Constructing a malicious bookmark link file and persuading a user to open it.",
    "Sending a malicious file as an email attachment and convincing the user to open it.",
    "Hosting a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer.",
    "Compromising a website to deliver malicious content."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious bookmark file ('.cbo', '.cbl', or '.cbm') and persuade the user to interact with it by either opening the file directly, opening an email attachment, or visiting a malicious webpage. The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the target system, but the impact is greater if the user has administrative rights."
