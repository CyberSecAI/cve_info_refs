How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

davfs2 is a user-space tool to mount DAV resources into the Unix
directory tree, using the Coda kernel filesystem as a backplane.
Unfortunately, Andrew Pimlott discovered that such a mounted
filesystem does not honour the Unix permissions that stat()
presents. Details are here:

  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=310757>

If anyone knows how to fix this, please get in touch with me. Given
the impending Debian release, this is an urgent matter as davfs2
will have to be removed from Debian stable if no fix could be found
by Friday.

Cheers,

Subject: davfs2: doesn't enforce permissions
Date: Wed, 25 May 2005 11:51:10 -0700
```
Package: davfs2
Version: 0.2.3-2
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

It appears that davfs2 does not enforce unix permissions.  I just
mounted a DAV share as root.  When I list permissions in the root of the
mount, I see

    % ls -ld .
    drwxr-xr-x  1 root root 512 2005-05-25 11:43 .
    % ls -l
    total 950
    -rwxr-xr-x  0 root root      6 2005-05-25 11:43 file
    drwxr-xr-x  1 root root    512 2005-05-10 05:18 dir

However, as a regular user, I can create and modify files with no
restrictions.  For example "touch foo" and "echo hello > file" both work
fine.  I also tried mounting with mode=0700, and nothing changed, not
even the permissions displayed.  So it appears that there is no way to
restrict access to the mounted DAV share.

Also, on a possibly related note, I see that if I create a file with
"touch foo", foo has the permissions

    -rw-rw-r--  0 root root      0 2005-05-25 11:48 foo

However, if I unmount and remount, then the permissions revent to

    -rwxr-xr-x  0 root root      0 2005-05-25 11:48 foo

thanks

This just came in to the Debian bug tracking system. If you ask me,
the bug is justified. davfs2 should provide a filesystem which
enforces Unix permissions. Thus, a file should only be accessible if
the DAV server thinks so *and* the local permissions are set
accordingly.

As we are very close to a Debian stable release, I think we will
have to remove davfs2 from Debian unless we manage to fix this
before the weekend. What do you guys think?

Date: Wed, 25 May 2005 11:51:10 -0700
From: Andrew Pimlott <andrew@pimlott.net>
Subject: davfs2: doesn't enforce permissions

Package: davfs2
Version: 0.2.3-2
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

It appears that davfs2 does not enforce unix permissions.  I just
mounted a DAV share as root.  When I list permissions in the root of the
mount, I see

    % ls -ld .
    drwxr-xr-x  1 root root 512 2005-05-25 11:43 .
    % ls -l
    total 950
    -rwxr-xr-x  0 root root      6 2005-05-25 11:43 file
    drwxr-xr-x  1 root root    512 2005-05-10 05:18 dir

However, as a regular user, I can create and modify files with no
restrictions.  For example "touch foo" and "echo hello > file" both work
fine.  I also tried mounting with mode=0700, and nothing changed, not
even the permissions displayed.  So it appears that there is no way to
restrict access to the mounted DAV share.

Also, on a possibly related note, I see that if I create a file with
"touch foo", foo has the permissions

    -rw-rw-r--  0 root root      0 2005-05-25 11:48 foo

However, if I unmount and remount, then the permissions revent to

    -rwxr-xr-x  0 root root      0 2005-05-25 11:48 foo

This in from Roger Leigh:

22:07 < rleigh> madduck: Re davfs2: Check src/webdav.c, line 480.  Looks like
          executable perms are enforced, but I may be wrong (I don't know the
          interrelationship of libneon and CODA and dafvs).  auth(), line 145
          also looks suspect.  Generally, the code has a FIXMEs, and it looks
          like it is responsible for handling VFS operations.  If this is
          correct, it's not doing a very good job.
22:11 < rleigh> (chmod is blank!)
22:18 < rleigh> madduck: I'll review it some more (I've just found the mount
          option handling), but IMHO it's broken.
23:15 < rleigh> madduck: Just for the record: the only trace of uid/gid/mode
          handling is in src/util.c, dav_(set|get)_fstat_default().  This is
          used by src/davfsd.c in set_mkdir_attr and coda_open (via
          src/webdav.c in dav_stat()).  The upshot is the uid/gid are set to
          those provided.  The mode handling looks like it might be suspect,
          and I don't see any permissions checking [perhaps it's supposed to be
          in kernelspace].  I also saw at least one leak.

Hi,
Disclaimer: I don't know davfs2 and I don't use. But I disgree that every
file system should implement POSIX access semantics. There are production
class systems that don't, e.g. the Andrew file system. And as Coda, which
according to the package description is used as the backend, is a
descandant of AFS this may very well be in order.

Cheers,
        Moritz

Thanks for this valuable information.

One way to secure a davfs2 mount is to enclose the mount point in
a directory that can only be accessed by the authorised people.
However, this still gives everyone write access, even if some should
only have read access.

DAV does implement a fine-grained set of permissions. However,
a davfs2 resource is mounted with a single username and password.
Essentially, thus, mounting a DAV resource on a publicly accessible
place (e.g. /mnt) has the same effect as distributing the username
and password to each user with access to the system. And *this*
would be a security problem. :)

How does AFS/Coda work wrt this? I cannot imagine that every user of
a system with AFS mounts has unconditional read and write access to
those resources...

Quite the contrary; most AFS shares are mounted using Kerberos, such that
only processes with the necessary Kerberos ticket (or rather, AFS token,
which is acquired using the Kerberos ticket) can access the files.

Forgive me ignorance. Would the same situation happens
in say SMB/CIFS ? To the server, the authentication
would still be whoever mount it from the client side.

I don't think this is a bug(if it is at all) worth RC status.

SMB/CIFS mounts honor the uid, gid, fmask, dmask mount options which
restrict who is allowed to access files/directories under the mountpoint.

Having support for not exposing the entire mount point to access by
arbitrary users on the system really is a rather basic requirement, and
davfs is the only filesystem type I've heard of which doesn't support this
correctly in one form or another.

If I mount a SMB/CIFS share with umask 0700, nobody but myself can
enter the mounted hierarchy, or read/write files therein.

I don't want to do that without the maintainer's consent.  If the
package has severe security issues that won't be fixed in the
short-term, do we really want this in Debian?

It is only Debian *unstable*, but before I come across as
authoritative figure... I honestly do not know what to think of your
proposal. I think we might want to take this to debian-security.
Then again, I am not going to oppose if you file this bug. But
please do understand that I am not going to instigate your idea for
you.

Hello,

I have done a quick and brutal fix to this. Patch file is attached.

The fix:
- terminate, if run setuid. So only root can mount. Reason: davfs2 does
not enforce mount control by fstab. So if run setuid, any user could
mount with the uid of any other user.
- set uid and gid according to the values given as option. Set file mode
600 and directory mode 700. Only root and the user given as option may
use the file system.
- do not allow to change uid, gid and mode of any part of the mounted
file system.
- for every request (coda upcall) the requesting uid is checked against
the uid of the file system.

Rationale:
Checking is more restrictive than necessary. But this way it could be
done with little effort. I also think that a more sophisticated checking
of permissions should be done together with the redisign of other parts
of davfs2.

Greetings
Werner
