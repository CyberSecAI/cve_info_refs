    "Root cause": "An off-by-one error in the mod_ssl CRL verification callback.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Off-by-one overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A single null byte stack overflow, which could lead to denial of service by causing the current child process to die. The process would then be replaced by the web server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The Apache server must be configured to use a malicious CRL."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted, malicious CRL, and the Apache server must be configured to use CRLs. This requires some control over the server configuration or the ability to provide it with a crafted CRL via a configuration vulnerability. "
