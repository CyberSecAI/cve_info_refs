Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a format string flaw located in the `my_xlog()` function of the Oops! proxy server. This function is called by the `auth()` functions of the `passwd_mysql` and `passwd_pgsql` modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the use of a user-controlled string as the format string argument in a function like `printf`, which allows attackers to manipulate the program's execution flow or leak information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable Oops! proxy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP request sent to the Oops! proxy server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Oops! proxy server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the authentication modules of Oops! Specifically, when the proxy interacts with MySQL or PostgreSQL for user authentication.
- The Gentoo advisory specifies that the affected versions are those prior to `1.5.24_pre20050503`.
- The Debian advisory specifies that the issue is fixed in version `1.5.19.cvs.20010818-0.1woody1` for the stable distribution (woody).
- Both advisories confirm the CVE ID as CAN-2005-1121 (now CVE-2005-1121).
