- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the way Apple Mac OS X Tiger Dashboard identifies and executes widgets. It uses the `CFBundleIdentifier` property in the `Info.plist` file within a widget to identify it. If a user installs a widget with the same `CFBundleIdentifier` as a system widget, the user-installed widget will override and replace the system widget.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  **Insufficient Widget Validation:** Dashboard does not properly validate or warn users when a user-installed widget has the same `CFBundleIdentifier` as a system widget, leading to automatic replacement.
    -  **Automatic Execution of Downloaded Files:** Safari's default setting to automatically open "safe" files after downloading allows for automatic installation of malicious widgets.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can craft a malicious widget with the same bundle identifier as a system widget. If the user installs this malicious widget (either knowingly or unknowingly, due to Safari's default settings) , the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or code with the privileges of the user. The user would be unaware that they are no longer running the legitimate system widget.

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to convince a user to download and install a malicious widget. This could be done through social engineering, phishing, or by hosting the widget on a website and tricking a user into downloading and installing it. Safari's default setting of automatically opening safe files contributes to the attack.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create a widget and convince the victim to install it.
