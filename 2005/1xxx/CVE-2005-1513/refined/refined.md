{
  "CVE-2005-1513": {
    "Description": "Integer overflow in the stralloc_readyplus function in qmail, when running on 64 bit platforms with a large amount of virtual memory, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large SMTP request.",
    "Root cause": "An integer overflow occurs in the `stralloc_readyplus` function when allocating memory for a string. Specifically, the size of the buffer is incremented by one-eighth during reallocation, but this calculation is vulnerable to an integer overflow, leading to an undersized buffer allocation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based Buffer Overflow",
       "Inadequate Memory Limit"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution. The exploit involves sending a large SMTP request that triggers the integer overflow, followed by a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attacks via SMTP, specifically targeting the `qmail-local` program, which handles local mail delivery and is not memory-limited by default.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a very large SMTP request to the target. The attacker also needs to carefully craft the first few lines of the mail message to influence buffer reallocations, leading to overflows at specific memory locations."
