Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The BulletProof FTP Server v2.4.0.31 administrative interface, when accessed through the tray icon's "Show Server" option, launches Internet Explorer under the context of the LocalSystem account. This allows an attacker to abuse the "File -> Open" functionality of Internet Explorer to execute arbitrary commands with LocalSystem privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The core vulnerability lies in the ability to escalate privileges from a regular user to the LocalSystem account.
- **Unprotected Administrative Interface:** The administrative interface, which is accessible from the system tray icon, is not properly secured and allows for launching an external application (Internet Explorer) with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain full control over the affected system with LocalSystem privileges. This allows for actions including:
   - Reading, writing, modifying or deleting any file on the system.
   - Installing and running arbitrary software.
   - Modifying system configurations.
   - Creating or deleting user accounts.
   - Potentially compromising other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** The vulnerability requires the attacker to have local access to the system where the BulletProof FTP Server is installed and running.
- **GUI Interaction:** The attacker must interact with the system tray icon and the graphical interface of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local user access:** The attacker must have at least user level access to the system.
- **Ability to interact with system tray:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the tray icon.
- **Knowledge of exploit steps:** The attacker must know the steps necessary to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
- The vendor was notified, but there was no response. This indicates the vulnerability might not be patched.
- The exploit is simple and easily replicable.
- The exploit utilizes Internet Explorer's "File -> Open" dialog to navigate and open an executable.
