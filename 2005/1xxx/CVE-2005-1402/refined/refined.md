The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Mtp-Target: a format string vulnerability in the client and a server crash vulnerability.

**A] clients format string**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The client application uses a format string vulnerability when displaying messages received from other users or other text in the upper console.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Format string vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit all connected clients with a single crafted message.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted message to the client.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send messages to clients connected to a server.

**B] server crash**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The server attempts to allocate memory based on a client-provided size. A signed comparison checks if the requested size is greater than 1,000,000 bytes. By providing a negative value, the check is bypassed and the server attempts to allocate an extremely large amount of memory.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow/underflow leading to excessive memory allocation, signed comparison vulnerability.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Server crash due to failed memory allocation.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a message with a negative size parameter to the server.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send messages to the server.
