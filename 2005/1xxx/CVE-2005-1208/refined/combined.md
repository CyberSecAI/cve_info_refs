How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately-reported vulnerability. A vulnerability exists in HTML Help that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. The vulnerability is documented in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 98, 98 SE, ME | Windows 2000 | Windows XP Service Pack 1 | Windows XP Service Pack 2 | Windows Server 2003 | Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HTML Help Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-1208](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-1208) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical | Important |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The severity ratings for non-x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating systems versions as follows:

* The Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) severity rating is the same as the Windows XP Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) severity rating is the same as the Windows XP Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces several prior security updates. The security bulletin IDs and affected operating systems are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS02-055**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8678) | Replaced | Replaced | Not Applicable |
| [**MS03-044**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19860) | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced |
| [**MS04-023**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=27827) | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced |
| [**MS05-001**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38509) | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced |

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 896358](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/896358) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 896358](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/896358).

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin, this update includes several security changes.
This security update restricts the use of the InfoTech protocol (ms-its, its, mk:@msitstore) from processing content that is served from outside the Local Machine zone. This change may prevent certain kinds of Web-based applications from functioning correctly. To resolve this issue, the user or administrator can selectively enable this ability on a site-by-site basis. Alternatively, they can enable this ability based on the zone. Examples of zones include the Local intranet zone and the Trusted sites zone. This change is consistent with the default setting for this protocol in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.

## Vulnerability Details

#### HTML Help Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1208:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in HTML Help that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for HTML Help Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1208:

* Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 restricts the InfoTech protocol (ms-its, its, mk:@msitstore) from processing content that is served from outside the Local Machine zone. This change helps prevent remote attacks from the Internet zone and reduces the severity of this issue on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 systems.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also try to compromise a Web site to have it deliver a Web page that has malicious content to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.

  The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:

  + Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-040](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=19873) or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.
  + Use Internet Explorer 6 or a later version.
  + Use the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.

#### Workarounds for HTML Help Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1208:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Unregister HTML Help InfoTech Protocol**

  To help reduce the likelihood of a remote attack you can unregister the HTML Help InfoTech protocol. Follow these steps to unregister this protocol:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regsvr32 /u %windir%\system32\itss.dll**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.

     **Note** On Windows 98 and Windows Millennium Edition, replace "**system32**" with "**system**" in this command.
  2. A dialog box appears and confirms that the unregistration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.

     **Impact of Workaround:** All HTML Help functionality will be unavailable. This will affect the online Help in Windows or in any application that uses HTML Help functionality.

#### FAQ for HTML Help Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1208:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability occurs because HTML Help does not completely validate input data.

**What is HTML Help?**

Microsoft HTML Help is the standard help system for the Windows platform. Authors can use HTML Help to create online Help files for a software application or to create content for a multimedia title or for a Web site. For more information about how to create online Help files, visit the following [Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms670169.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous attacker who could display a specially crafted Web page to a user could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. It could also be possible to display malicious Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user view Web sites for an attack to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

Yes. Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition are critically affected by this vulnerability. A critical security update for these platforms is available and is provided as part of this security bulletin and can be downloaded from the [Windows Update Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130). For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that HTML Help validates data.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**How does this vulnerability relate to the HTML Help vulnerability that is addressed by MS05-001?**

Both vulnerabilities were in HTML Help. However, this update addresses a new vulnerability that was not addressed as part of MS05-001. MS05-001 helps protect against the vulnerability that is discussed in that bulletin, but does not address this new vulnerability.

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows Server 2003, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP2\KB896358\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 896358 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows XP (all versions)

**Prerequisites**
This security update requires Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1 or a later version. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 322389](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389).

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**
The update for this issue will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switches. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not backup files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Microsoft Windows XP:

**Windowsxp-kb896358-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB896358.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows XP:

**Windowsxp-kb896358-x86-enu /norestart**

For information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125).

**Restart Requirement**

This update does not require a restart. If the required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart. For more information about the reasons why you may be prompted to restart your computer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887012](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/887012).

**Removal Information**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

System administrators can also use the Spuninst.exe utility to remove this security update. The Spuninst.exe utility is located in the %Windir%\$NTUninstallKB896358$\Spuninst folder.

**Notes** The Windows XP security update is packaged as a dual-mode package. Dual-mode packages contain files for the original version of Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) and files for Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2).
For more information about dual-mode packages, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 328848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/328848).
When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:

* Windows XP SP2
  The installer copies the SP2QFE files to your system.
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)
  The installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system.

If you have not previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:

* Windows XP SP2
  The installer copies the SP2GDR files to your system.
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)
  The installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Note** For Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium), this security update is the same as the Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems security update. For Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, this security update is the same as the Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition security update.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB896358\Filelist

  For Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium):

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB896358\Filelist

  For Windows XP Professional x64

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB896358\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 896358 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows 2000 (all versions)

## Microsoft HTML Help vulnerable to integer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#851869

Original Release Date: 2005-06-14 | Last Revised: 2005-06-27

---

### Overview

Microsoft HTML Help contains an integer overflow vulnerability, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| **HTML Help**  The Microsoft [HTML Help](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconHH1Start.asp) system ". . . is the standard help system for the Windows platform." HTML Help components can be compiled to ". . . compress HTML, graphic, and other files into a relatively small compiled help (.chm) file. . ." The resulting compiled Help (CHM) file can then ". . . be distributed with a software application, or downloaded from the Web." The Help Viewer application ". . . uses the underlying components of Microsoft Internet Explorer to display help content. It supports HTML, ActiveX, Java, scripting languages (JScript, and Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition). . ."**The InfoTech Storage Format**CHM files use the Microsoft InfoTech Storage format (ITS). IE can access components within CHM files (via the [IStorage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/stg/stg/istorage.asp) interface) using several protocol handlers: ms-its, ms-itss, its, mk:@MSITStore.For example, the following URL references an HTML file within a CHM file hosted on a remote web site:  ms-its:http://www.example.com/directory/path/compiledhelpfile.chm:/htmlfile.html  This URL references a local CHM file:  its:file://c:\directory\path\compiledhelpfile.chm:/htmlfile.html  **The Problem**Microsoft HTML Help contains an integer overflow vulnerability. A CHM file with a specially crafted size field can cause a buffer overflow in HTML Help, which can corrupt heap memory. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a victim to view a specially crafted CHM file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. By using one of the InfoTech Storage Format protocols, such as ms-its, an attacker can cause open an arbitrary CHM file as the result of viewing an HTML document (web page, HTML email). |
