## Apple Mac OS X vulnerable to buffer overflow via vpnd daemon

#### Vulnerability Note VU#706838

Original Release Date: 2005-05-16 | Last Revised: 2005-05-24

---

### Overview

Apple Mac OS X contains a buffer overflow in vpnd that could allow a local, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Description

| Mac OS X includes a VPN server called vpnd, which is installed setuid root by default. vpnd fails to validate the length of the Server\_id parameter. The Server\_id setting may be configured from the command line by using the -i option. Server\_id is referenced by the com.apple.RemoteAccessServers.plist file in the /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration directory to load the appropriate configuration file. Using a specially crafted Server\_id parameter, an authenticated local attacker could execute arbitrary code with privileges of the vpnd process.  Note that com.apple.RemoteAccessServers.plist is only present by default on Mac OS X Server. On a standard Mac OS X install, the file must be created manually or by using the graphical network configuration tools. |
