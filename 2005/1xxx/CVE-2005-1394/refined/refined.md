Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2005-1394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Unix versions of ESRI ArcGIS products due to:
    *   **Format string vulnerabilities:** Present in `lockmgr` and `wservice` binaries.
    *   **Buffer overflow vulnerabilities:** Present in `asmaster`, `asuser`, `asutility`, `se`, and `asrecovery` binaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The `lockmgr` and `wservice` binaries improperly handle format strings within the `ARCHOME` environment variable.
    *   By controlling the `ARCHOME` environment variable, an attacker can inject format specifiers, leading to arbitrary memory reads and writes.

*  **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Multiple binaries, including `asmaster`, `asuser`, `asutility`, `se`, and `asrecovery`, are vulnerable to buffer overflows.
    *   These overflows occur when the binaries process excessively long input, leading to a write outside of the allocated memory buffers.

*   **Setuid/Setgid Binaries:**
    * The vulnerable binaries are setuid root and setgid, meaning they execute with elevated privileges when run by any user. This escalates the impact of any exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
    *   The format string vulnerabilities can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
    *   The buffer overflow vulnerabilities, when successfully exploited, also allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

*   **Privilege Escalation:**
    *   A local attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to gain root privileges on the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Environment Variable Manipulation:** For format string vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to set the `ARCHOME` environment variable.
*   **Command-Line Arguments:** For buffer overflows, the attacker needs to supply excessively long command line arguments to the vulnerable binaries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system with the ability to execute the affected binaries.
*   **Ability to set environment variables**
*   **Knowledge of format string and buffer overflow exploitation techniques.**

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerable binaries are setuid root. This means that a successful exploit allows any local user to gain full root access.
*   The vulnerability was confirmed on Solaris and IRIX systems, and it is believed that all Unix ArcInfo installs are affected.
*   ESRI has provided patches for the vulnerabilities.
*   The provided exploit code targets the format string vulnerability in `wservice` and is designed for Solaris.
*   The original vulnerability report contains a basic timeline of the bug discovery, including the dates of internal communication and the public disclosure.
