{
  "cveId": "CVE-2005-1689",
  "rootCause": "The `krb5_recvauth()` function in MIT Kerberos 5 contains a double-free vulnerability.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "The `recvauth_common()` helper function calls `krb5_read_message()` and then unconditionally calls `krb5_xfree()` on the allocated buffer. If the sendauth version or application version string does not match the expected value, an additional `krb5_xfree()` is performed on the same buffer, leading to a double-free."
  ],
  "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of programs using `krb5_recvauth()`. This includes `kpropd` (potentially compromising the entire Kerberos realm) and remote login programs running with root privileges. Unsuccessful attempts may lead to denial of service by crashing the target program.",
  "attackVectors": [
    "An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted request to a vulnerable service that uses `krb5_recvauth()` to trigger the double-free."
  ],
  "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable service and to cause a version string mismatch to occur during the authentication process."
