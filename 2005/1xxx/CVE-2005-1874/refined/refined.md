  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The dzip utility is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks when extracting archives.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of filenames within archives during extraction allows for directory traversal."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create a specially crafted archive that, when extracted, can write files to arbitrary locations on the file system, potentially overwriting existing files if the user is tricked into using the force overwrite option.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted .dz archive files."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious .dz archive file and convince a user to extract the archive using the vulnerable version of dzip."
