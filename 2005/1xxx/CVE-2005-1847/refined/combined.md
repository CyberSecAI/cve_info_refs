## Details

| VuXML ID | 99b5cfa5-d3d2-11d9-8ffb-00061bc2ad93 |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery | 2005-01-20 |
| Entry | 2005-06-03 |

Stanislav Brabec discovered errors in yamt's path name
handling that lead to buffer overflows and directory traversal
issues. When processing a file with a maliciously crafted ID3
tag, yamt might overwrite arbitrary files or possibly execute
arbitrary code.

The SuSE package ChangeLog contains:

> * Several security fixes (#49337):
> * directory traversal in rename
> * directory traversal in sort
> * buffer overflow in sort
> * buffer overflow in rename
