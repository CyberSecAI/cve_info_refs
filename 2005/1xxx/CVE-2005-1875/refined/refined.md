Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `list.php` script of Exhibit Engine. Specifically, the script directly incorporates user-supplied values from POST parameters into SQL queries without escaping special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of blind SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `$search_row`, `$sort_row`, `$order`, and `$perpage` variables.  The application does not directly output the results of the SQL queries. However, the attacker can infer information by observing the changes in the application behavior based on the boolean results of the injected SQL.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract arbitrary database entries using blind SQL injection, potentially gaining access to sensitive data such as user credentials or other application data.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on the database configuration and the information exposed, an attacker might be able to escalate the attack to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP POST requests targeting the `list.php` script.
- **Manipulated Query Parameters:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `search_row`, `sort_row`, `order` and `perpage` POST parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Exhibit Engine application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker requires a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques and how to exploit blind SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Additional details from the analysis:**
-The vulnerability is present in Exhibit Engine versions 1.22 and 1.54 RC4, and likely other versions.
-The vendor was notified, and a workaround was published.
-The vulnerability is specifically located in `list.php`
