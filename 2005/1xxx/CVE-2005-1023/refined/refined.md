The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PHP-Nuke versions 6.x to 7.6:

**1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization in multiple modules allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Weaknesses:** Several parameters in the `Search`, `FAQ`, `banners`, and `Encyclopedia` modules are vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject JavaScript code that executes in a user's browser, leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, and other unauthorized actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code in vulnerable parameters. Example vulnerable parameters are `author`, `bid`, `ltr`, and `categories`. The attacker can also use a POST form to inject malicious JavaScript through an input field.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious code and entice victims to click them.

**2. Full Path Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The PHP application displays verbose error messages that reveal the full server paths.
*  **Weaknesses:** Direct access to specific module files without proper parameter handling, triggers PHP errors that expose the full path.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can learn the server's file system structure, which aids in further reconnaissance for other potential vulnerabilities and exploitation.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Accessing vulnerable modules with specific operations that cause error conditions, triggering the display of full paths in error messages. Examples include accessing `modules.php` with `Your_Account` module and `op` parameters as userinfo or my_headlines, or accessing `Encyclopedia` module with search `op` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs only to access a crafted URL.
