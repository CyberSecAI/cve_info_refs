Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2005-1687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary cause is the insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the WordPress application, specifically in post titles and content, and the `tb_id` parameter in `wp-trackback.php`. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input sanitization in post titles and content allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Specifically, the vulnerability exists in how WordPress handles user input for post titles and content. By inserting malicious script tags or iframe tags, attackers could execute arbitrary code within the context of a user's browser.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `tb_id` parameter in `wp-trackback.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the absence of proper input sanitization and lack of quotes in SQL queries. This allows attackers to insert SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   **Cookie Theft:** Attackers can steal cookies, potentially compromising user sessions and allowing unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can inject malicious HTML to alter the appearance and content of the website, possibly redirecting users to other malicious sites.
    *   **Malicious Code Execution:** Injecting JavaScript allows attackers to execute arbitrary code within the user's browser, potentially performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (password hashes).
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Though not explicitly stated as a direct impact, SQL injection could also be leveraged to modify data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   **Post Titles and Content:** Injecting malicious code into the title or body of a post.
    *   Specific examples include injecting `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` or `<iframe src=<http://othersite/sb.php>>`
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **`wp-trackback.php`:** Manipulating the `tb_id` parameter via a crafted URL to inject SQL commands.
    *   Example payload: `wp-trackback.php?tb_id=1%20union%20select%200,user_pass%20from%20 wp_users&url=bla&title=bla`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   **Authenticated User with Posting Access:** Attackers need to have the ability to create posts or comments. This could be an administrator or a lower level user with posting permissions.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress instance to send the crafted URL containing the SQL injection payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that the initial response to these vulnerabilities by the WordPress developers was to downplay the severity, which caused concern within the Gentoo security team.
*   The Gentoo team initially removed `templates.php` as a workaround and later masked the `www-apps/wordpress` package due to the slow response from upstream.
*   The issue with `iframe` injection was not fully addressed in the first fix (1.5.1), and SQL injection vulnerabilities were also discovered later.
*   The Gentoo Security team ultimately released a GLSA (Gentoo Linux Security Advisory) to inform users about the combined risks of these vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities are resolved in version 1.5.1.2, which was subsequently released and stabilized.
