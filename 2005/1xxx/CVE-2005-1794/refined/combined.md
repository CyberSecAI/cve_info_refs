How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ICS Medical Advisory
# Philips Intellispace Portal ISP Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedFebruary 27, 2018
Alert CodeICSMA-18-058-02

## OVERVIEW

Philips reported vulnerabilities in the Philips’ IntelliSpace Portal (ISP), an advanced visualization and image analysis system. Philips is creating a software update to mitigate these vulnerabilities in the affected products. Additionally, they are issuing mitigating controls for some vulnerabilities.

Some vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

Exploits that target some vulnerabilities are publicly available.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Philips reports that these vulnerabilities affect the following versions of the ISP:

* IntelliSpace Portal, all 8.0.x versions, and
* IntelliSpace Portal, all 7.0.x versions.

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, create denial of service conditions, or execute arbitrary code.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment and specific clinical usage.

## BACKGROUND

Philips is a global company that maintains offices in many countries around the world, including countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America.

The Philips ISP processes clinical images from different modalities and enables advanced visualization of the images. ISP systems are deployed across the Healthcare and Public Health sectors. Philips estimates these products are used worldwide.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

The ISP has multiple input validation vulnerabilities that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the application to crash.

## MITIGATION

Philips will release an updated version of the ISP in the coming months that will address these vulnerabilities. Additionally, Philips’ evaluation of Operating System security patches is ongoing, and after appropriate testing , the patches and mitigating controls are posted on Philips’ InCenter. ISP users are recommended to obtain available mitigating controls by accessing their InCenter account at this location:

<http://incenter.medical.philips.com>

Users with questions regarding their specific ISP installations are advised by Philips to contact their local Philips service support team or their regional service support.

Philips’ contact information is available at the following location:

<https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions>

Please see the Philips product security website for the latest security information for Philips products:

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate all medical devices and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
