The provided content describes a vulnerability in Sudo version 1.6.8p7.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a failure in Sudo to properly handle a blank password followed by a CTRL+C input. This causes Sudo to grant root privileges to the user without requiring a valid password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation and handling of CTRL+C during password entry.
- Failure to terminate the process securely when CTRL+C is input during password prompt.
- Incorrect privilege escalation when a blank password is provided, resulting in elevated root privileges without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can gain root privileges on the system without needing the root password.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker needs to be able to run the `sudo` command, and then type a blank password followed by CTRL+C.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have a valid user account on the system and be able to execute the `sudo` command.
