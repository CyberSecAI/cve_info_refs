  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-1989",
      "description": "A cross-domain vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow information disclosure or remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page. The malicious Web page could potentially allow remote code execution if it is viewed by a user. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, significant user interaction and social engineering is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
      "root_cause": "The process by which certain URLs are interpreted when browsing from a Web page to a Web folder view using WebDAV. URLs are not properly validated by the Internet Explorer cross-domain security model.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-domain vulnerability",
        "Improper URL validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Information disclosure or remote code execution, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious Web page",
         "Social engineering to persuade users to visit the page and interact with it"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to create and host a malicious web page and persuade a user to visit it.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is mitigated by the Restricted sites zone preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, clicking a link in an e-mail message can still trigger the vulnerability via a web-based attack. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Server 2003 and the Local Machine zone lockdown on Windows XP SP2 also mitigate this vulnerability.",
