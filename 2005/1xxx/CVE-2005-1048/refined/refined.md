The provided content relates to CVE-2005-1048. It describes multiple vulnerabilities found in PostNuke 0.760-RC3.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerabilities stem from insufficient input validation and sanitization within the PostNuke application. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied inputs before using them in SQL queries or displaying them on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** Vulnerable parameters in modules.php allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Several parameters in admin.php and user.php are vulnerable to XSS attacks, allowing for the injection of arbitrary Javascript code.
- **Path Disclosure:**  The Reviews module is vulnerable to a path disclosure vulnerability, revealing the full server path through an error message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially manipulate or extract sensitive data from the database.
- **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session, which could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions.
- **Path Disclosure:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, which can be helpful in planning further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Requests:** All vulnerabilities are triggered by crafting malicious GET requests with manipulated query parameters to vulnerable scripts such as `admin.php`, `modules.php`, and `user.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable PostNuke instance.
- **Basic knowledge of HTTP:** The attacker should know how to manipulate HTTP GET requests.
- **No privilege required:** The vulnerabilities are accessible to unauthenticated users and do not require any privileges within the application.
