  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the non-constant time execution of the AES algorithm, primarily due to variable access times of memory locations based on their index and whether they are cached. This is further exacerbated by cache behavior including limited associativity, and interference from other operations like stores, interrupts and bank conflicts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cache-timing side-channel vulnerability",
    "Variable timing due to cache hits and misses",
    "L1 vs L2 cache access time differences",
    "Limited cache associativity causing conflicts",
    "Interrupts causing cache eviction",
    "Load/store conflicts within the cache",
    "Cache bank conflicts",
    "Input-dependent branches",
	"S-box lookups are not constant time"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Complete recovery of the AES encryption key used by the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out remotely by sending specifically crafted network packets to the server and observing the time it takes the server to process them.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target server and measure the time it takes for the server to respond. The attacker also needs a machine with similar hardware to the target system for profiling the timing differences. The attacker does not require physical access to the server."
