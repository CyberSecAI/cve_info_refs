Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-1157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of malicious search plugins to execute JavaScript code within the security context of the currently active tab in Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey browsers. This occurs because search plugins were not properly restricted in terms of the actions they could perform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious search plugins could inject and execute JavaScript, enabling them to bypass the same-origin policy.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to the active tab's context, the malicious plugin could gain access to privileged pages (like about:config or about:plugins), potentially leading to further exploitation.
- **Plugin Overwriting:** A malicious plugin could silently replace an existing plugin by using the same filename and a long server path to obscure the overwriting during the install confirmation dialog.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** Attackers could steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data from the displayed page could be stolen.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** On privileged pages, the injected JavaScript could gain system-level access or execute malicious code, like installing malware.
- **Search History Tracking:** Malicious plugins could track a user's search history.
- **Result Manipulation:** Attackers could inject their own results into search results pages, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Search Plugin Installation:** Attackers would need to trick users into installing malicious search plugins from untrusted websites.
- **Overwriting Existing Plugins:** Attackers could overwrite existing search plugins with their malicious versions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create and host malicious search plugins:** The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted search plugin.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to convince users to install the malicious plugin.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by restricting search plugins from using javascript URLs for search actions and preventing search plugins from overwriting existing plugins without explicit user action.
- Users should avoid installing plugins from untrusted sources.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**
- The vulnerability was reported by Michael Krax.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox 1.0.3 and Mozilla Suite 1.7.7.
- The bug report (Bug 290037) provides a more technical discussion of the issue and its resolution.
- The fix involved ensuring search plugins only support HTTP.
- The vulnerability was also assigned identifiers from Secunia (SA14938) and CVE (CAN-2005-1156).
