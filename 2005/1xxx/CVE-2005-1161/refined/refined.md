The provided content details multiple SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in OneWorldStore.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the page. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection exist in various ASP scripts (`owAddItem.asp`, `owListProduct.asp`, `owProductDetail.asp`). Specifically, the `idProduct`, `bSpecials`, `idCategory` parameters are vulnerable.
*   **XSS:** Multiple instances of XSS exist in various ASP scripts (`owContactUs.asp`, `owListProduct.asp`, and `owProductDetail.asp`). Specifically, the `sName`, `sEmail`, `bSub`, parameters in combination with a review form are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Attackers can potentially gain access to the database, allowing them to steal or modify sensitive information.
    *   Error messages provide database structure details, that attackers can leverage.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser.
    *   This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other harmful actions.
    *   Permanent XSS can lead to cookie theft of anyone who visits the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating URL parameters, such as `idProduct`, `bSpecials` and `idCategory`, with malicious SQL code.
*   **XSS:** By manipulating URL parameters or form input fields, such as `sName`, `sEmail` and `bSub`, with malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with malicious parameters or fill out web forms.
