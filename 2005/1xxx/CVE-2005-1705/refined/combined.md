How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

gdb security update (RHSA-2005-801)

Original Release Date: January 16, 2006

Last Revised: November 8, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-015

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

GDB, the GNU debugger, allows debugging of programs written in C,
C++, and
other languages by executing them in a controlled fashion, then
printing
their data.

Several integer overflow bugs were found in gdb. If a user is tricked
into
processing a specially crafted executable file, it may allow the
execution
of arbitrary code as the user running gdb. The Common Vulnerabilities
and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CAN-2005-1704](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1704) to this issue.

A bug was found in the way gdb loads .gdbinit files. When a user
executes
gdb, the local directory is searched for a .gdbinit file which is
then
loaded. It is possible for a local user to execute arbitrary commands
as
the user running gdb by placing a malicious .gdbinit file in a
location
where gdb may be run. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CAN-2005-1705](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1705) to this issue.

Several Avaya System products utilize gdb, however only Avaya
services personnel
have access to gdb, therefore lowering the risk of exploitation.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-801.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with gdb installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | 1.x - 3.0 | Low | Upgrade to CM 3.1 or later |
| Avaya Sip EnablementServices (SES) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. An update is being considered for a future release. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below. An update is being considered for a future release. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 1.x - 2.x | Low | Update to MSS 3.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below. An update is being considered for a future release. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of gdb, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected
by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may
be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | all? | Low | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. Red
Hat).

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com/) and through your
Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

A useful feature, but it isnt hard to imagine a method of social engineering an administrator in to compromising his account, eg  user: "help! when i run lynx in /foo it dumps core, please check it out." admin helpfully runs gdb in /foo and user has silently taken over his account.  or perhaps compromise a colleagues account if they share access to cvs repository, etc, etc.  example:  $ printf "set args 0wned\nexec /bin/echo\nr\n" > /tmp/.gdbinit $ cd /tmp $ gdb ... Using host libthread_db library "/lib/libthread_db.so.1". 0wned  Program exited normally. (gdb)  I think we should only allow ~/.gdbinit, if the user wants the feature they can simply add "source .gdbinit", perhaps this can be added with some comments explaining the situation to the example gdbinit we distribute.  a few things other things that might improve this if other disagree:  * confirm current user owns the .gdbinit file. * print lots of warnings that gdb should only be started in trusted directories. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-08 13:29:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 55708](attachment.cgi?id=55708 "gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=55708&action=edit "gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=55708&action=diff "gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch")] gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch  something like this is what you looking for? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-08 13:39:45 UTC  ``` solar: looks good, should be an improvement, and can still be overridden (to read other users .gdbinit's) if a user requires by adding 'source .gdbinit' to ~/.gdbinit. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-08 13:54:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 55710](attachment.cgi?id=55710 "use existing stat()") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=55710&action=edit "use existing stat()"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=55710&action=diff "use existing stat()")] use existing stat()  save the overhead from another stat, one already exists a little earlier. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-08 15:46:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 55719](attachment.cgi?id=55719 "gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=55719&action=edit "gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=55719&action=diff "gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch")] gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch  adds check to ensure if our .gdbinit file was in pwd it's not world writeable  either using existing stat. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-08 15:53:02 UTC  ``` note I've not tested that yet. will do in a few mins. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-08 16:13:43 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 55721](attachment.cgi?id=55721 "gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=55721&action=edit "gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=55721&action=diff "gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch")] gdb-6.3-gdbinit-stat.patch  ok other patch had an extra ) in it.

I think we should 'set history filename ~/.gdb_history' in the gdbinit we distribute with some comments, so that users who enable saving history across sessions can see this option should be set as well. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-23 07:39:07 UTC  ``` solar/taviso any news on this one? ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-24 13:04:03 UTC  ``` Fixed in .gdbinit handling in gdb-6.3-r2 and left the history alone as not all  arches have a default /etc/skel/.gdbinit file.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# gdb: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200505-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU debugger,
potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/gdb** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.3-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.3-r3** |

### Background

gdb is the GNU project's debugger, facilitating the analysis and
debugging of applications. The BFD library provides a uniform method of
accessing a variety of object file formats.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered an
integer overflow in the BFD library, resulting in a heap overflow. A
review also showed that by default, gdb insecurely sources
initialisation files from the working directory.

### Impact

Successful exploitation would result in the execution of arbitrary code
on loading a specially crafted object file or the execution of
arbitrary commands.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All gdb users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/gdb-6.3-r3"
```

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
