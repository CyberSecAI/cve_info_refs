Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2005-1320:

**Summary:**

The provided content indicates that Mnemo version 1.1.4 addresses an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability. However, the specific details of this vulnerability are not provided.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is an unspecified flaw that allows for XSS attacks.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. XSS vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens, potentially hijacking user accounts.
    *   Deface the website or redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   Potentially gain access to sensitive information displayed within the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The specific attack vector is not mentioned, but generally XSS vulnerabilities are exploited by injecting malicious scripts into user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized before being displayed on a web page. This can include injecting scripts into notes or memo fields in the Mnemo application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious script into an area that Mnemo renders to other users without proper sanitization. This could include having an account on the application or potentially using social engineering methods if the injection can occur via other methods than direct account interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content does not provide specific details on the exact location of the vulnerability or the nature of the injected script.
*   The release notes for Mnemo 1.1.4 mention fixing an XSS vulnerability. The lack of detail is common in release notes.
*   The provided Secunia content does not provide any specific information about CVE-2005-1320. It's a general overview of their vulnerability research.

**In conclusion:**
This content confirms the existence of an XSS vulnerability fixed in Mnemo 1.1.4, but lacks the technical details of the vulnerability.
