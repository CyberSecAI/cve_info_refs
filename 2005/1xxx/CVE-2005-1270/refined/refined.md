Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `check_update.sh` script and the main `rkhunter` script insecurely create temporary files with predictable filenames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The scripts create temporary files in a predictable location without sufficient protection against symlink attacks.
- **Predictable Filenames:** The predictable filenames allow an attacker to anticipate the names of the temporary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local attacker can create symbolic links in the directory where the temporary files are created. When `rkhunter` or `check_update.sh` runs, these symbolic links will cause files elsewhere in the filesystem to be overwritten with the privileges of the user executing the script (often root).
- This can lead to system compromise by modifying critical files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker must be able to create symbolic links in the temporary files directory.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is described in GLSA 200504-25.
- The vulnerability affects `app-forensics/rkhunter` versions prior to 1.2.3-r1.
- The vulnerability was reported by Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen and Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Team.
- The provided content includes a suggested fix by upgrading the rkhunter package.
