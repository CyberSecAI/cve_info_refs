  "cve": "CVE-2005-1918",
  "description": "The GNU tar program saves many files together in one archive and can restore individual files (or all of the files) from that archive. In 2002, a path traversal flaw was found in the way GNU tar extracted archives. A malicious user could create a tar archive that could write to arbitrary files to which the user running GNU tar has write access (CVE-2002-0399). Red Hat included a backported security patch to correct this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, and an erratum for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users was issued. During internal testing, we discovered that our backported security patch contained an incorrect optimization and therefore was not sufficient to completely correct this vulnerability. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name CVE-2005-1918 to this issue. Users of tar should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a replacement backported patch to correct this issue.",
