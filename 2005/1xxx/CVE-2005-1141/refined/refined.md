The provided content details two vulnerabilities in GOCR, both related to processing PNM image files.

**Vulnerability 1: Integer Overflow (Using netpbm library)**

*   **Root cause:** An integer overflow occurs when calculating the size of the image buffer (`p->x * p->y`) in the `readpgm()` function, when the netpbm library is used.
*   **Weakness:** The multiplication of image width (`p->x`) and height (`p->y`) can result in an integer overflow, causing the `malloc()` call to allocate a buffer that is much smaller than required.
*   **Impact:** When processing a specially crafted PNM file with large dimensions, the subsequent write operations to the image buffer in the `for` loop will result in a heap overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered when opening a malicious PNM file.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious PNM file.

**Vulnerability 2: Heap Overflow (Without netpbm library)**

*   **Root cause:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `readpgm()` function (when the netpbm library is not used) due to an incorrect loop termination condition.
*   **Weakness:** The loop that reads pixel data continues reading beyond the allocated buffer size, writing into adjacent memory. The loop condition `i < nx*ny*3` is incorrect, as `pic` is allocated with size `nx*ny`, but the loop iterates as if each pixel takes 3 bytes.
*   **Impact:** This leads to a heap buffer overflow when reading a crafted PNM file with more data than expected. This could allow arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered when opening a malicious PNM file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious PNM file.

The provided content gives a detailed description of two distinct vulnerabilities in GOCR's handling of PNM files, including root causes, affected code, and proof-of-concept exploits.
