Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2005-1856:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The backup-manager's CD-burning feature uses a hardcoded filename for logging in a world-writable directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symlink Attack:** The vulnerability lies in the use of a hardcoded filename in a world-writable directory, which makes it susceptible to a symlink attack. An attacker could create a symbolic link with the same name as the log file, pointing to a sensitive file on the system. When the backup-manager writes to the log file, it would instead write to the target of the symlink, potentially leading to arbitrary file overwriting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A successful symlink attack could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the system with the log data. This could lead to various impacts such as system compromise, data corruption, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access, as the attacker needs to be able to create symlinks in the world-writable directory where the log file is created.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to create a symlink in the world-writable directory used by backup-manager.
