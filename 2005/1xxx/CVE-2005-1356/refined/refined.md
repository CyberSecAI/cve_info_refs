The provided content describes vulnerabilities in the `includer.cgi` script.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `includer.cgi` script improperly handles user-supplied input, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary files and execution of shell commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The script directly includes files specified in the query string, without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to read sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The script executes shell commands specified in the query string, prefixed with a pipe symbol (`|`), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While less detailed, the report suggests a potential for XSS by injecting JavaScript code into the query string.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files, potentially revealing user credentials, system configuration, and other confidential information.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can gain complete control of the server by executing arbitrary commands.
- **XSS:** Attackers can potentially steal cookies or execute malicious scripts on users' browsers.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerabilities are exploited through HTTP requests with manipulated query string parameters in the `includer.cgi` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `includer.cgi` script. No special privileges or local access is required.
