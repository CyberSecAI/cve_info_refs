Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** A double expansion error exists in the `m_build_buffer_from_buffer()` function of the `monkeyd` HTTP server, leading to a format string vulnerability.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability:** A syntax error in `monkeyd` causes it to zero out unallocated memory when a zero-byte file is requested. This is due to an incorrect `memset` call within the `M_free` function, which attempts to `memset` the size of the pointer rather than the size of the memory pointed to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:**  The `m_build_buffer_from_buffer` function does not properly handle format specifiers within the input, allowing an attacker to manipulate program execution flow.
*   **Memory Corruption/DoS:** The incorrect `memset` usage leads to memory corruption and potentially a denial-of-service by writing to unallocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running `monkeyd`.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can disrupt the normal operation of the web server, making it unavailable for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing format specifiers (e.g., `%n`) to the server.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability is triggered by requesting a zero-byte file from the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is mentioned as a prerequisite, making these vulnerabilities remotely exploitable.

**Additional Details**

* The `memset` issue arose because the `sizeof()` operator was used on the pointer itself instead of the underlying allocated memory.
* The format string vulnerability is triggered by inputting specially crafted format specifiers, which are then processed incorrectly by `m_build_buffer_from_buffer()` function

**Summary**
CVE-2005-1122 is associated with a format string vulnerability in `monkeyd`. A separate but related vulnerability, which was assigned CVE-2005-1123, caused a denial of service by using `memset` incorrectly, both of which were present in versions prior to 0.9.1.
