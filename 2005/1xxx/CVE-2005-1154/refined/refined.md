{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to define a getter/setter on the `window.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__` object, which is not cleared when a new page is loaded, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Global scope pollution: The ability to modify the prototype chain of the window object allows persistent changes to the global scope across page loads.",
       "Uncleaned object prototype: The browser fails to reset the prototype chain when loading a new document, allowing previously set getter/setters to persist."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious script can define a getter/setter for a global variable used by another site. When the user browses to the targeted site, the malicious getter/setter is executed, potentially leading to:\n\n- Stealing cookies and sensitive page content.\n- Performing actions on the user's behalf without consent (e.g., making purchases, deleting webmail).",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a page that defines a getter/setter on `window.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__`. When the user navigates to another page, even from a different domain, this getter/setter persists and can be triggered if the new page uses a global variable with the same name.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in the user's browser. This could be achieved through various means, like a compromised website or a malicious ad."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "fixed_versions": [
      "Firefox 1.0.3",
      "Mozilla Suite 1.7.7"
    ],
     "workaround": "Open a new window or tab before going to any site requiring a log in or containing sensitive information. Or disable javascript.",
