Confirming.
If you set browser.dom.global\_scope\_pollution.disabled to true (undoing the IE
compat fixes in [bug 256932](/show_bug.cgi?id=256932 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose elements by their id/name in the global scope (quirks mode only, for IE compat) (GlobalScopePolluter)")) you can still do this, but using only two \_\_proto\_\_

That is the last object on the prototype chain, namely Object.prototype. We
should be resetting that to a new one created for a new Object ctor on new doc
load, of course.

Attached patch

[Make context re-initialization work right again.](attachment.cgi?id=180219&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=180219&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=289675&attachment=180219)

Not sure when or how this broke, didn't have time to dig into that yet. But the
problem is that XPConnect is unable to find Object.prototype when we're
re-initializing a context (i.e. during page transition), so it ends up using
the old one it had. That's bad, and there was code that printed out a warning
for that, but I hadn't been observant enough to notice that. I turned on that
code for everyone now to hopefully catch this earlier if it happens again.
So this patch makes it so that we can resolve standard classes during context
re-initialization. Pretty straight forward.

Make context re-initialization work right again.
I think that NS\_WARNING should be an NS\_ERROR. Is that going to turn tinderbox
orange? If so, we still have a potential security hole.

This caused some pretty weird (though possibly correct) code flow during context
init. I filed [bug 295606](/show_bug.cgi?id=295606 "RESOLVED FIXED - Reentry of JS_ResolveStandardClass due to fix for bug 289675") on that.Depends on: [295606](/show_bug.cgi?id=295606 "RESOLVED FIXED - Reentry of JS_ResolveStandardClass due to fix for bug 289675")

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-36

## Cross-site Scripting through global scope pollution

Announced
April 15, 2005
Reporter
shutdown
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.3
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.7

### Description

As you browse from site to site each new page should start with a clean
slate. shutdown reports a technique that pollutes the global scope of
a window in a way that persists from page to page.
A malicious script could define a setter function
for a variable known to be used by a popular site, and if the user
does browse to that site the malicious script will run in that page.
This would allows the setter script to steal cookies or the contents
of the page, or potentially perform actions on the user's behalf
(such as make purchases or delete webmail) depending heavily on
how the site was designed.

The objects persist until the window or tab is closed.

### Workaround

Open a new window or tab before going to any site requiring a log in
or containing sensitive information. Or disable javascript.

# Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200504-18**

New Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Suite releases fix new security
vulnerabilities, including memory disclosure and various ways of executing
JavaScript code with elevated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.7** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.7** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that includes a
mail and news reader. Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation browser
from the Mozilla project.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla Suite
and Mozilla Firefox:

* Vladimir V. Perepelitsa reported a memory disclosure bug in
  JavaScript's regular expression string replacement when using an
  anonymous function as the replacement argument (CAN-2005-0989).
* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 discovered that Chrome UI code was overly trusting DOM
  nodes from the content window, allowing privilege escalation via DOM
  property overrides.
* Michael Krax reported a possibility to run JavaScript code with
  elevated privileges through the use of javascript: favicons.
* Michael Krax also discovered that malicious Search plugins could
  run JavaScript in the context of the displayed page or stealthily
  replace existing search plugins.
* shutdown discovered a technique to pollute the global scope of a
  window in a way that persists from page to page.
* Doron Rosenberg discovered a possibility to run JavaScript with
  elevated privileges when the user asks to "Show" a blocked popup that
  contains a JavaScript URL.
* Finally, Georgi Guninski reported missing Install object instance
  checks in the native implementations of XPInstall-related JavaScript
  objects.

The following Firefox-specific vulnerabilities have also been
discovered:

* Kohei Yoshino discovered a new way to abuse the sidebar panel to
  execute JavaScript with elevated privileges.
* Omar Khan reported that the Plugin Finder Service can be tricked to
  open javascript: URLs with elevated privileges.

### Impact

The various JavaScript execution with elevated privileges issues can be
exploited by a remote attacker to install malicious code or steal data.
The memory disclosure issue can be used to reveal potentially sensitive
information. Finally, the cache pollution issue and search plugin abuse
can be leveraged in cross-site-scripting attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.3"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.3"
```

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.7"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.7"
```
