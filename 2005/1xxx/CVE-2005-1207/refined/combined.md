How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Web Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1207:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows processes Web Client requests that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerable to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Web Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1207:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.
* By default, the Web Client service is disabled in Windows Server 2003. An administrator would have to manually enable this service for the system to become vulnerable to this issue.
* Attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service condition.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. By default, the Internet Connection Firewall that is provided as part of Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003 blocks the affected ports from responding to network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
* The [Windows Server 2003 Security Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/prodtech/windowsserver2003/w2003hg/sgch00.mspx) recommends disabling the Web Client service. Environments that comply with these guidelines would be at a reduced risk from this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Web Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1207:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable the Web Client service**

  Disabling the Web Client service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Web Client service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel.** Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **WebClient**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.

     You can also stop and disable the Web Client service by using the following command at the command prompt:

  `sc stop WebClient & sc config WebClient start= disabled`

  **Impact of Workaround:** If the Web Client service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. If the Web Client service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. Windows Server 2003 users will not be able to use the "Open as Web Folder" functionality.
* **Use the Group Policy settings to disable the WebClient service on all affected systems that do not require this feature.**
  Because the Web Client service is a possible attack vector, disable the service by using the Group Policy settings. You can disable the startup of this service at either the local, site, domain, or organizational-unit level by using Group Policy object functionality in Windows 2000 domain environments or in Windows Server 2003 domain environments.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If the Web Client service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. If the Web Client service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. Windows Server 2003 users will not be able to use the "Open as Web Folder" functionality.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall:**

  Although WebDAV uses TCP port 80 for outbound communication, TCP ports 139 and 445 can be used inbound to attempt to connect to this service and try to exploit this vulnerability. Blocking them at the firewall can help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

     To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:
  3. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  4. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  5. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  6. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  7. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

#### FAQ for Web Client Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1207:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. To attempt to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have valid logon credentials. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users. An attacker could also use this vulnerability to perform a local elevation of privilege attack.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the WebClient service.

**What is the Web Client service?**

The Web Client service allows applications to access documents on the Internet. Web Client extends the networking capability of Windows by allowing standard Win32 applications to create, read, and write files on Internet file servers by using the WebDAV protocol. The WebDAV protocol is a file-access protocol that is described in XML and that travels over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). By using standard HTTP, WebDAV runs over the existing Internet infrastructure. For example, WebDAV runs over firewalls and routers.

If the **Web Client** service is stopped, you will be prevented from using the Web Publishing Wizard to publish data to the Internet for locations that use the WebDAV protocol. If this service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on this service will not start. For more information on WebDAV, see the following [product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/server/iis/default.asp?url=/windows2000/en/server/iis/htm/core/wcwdcp.htm).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

To attempt to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have valid logon credentials. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users. Even though the Web Client service is used to support the WebDAV protocol over the Internet, an authenticated attacker must perform the steps that are required to attempt to exploit this issue. If the Guest account has been enabled on an affected system, then this attack could be performed by any user.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are several different ways that an attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would first have to authenticate to the system. An attacker could then try to exploit the vulnerability directly over a network by creating a series of specially crafted messages and sending them to an affected system. The messages could then cause the affected system to execute code.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could use another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component either locally or remotely.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk from this vulnerability. By default, the Internet Connection Firewall that is provided as part of Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 20003 blocks the affected ports from responding to network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability. By default, the Web Client service is disabled in Windows Server 2003.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT professionals can visit the [Security Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Web Client service validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyze, Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
