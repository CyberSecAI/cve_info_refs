- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in Drupal's privilege system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation due to a bypassed input check.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain additional user roles, potentially leading to administrative privileges, allowing them to take control of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation via public registration when enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to register a new account when public registration is enabled.
