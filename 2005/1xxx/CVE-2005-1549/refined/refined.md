Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `easymsgb.pl` script. Specifically, the `print` variable, which is used within an `open()` function, does not undergo proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to traverse directories by manipulating the `print` variable with sequences like `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, gaining access to sensitive files outside the intended web directory.
- **Remote Command Execution:** The lack of input validation permits the execution of arbitrary commands on the server through shell injection via the `print` variable (e.g., `print=|id|>`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to a full system compromise with the privileges of the web server user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP GET requests, embedding malicious commands and directory traversal sequences within the `print` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require any user authentication.
