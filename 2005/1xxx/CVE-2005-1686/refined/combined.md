gedit 2.10.2

no affected

all exploitable

1:why: gedit is power tool .. it used to edit *.c *.pl *.py ............

when it open a bin .. ths bin's name or filename is format strings ... it is exploitable

2:tips:

void

const gchar *uri,
const GeditEncoding *encoding,
GError *error,
GtkWindow *parent)
{
............

if (error_message == NULL)

error_message = g_strdup_printf (
_("Could not open the file \"%s\"."),
uri_for_display);................name
else
error_message = g_strdup_printf (
_("Could not open the file \"%s\".\n\n%s."),
uri_for_display, error->message);..........name

}

g_free (encoding_name);

Package        : gedit
Vulnerability  : format string
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-1686

A format string vulnerability has been discovered in gedit, a
light-weight text editor for GNOME, that may allow attackers to cause
a denial of service (application crash) via a binary file with format
string specifiers in the filename.  Since gedit supports opening files
via "<http://">; URLs (through GNOME vfs) and other schemes, this might
be a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not vulnerable to this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.3-4sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gedit package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
       will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
       will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
       will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
       will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

| [Description](#c0)  Adir Abraham    2005-05-20 11:28:55 UTC  ``` From SecurityFocus.com:  gEdit is prone to a format string vulnerability. Exploitation may occur when the program is invoked with a filename that includes malicious format specifiers. This issue could be exploited to corrupt arbitrary regions of memory with attacker-supplied data, potentially resulting in execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user running the program.   An example for an exploit:  bash-2.05b#cat fmtexp.c  #include <stdio.h>   int main() { printf("hah gedit\n"); }   bash-2.05b#gcc -o fk fmtexp.c  bash-2.05b#mv fk AA%n%n%n.c  bash-2.05b#gedit AA%n%n%n.c   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jean-François Brunette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-20 11:33:03 UTC  ``` vulnerable: GNOME gEdit 2.0.2 GNOME gEdit 2.2.0 GNOME gEdit 2.10.2 ------------------  There is the 2.10.2 in portage which is masked ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-20 14:18:16 UTC  ``` Pulling in gnome team. Is there something upstream ion this (very recent) issue ? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-24 05:43:24 UTC  ``` Just had a talk with Paolo Borelli on irc.gnome.org's #gedit. They know about it, but thought it was not public yet. I guess they will release a fix soon, once they fix an apparent mix-up with RedHat security. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-01 05:35:32 UTC  ``` Upstream is back from GUADEC and should post a new gedit soon.  Note that this requires a user to open a very strange-looking filename with gedit, and not sure it can easily be automated using email or web browsing. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-01 07:50:29 UTC  ``` evolution offers the possibility to open attachements with an appropriate application, so for text files that might be gedit. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-08 14:58:48 UTC  ``` added gedit-2.10.3 which according to the changelog has the fix for this, marked stable x86. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-09 09:34:37 UTC  ``` foser: many thx  I guess we should also backport the one-line patch to 2.8.x for the other arches because moving them to 2.10.x might not be an easy option ?  I'll try to isolate the patch, Paolo Borelli told me it should be quite simple to backport. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-09 10:26:56 UTC  ``` Hmm, not that simple. The patch is in 4 different files and the file names changed ffrom 2.8 to 2.10 apparently...  <http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/gedit/gedit/ChangeLog?r1=1.764&r2=1.765&sortby=date>  foser: what are our options ? I guess gedit-2.10 can't run on gnome 2.8 ? ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-10 01:40:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 60972](attachment.cgi?id=60972 "10_debian_format-string-vulnerabilities.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=60972&action=edit "10_debian_format-string-vulnerabilities.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=60972&action=diff "10_debian_format-string-vulnerabilities.patch")] 10_debian_format-string-vulnerabilities.patch  Patch from Ubuntu's release ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-10 01:41:41 UTC  ``` foser: the above patch applies cleanly to 2.8.3  To make it easier for other arches than x86, could you bump gedit-2.8.3 with that patch ? ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  foser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-10 07:27:56 UTC  ``` I didn't apply it to 2.8 because 2.10.3 doesn't need any of the 2.10 libs besides gtksourceview which is a safe upgrade as well. So my suggestion is to just have all arches update to 2.10.3 gedit, which is long overdue anyway.  But if you really want it in 2.8 anyway, just let me know. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-10 07:35:19 UTC  ``` Arches: please test and mark stable, see above comment.  ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Michael Hanselmann (hansmi) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-10 12:14:05 UTC  ``` Stable on ppc. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Simon Stelling (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-10 12:52:38 UTC  ``` stable on amd64 ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2005-06-10 23:35:51 UTC  ``` hppa/ia64 stable ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Markus Rothe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-11 03:25:03 UTC  ``` stable on ppc64  ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-11 03:35:05 UTC  ``` Alpha stable. ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-11 11:01:52 UTC  ``` GLSA 200506-09 mips: remember to mark stable to benefit from GLSA ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Hardave Riar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-07-02 13:45:21 UTC  ``` Stable on mips. ``` |  |
