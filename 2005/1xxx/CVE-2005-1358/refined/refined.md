The provided content describes vulnerabilities in the `text.cgi` script.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `text.cgi` script does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for command injection and arbitrary file access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Arbitrary file access:** The script allows an attacker to view system files by providing a path as an argument (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
2.  **Remote code execution:** The script allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting shell commands.
3.  **Cross-site scripting (CSS):** The script is also vulnerable to CSS by injecting Javascript into the parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Arbitrary file access:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information such as system configuration files or user data.
2.  **Remote code execution:** Attackers can gain full control of the server, install malware, or cause denial-of-service.
3.  **Cross-site scripting (CSS):** Attackers can steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions in the user's browser context.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited by crafting specific URLs that include malicious file paths or commands as parameters to the `text.cgi` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `text.cgi` script. The attacker can be remote.
