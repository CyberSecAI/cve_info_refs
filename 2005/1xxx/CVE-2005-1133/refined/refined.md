- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The POP3 service on AS/400 and iSeries servers provides detailed status messages during authentication, revealing information about user profiles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Information leakage through detailed status messages. The POP3 service discloses information on the existence and status of user profiles.
    - Lack of protection on the POP3 service. No security exit program is protecting the POP3 service from enumeration attempts.
    - Default enabled POP3 service.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - User enumeration: An attacker can identify valid user profiles on the system.
    - Social engineering attacks: The enumerated user list can be used for targeted social engineering attacks.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Authentication attempts to the POP3 service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to make network connections to the POP3 service on the AS/400 or iSeries server.
    - No valid user credential is required to begin user enumeration.
