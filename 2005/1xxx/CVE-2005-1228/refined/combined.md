Subject: gzip: dir traversal bug when using "gunzip -N"
Package: gzip
Version: 1.3.5-9
Severity: important
Tags: security patch

A directory traversal bug exists in multiple versions of gzip. When
compressing a file, gzip saves its original name but not its path inside
the compressed file. When using gunzip's "-N" option, the original name
found inside the compressed file will be used as the name to save the
decompressed file with. "gunzip -N" doesn't check if the original name inside
the compressed file has any "/" characters in it. This makes it possible to
create a malicious compressed file that when decompressed with "gunzip -N"
will create a file at an arbitrary location in the file system, such as
"/etc/nologin" or "/etc/cron.d/evil".

The command "gunzip -N" prints no output during normal operation, so the
user will not get any warning! The command "gunzip -Nv" prints information
about what file it is creating where, but then it may be too late.

The gunzip command always asks before overwriting existing files, so this
bug only allows for creating new files and not overwriting old ones.

This bug has some limited security implications. It allows attackers to create
arbitrary files with arbitrary contents on a system, if they can get a user or
a program with sufficient rights to decompress a .gz file from the attackers
with "gunzip -N".

At least the following gzip versions are affected: 1.2.4, 1.2.4a, 1.3.3,
1.3.4 and 1.3.5.

I have attached the compressed file "dir-traversal-bug.gz" that will create
a file in "/tmp" when decompressed with "gunzip -N". I have also attached a
patch.

with this patch: `gzip -9nf /tmp/something` stores output

(our macros compress manpages in $tmpinstalldir in this way).

without this patch: `gzip -9nf /tmp/something` stores output

Hello,

here is a better patch. It removes the directory part of the
filename when it is read from the .gz file, and not when opening
it, so the earlier side effects should disappear now.

The patch applies, but do not compile with gzip 1.2.4a.  base_name()
is an unknown function in that source.  Can basename() be used
instead?  The code seem to indicate this.  This patch compiles, but I
am not sure if it is correct, yet.

retitle 305255 CAN-2005-1228 gzip: dir traversal bug when using "gunzip -N"
thanks

Time to tag the CVE number into the title. :)

This bug is reported into RedHat as bug
<URL:<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=156266>>.
There is no patch available there.  It is also reported as solved by
Ubuntu, <URL:<http://lwn.net/Alerts/134678/>>.  They are using the patch
directly from  Ulf Harnhammar.

Based on the patch from Ulf Harnhammar, I ended up with this patch for
version 1.2.4a.  The original patch was not legal ANSI C89, and failed
to build with gcc 2.95.  I'm still not sure if the user of basename()
instead of base_name() is the correct thing to do here.

It's the same function, so it should be correct.

More details about the issues fixed may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0758   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0988   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1228   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4334   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4335   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4336   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4337   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4338   Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/gzip-1.3.5-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz:   Upgraded to gzip-1.3.5, and fixed a variety of bugs.   Some of the bugs have possible security implications if gzip or its tools are   fed a carefully constructed malicious archive.  Most of these issues were   recently discovered by Tavis Ormandy and the Google Security Team.  Thanks   to them, and also to the ALT and Owl developers for cleaning up the patch.   For further details about the issues fixed, please see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0758     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0988     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1228     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4334     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4335     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4336     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4337     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4338   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com? Give slackware.osuosl.org a try.  This is another primary FTP site for Slackware that can be considerably faster than downloading from ftp.slackware.com.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=156266#c0)  Josh Bressers    2005-04-28 15:33:53 UTC  ``` A directory traversal bug exists in multiple versions of gzip. When compressing a file, gzip saves its original name but not its path inside the compressed file. When using gunzip's "-N" option, the original name found inside the compressed file will be used as the name to save the decompressed file with. "gunzip -N" doesn't check if the original name inside the compressed file has any "/" characters in it. This makes it possible to create a malicious compressed file that when decompressed with "gunzip -N" will create a file at an arbitrary location in the file system.  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=305255>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=156266#c1)  Josh Bressers    2005-04-28 15:42:30 UTC  ``` This issue should also affect RHEL2.1 and RHEL3   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=156266#c2)  Ivana Varekova    2005-05-03 09:47:30 UTC  ``` The new versions (gzip-1.3.3-11.rhel3, gzip-1.3.3-15.rhel4, gzip-1.3-17.rhel2) released. Ivana Varekova   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=156266#c3)  Josh Bressers    2005-06-13 12:12:58 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.

Package        : gzip
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0988 CAN-2005-1228
Debian Bug     : 305255

Two problems have been discovered in gzip, the GNU compression
utility.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems.

CAN-2005-0988

    Imran Ghory discovered a race condition in the permissions setting
    code in gzip.  When decompressing a file in a directory an
    attacker has access to, gunzip could be tricked to set the file
    permissions to a different file the user has permissions to.

CAN-2005-1228

    Ulf Härnhammar discovered a path traversal vulnerability in
    gunzip.  When gunzip is used with the -N option an attacker could
    this vulnerability to create files in an arbitrary directory with
    the permissions of the user.

For the oldstable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.2-3woody5.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.5-10.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.5-10.

We recommend that you upgrade your gzip package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2005:357 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

gzip security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2005%3A357)

## Topic

An updated gzip package is now available.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

The gzip package contains the GNU gzip data compression program.

A bug was found in the way zgrep processes file names. If a user can be
tricked into running zgrep on a file with a carefully crafted file name,
arbitrary commands could be executed as the user running zgrep. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2005-0758 to this issue.

A bug was found in the way gunzip modifies permissions of files being
decompressed. A local attacker with write permissions in the directory in
which a victim is decompressing a file could remove the file being written
and replace it with a hard link to a different file owned by the victim.
gunzip then gives the linked file the permissions of the uncompressed file.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2005-0988 to this issue.

A directory traversal bug was found in the way gunzip processes the -N
flag. If a victim decompresses a file with the -N flag, gunzip fails to
sanitize the path which could result in a file owned by the victim being
overwritten. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1228 to this issue.

Users of gzip should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains
the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
