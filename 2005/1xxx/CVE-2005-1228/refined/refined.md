This could lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker creates configuration or init files with malicious content.",

The attacker does not need to have any local access, beyond being able to provide a file to the victim. The user or program that decompresses the file needs to have sufficient rights to create the file in the target location."

Specific capabilities needed depend on the context of use, but typically would involve social engineering or exploiting an already vulnerable service."
