Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An unspecified flaw exists within a certain range of serial numbers of Sun StorEdge 6130 controller arrays.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the presence of an undisclosed vulnerability within the controller arrays. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote access, which shouldn't be possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain unauthorized access to the array.
- Once access is gained, the attacker can delete arbitrary data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker doesn't need physical access to the device.
- It's an unauthenticated attack, indicating that the attacker doesn't require any login credentials or prior access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to remotely access the vulnerable Sun StorEdge 6130 array.
- No prior authentication or specialized capabilities are needed other than being able to connect remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific vulnerable arrays are limited to those with serial numbers in the range of 0451AWF00G - 0513AWF00J.
- The CERT advisory links to SunSolve document 57771 for additional details and remediation, noting that a utility is needed to resolve this issue, obtainable by contacting a Sun service provider.
- Secunia advisory 15306 is also linked as a reference.

It is important to note that the specific nature of the flaw within the controller array is not described, only the impact of a successful exploit.
