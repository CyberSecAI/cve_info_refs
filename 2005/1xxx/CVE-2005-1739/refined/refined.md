      "content_source": "bugs.gentoo.org_46b425c3_20250126_023556.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is in the XWD (X Window Dump) decoder within ImageMagick. The color mask can be set to zero, leading to an infinite loop.",

        "Infinite loop",
        "Denial of service"

        "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote; a specially crafted XWD image can be submitted to ImageMagick for processing, triggering the infinite loop.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs the capability to send a malicious XWD image to a system utilizing a vulnerable version of ImageMagick."
