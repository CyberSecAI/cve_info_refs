```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in PHP-Nuke 7.6 and below when handling the 'forwarder' parameter in the 'modules.php' script. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or escape user-provided data before using it in HTTP headers.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The primary vulnerability is HTTP response splitting. This occurs when an attacker injects carriage return and line feed characters (%0d%0a) into an HTTP header, enabling the attacker to control subsequent headers and the response body.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for several malicious activities:
  - Cross-user defacement: Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML to modify the content viewed by other users.
  - Cache poisoning: By manipulating the HTTP response, attackers can poison web caches, causing them to serve the malicious content to other users.
  - Page hijacking: Attackers can redirect users to a completely different site or page.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a crafted URL targeting the 'modules.php' script and including malicious characters in the 'forwarder' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP-Nuke server and craft URLs with specific malicious input. No special access or position is required besides network connectivity to the target server.
