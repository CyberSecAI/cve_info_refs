**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Nag version 1.1.2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The content explicitly mentions "an XSS vulnerability" being fixed in version 1.1.3. This indicates that the previous version, 1.1.2, was vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into a vulnerable input field that will be displayed or processed by the web application. This can sometimes be achieved through social engineering or by exploiting other vulnerabilities. The attacker would need access to the web interface of the Nag application.
