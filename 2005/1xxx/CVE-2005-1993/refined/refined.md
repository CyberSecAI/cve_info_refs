  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in Sudo's command pathname handling prior to version 1.6.8p9. Specifically, when a user runs a command via Sudo, the inode and device numbers of the command are compared to those of commands with the same basename found in the `sudoers` file. If a `sudoers` entry containing the pseudo-command `ALL` follows the user's `sudoers` entry, the `safe_cmnd` variable (which stores the path to the command) is overwritten with the path the user specified on the command line.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition in command pathname validation",
      "Improper handling of `ALL` pseudo-command in `sudoers` file"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with Sudo privileges can exploit the race condition by creating a symbolic link that points to a malicious executable. This allows the user to run arbitrary commands as a privileged user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Symbolic link manipulation",
      "Command-line execution"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have Sudo privileges to run one or more commands and be able to create symbolic links in the filesystem. Also, there must be a `sudoers` entry that gives another user access to the `ALL` pseudo-command, and this entry must follow the userâ€™s entry for the race to exist.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because the `safe_cmnd` variable is overwritten with the user-supplied command path when an `ALL` sudoers entry is found after a user's specific command entry. The expected behavior is that the `safe_cmnd` value from the matching `sudoers` entry is used."
