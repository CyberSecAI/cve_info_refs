  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Website field of a user's profile in MyBB 1.0 RC4 does not properly sanitize user input before inserting the data into the database.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject HTML and scripting code into a user's profile, potentially leading to:\n  - Altering website display.\n  - Stealing cookies containing password hashes.\n  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.\n  - Performing other malicious tasks within the context of the user's session.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker manipulates the 'Website' field within a user's profile, injecting malicious code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the 'Website' field of a user profile. This could be done through a compromised user account or by exploiting another vulnerability that allows profile modification."
