Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1392:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The phpMyAdmin installation process installed the SQL script used to set up the database with world-readable permissions. This script contained the initial password for the `pma` user in the MySQL database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure file permissions: The SQL script containing the `pma` user's password was installed with world-readable permissions (644 instead of 600), allowing any local user to read it.
- Hardcoded initial password: The SQL script contained the plain-text password, which was the same across all installations if not changed after the initial setup.
- Ineffective upgrade procedure: Upgrading phpMyAdmin did not change the `pma` user password, meaning the initial password remained valid even after upgrades, if not manually changed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local privilege escalation: Any user with shell access to the system could read the SQL script, obtain the initial `pma` password, and log in to phpMyAdmin.
- Database compromise: Once logged in, an attacker could modify the phpMyAdmin database (`PMA_*` tables), potentially leading to further compromise of databases accessible by phpMyAdmin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker must have local shell access to the system where phpMyAdmin is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Shell access: An attacker must have a user account with shell access on the server where phpMyAdmin is installed.
- File system access: The attacker must be able to navigate to the directory containing the vulnerable SQL script.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was addressed by changing the permissions of the SQL script to be readable only by the root user, ensuring the password was not world-readable.
- The bug report mentions that the `config.inc.php` file also had insecure permissions which could expose the password. This was addressed later.
- A Gentoo Linux Security Advisory (GLSA 200504-30) was released to notify users of the vulnerability, recommending a password change and upgrade.
- The vulnerability primarily affects initial installs, not upgrades (unless a manual `pma` user password change occurred.)
- A new `webapp-config` was released to properly handle permissions on config files, including phpMyAdmin's `config.inc.php`.
