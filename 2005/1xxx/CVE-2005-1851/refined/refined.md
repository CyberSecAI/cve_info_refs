**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a shell command injection flaw present in a user-contributed script within the ekg package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Shell command injection: The user-contributed script improperly handles input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a user-contributed script within the ekg package. The specific way to trigger the vulnerability is not specified in this advisory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path within the user-contributed script to inject malicious shell commands. This suggests that user interaction or some kind of triggering event related to the script is necessary, and is not network facing.

**Additional Notes:**
