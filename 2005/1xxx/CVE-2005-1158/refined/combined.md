How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Attached patch

[add security check, block javascript: URLs completely (matching IE)](attachment.cgi?id=180532&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=180532&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=290079&attachment=180532)

This is a double-layered fix:
Add the obvious missing security check.
Block javascript: URLs entirely if they target \_search. This is matching
behaviour to IE, and since this is an IE-ism, I feel completely safe in taking
this step.
I will file a followup bug tonight or tomorrow about looking over our web
panels code and better bulletproofing this against future silliness.

Note that the webSecurityCheck() prevents the opening of chrome, but even
without chrome privs you could load some target site in the sidebar and then
inject script using data: to steal cookies or whatever else might be there.
The testcase is polite about waiting for us to click two links in succession, a
real exploit would simply attack.

I'm testing 2005-04-13-00-aviary1.0.1.
"Click Here First" - JavaScript console says "Security Error: Content at
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=180506> may not load or link to
about:plugins."
"Next, Click Here" - nothing happens.
data: testcase produced the same results. Looks good.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-39

## Arbitrary code execution from Firefox sidebar panel II

Announced
April 15, 2005
Reporter
Kohei Yoshino
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.3

### Description

Sites can use the \_search target to open links in the Firefox sidebar. Two
missing security checks allow malicious scripts to first open a privileged
page (such as about:config) and then inject script using a javascript: url.
This could be used to install malicious code or steal data without user interaction.

### Workaround

Disable Javascript
