Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-1158

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from missing security checks when using the `_search` target to open links in the Firefox sidebar. This allows malicious scripts to bypass security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Security Checks:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation when handling links opened in the sidebar with the `_search` target.
- **JavaScript URL Handling:** The browser fails to adequately sanitize or block `javascript:` URLs when used with the `_search` target, which allows for arbitrary code execution.
- **Data URI Handling:**  The vulnerability also extends to `data:` URIs, where scripts could be injected to perform malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser, potentially leading to system compromise.
- **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could be injected to steal user data (cookies, etc.) without user interaction.
- **Privileged Page Access:** Attackers could gain access to privileged browser pages like `about:config` through the sidebar, leading to further manipulation of the browser.
- **Malware Installation:** Attackers could install malicious code through this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Sidebar Links:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted links that are opened in the Firefox sidebar using `target="_search"`.
- **javascript: URLs:** The use of `javascript:` URLs is a core component of the attack, allowing for immediate code execution.
- **data: URLs:** Similarly, the vulnerability can be exploited using `data:` URLs that inject script content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to create or control web content that includes the malicious links to be opened in the sidebar.
- **User Interaction:** While some user interaction is required (clicking the malicious link), the subsequent execution of the malicious code can happen without further user consent.

**Additional Details:**

- The bug report mentions that the vulnerability was Firefox-specific and did not affect the Mozilla Suite in the same way.
- The fix involved adding a security check and completely blocking javascript: URLs when they target `_search`, matching Internet Explorer's behavior.
- A subsequent patch also addresses the `data:` URI vulnerability
- The bug was initially reported by Kohei Yoshino
- The vulnerability is considered critical and was fixed in Firefox 1.0.3
