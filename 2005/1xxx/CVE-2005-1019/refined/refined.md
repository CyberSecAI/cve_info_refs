{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses strcpy() to copy the value of the HOME environment variable into a local buffer of 512 bytes within the getConfig() function without checking the length of the environment variable. If the HOME environment variable is larger than 512 bytes, a buffer overflow occurs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow vulnerability due to using strcpy() with an unchecked input size."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially gain elevated privileges by exploiting this buffer overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation by manipulating the HOME environment variable.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the application locally and control the HOME environment variable."
