{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Fine-grained auditing (FGA) is disabled for all users if the SYS user executes a SELECT statement on an FGA-protected object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that when the SYS user queries a table protected by FGA, it disables auditing for subsequent queries, even those from other users. Additionally, the SELECT statement executed by SYS is not audited.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact is that auditing of database activity is disabled, making it difficult to track potentially malicious actions. If the SYS user queries a FGA protected table, no further auditing will occur on that object until the shared pool is flushed or the database is restarted. This can lead to a situation where unauthorized access or activities go undetected.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is simply executing a SELECT statement on an FGA object as the SYS user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have SYS privileges or be able to execute code as the SYS user to exploit the vulnerability."
