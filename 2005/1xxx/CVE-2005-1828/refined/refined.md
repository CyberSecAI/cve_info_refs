Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities in the D-Link DSL-504T router:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper access control on certain CGI scripts and the storage of sensitive information in clear text. The web interface does not properly restrict access to the `/cgi-bin/firmwarecfg` page, allowing unauthenticated users to perform actions such as firmware upgrades and configuration downloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unprotected Firmware Upgrade:** The `/cgi-bin/firmwarecfg` page allows remote, unauthenticated users to upgrade the router's firmware.
2.  **Unprotected Configuration Download:** The same page allows remote, unauthenticated users to download the router's configuration file.
3.  **Cleartext Storage of Credentials:** The downloaded configuration file contains the router's management username and password in cleartext within an XML structure.
4.  **Cleartext Storage of ADSL Credentials:** The configuration file also contains the ADSL connection username and password in cleartext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Router Control:** Attackers can gain complete control of the router by changing the firmware, downloading the configuration file, obtaining the administrative username/password, and using it to log in via Telnet for a shell.
*   **Compromised Network:** By gaining control of the router, an attacker could potentially redirect network traffic, conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, or use the router as a botnet node.
*   **Compromised User Accounts:** Attackers can steal ADSL credentials which could potentially lead to email/web account compromises if the same credentials are used elsewhere.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote access via HTTP. An attacker can exploit these issues by directly accessing the router's web management interface via its IP address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to reach the router's web management interface over the network. This typically means the router must be directly exposed to the internet or the attacker has access to the local network.
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit the firmware and configuration download vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

* The issue was tested on firmware version V1.00B01T16.EU.20040217
* The content suggests similar vulnerabilities may be present in other routers that use busybox and are configurable via HTTP or thttp.
* Vendor not contacted at time of the report.
