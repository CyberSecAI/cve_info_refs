The provided content discloses multiple vulnerabilities in Ultimate PHP Board (UPB) versions 1.8 to 1.9.6, including HTML injection, SQL injection, and full path disclosure.

**HTML Injection**
*   **Root cause:** The `postorder` parameter in `viewforum.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*   **Vulnerability:** Improper input sanitization.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript, potentially leading to cookie theft or other client-side attacks (XSS).
*   **Attack vector:**  By crafting a malicious URL with injected HTML/JavaScript in the `postorder` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:**  Remote attacker; no special privileges required.

**SQL Injection**
*   **Root cause:**  The `postorder` parameter is not correctly handled in SQL queries or data access, allowing an attacker to manipulate the queries. The vulnerability exists in `textdb.inc.php`.
*  **Vulnerability:** SQL injection through the `postorder` parameter and potentially other parts of the `textdb.inc.php` script
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can inject malicious SQL statements, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying database entries or other database related actions.
*  **Attack vector:** By injecting specific SQL commands through the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Attacker capabilities:**  Remote attacker; no special privileges required.

**Full Path Disclosure**
*   **Root cause:** The application displays the full server path in error messages when invalid input is provided to `viewforum.php`.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Information disclosure.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can gain information about the server's file system structure, which may help in planning further attacks.
*   **Attack vector:**  By sending requests to `viewforum.php` with a very large or invalid ID parameter (`id=123456789123456789`) and a defined `postorder` value.
*  **Attacker capabilities:**  Remote attacker; no special privileges required.
