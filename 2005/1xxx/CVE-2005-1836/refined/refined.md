Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2005-1836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in multiple security flaws within the NEXTWEB (i)Site website management system. Specifically, these include:
*   **SQL injection vulnerabilities:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied inputs allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries.
*   **Unsafe directory configurations:** Databases are stored within the webroot, allowing for direct access.
*   **Lack of input validation and exception handling:** The system fails to validate user inputs and properly handle exceptional conditions, leading to errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  The `login.asp` page is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Insecure Storage of Database:** The `Users.mdb` database is located in a publicly accessible directory (`/databases/`).
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to properly validate user inputs leading to errors
*   **Improper Exception Handling:** The system fails to handle exceptional conditions, leading to application crashes (Error 500).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the login mechanism using SQL injection, gaining administrative access to the (i)Site management system.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:**  Attackers can download the `Users.mdb` database, gaining access to administrator usernames and passwords.
*   **Denial of Service:** By providing crafted input, attackers can cause an error 500, potentially denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:**  Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities through the web interface of the (i)Site application.
*   **Direct URL manipulation:** Attackers can directly craft URL requests to exploit vulnerable scripts and file paths.
*   **SQL Injection:** Specifically crafted username and password to manipulate the SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** Knowledge of web requests and understanding SQL queries would be required to execute attacks effectively.
*   **No authentication:** No prior authentication is necessary to perform the attacks.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vendor was contacted but did not respond to vulnerability reports.
*   The vulnerabilities are present in all versions of the (i)Site management system.
