Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially leading to unauthorized access to or modification of the database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-supplied input without proper encoding or sanitization within the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which executes in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Unsanitized input in `addToCart.asp?idProduct`, `productDetails.asp?idProduct`, `searchResults.asp?priceFrom`, `searchResults.asp?priceTo`, `searchResults.asp?idCategory`, and `searchResults.asp?sku` parameters.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Unsanitized input in `tellAFriend.asp?idProduct`, `addToWishlist.asp?idProduct`, `access.asp?redirect`, `error.asp?message`, `login.asp?message`, `searchResults.asp?name`, `productCatalogSubCats.asp?idParentCategory`, and `login.asp?redirect` parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Database compromise (data theft, data manipulation, etc.)
    *   Potential for privilege escalation within the application.
    *   Application unavailability due to database errors or crashes.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies and other session data)
    *   User redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Potentially spreading malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   HTTP GET request manipulation via vulnerable parameters.
*   **XSS:**
    *   HTTP GET request manipulation via vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker can be an unauthenticated remote user.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send manipulated HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided examples use `'` and `"` to demonstrate injection attempts. It's highly likely that more complex attacks are possible.
* The error messages shown provide some details on the underlying database and query structure which can help an attacker craft a targeted exploit.
* The report shows multiple instances of both SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities across different pages and parameters.
