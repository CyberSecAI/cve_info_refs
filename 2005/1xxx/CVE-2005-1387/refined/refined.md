- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application "Cocktail" uses an insecure method to execute command-line utilities requiring administrative privileges. It pipes the admin password to `sudo` via `echo` and `/bin/sh`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the admin password in a command-line process. By using `echo 'PASSWORD' | sudo ...`, the password becomes visible in the process arguments.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who can view the process list (e.g. using `ps ax`) can discover the admin password.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs local access to the system where Cocktail is running and must be able to execute commands to view processes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute commands such as `ps ax` on the system where Cocktail is being used, while the application is running a process that requires the admin password.
