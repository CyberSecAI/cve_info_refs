```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The cpio utility failed to properly sanitize file paths extracted from archives, specifically regarding the ".." path component, even when the `--no-absolute-filenames` option was used.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Path traversal vulnerability, allowing files to be written to arbitrary locations.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could craft a malicious cpio archive that, when extracted by a user, would install files to arbitrary paths on the system, with the privileges of the user extracting the archive. This could overwrite critical system files or introduce malicious executables. When combined with the race condition vulnerability described in CVE-2005-1111, could lead to privilege escalation.
  - Attack vectors: A local user could trick another user into extracting a specially crafted cpio archive.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to create a malicious cpio archive and convince a target user to extract it. The attacker must have the ability to get the target user to run the crafted archive.
