Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.
*   It stems from the improper handling of the `newsid` parameter within the `news.php` script of FlexPHPNews 0.0.5. Specifically, user-supplied input is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the direct injection of unsanitized user input into a SQL query. The code constructs the SQL query like this: `select * from news where newsid='$newsid'`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and potentially:
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords (as demonstrated in the provided exploit), and other potentially confidential information.
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain control over the application or the underlying server.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: By injecting SQL commands, an attacker can potentially access administrator credentials stored in the database which might lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is the `newsid` parameter in the URL when accessing `news.php`. The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query within the `newsid` parameter. For example: `http://[Taget]/[Path]/news.php?newsid=999+union+select+0,username,password+from+newsadmin`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web application and send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL to craft a malicious query that will extract or manipulate data.
*   **No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.**

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit was initially discovered and reported in 2005, but it was rediscovered and re-reported in 2007, indicating that some systems may still be vulnerable.
* The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract username and password information from the `newsadmin` table. This is a standard technique for exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
