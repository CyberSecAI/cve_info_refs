Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2005-1981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the way domain controllers process specially crafted Kerberos messages. The Kerberos implementation in the affected products is vulnerable to a flaw in handling messages from remote authenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of Kerberos messages by domain controllers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: An attacker can cause the domain controller authentication service to stop responding.
- System Restart: In some cases, the attack may force the domain controller to automatically restart, interrupting authentication services.
- Temporary Loss of Authentication: During the restart countdown and after the restart, users may not be able to perform domain authentication, potentially affecting access to domain resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: An attacker sends specially crafted Kerberos messages to a vulnerable domain controller.
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs valid logon credentials to exploit the vulnerability. Anonymous users cannot exploit this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid Domain Credentials: The attacker must have valid user credentials in the target domain.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target domain controller, either from within the network or potentially from the Internet if firewall rules allow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability primarily affects Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.
- Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP are not affected by this vulnerability.
- While a firewall can mitigate external attacks, an attacker with valid credentials within the network can still exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed when the security bulletin was released.
- There were no reports of exploitation when the security bulletin was released.
- The update modifies how Kerberos processes the specially crafted message to remove the vulnerability.
