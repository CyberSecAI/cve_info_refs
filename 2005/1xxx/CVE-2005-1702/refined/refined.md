    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-1702",
      "details": "The game Warrior Kings: Battles (<= 1.23) and Warrior Kings (<= 1.3) are vulnerable to a format string bug in the function used to display text. This vulnerability can be exploited by using a malformed nickname. The server must not be locked for successful exploitation. A separate crash vulnerability exists in Warrior Kings Battles, caused by a partial join packet resulting in a NULL pointer access. The crash vulnerability is specific to the Battles version of the game.",
      "root_cause": "Format string vulnerability due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the text display function, and a null pointer dereference due to a partial join packet.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Format string vulnerability",
        "NULL pointer dereference"
      ],
      "impact": "The format string vulnerability can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. The NULL pointer dereference causes the server to crash.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation via malformed nickname (format string)",
        "Remote exploitation via partial join packet (crash)"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to join the game server, and the server must not be locked. For the format string vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to set a malformed nickname. For the crash vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to send a partial join packet."
