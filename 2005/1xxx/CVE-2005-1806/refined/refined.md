Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-1806

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a format string error within the Peercast software. Specifically, when the Peercast server receives a malformed HTTP request, the error handling routine incorrectly uses a `printf` style function to print the malformed URL. This allows the injected format string to be parsed as instructions and potentially overwrite memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the format string vulnerability in the error handling routine of the Peercast server. By providing specially crafted format specifiers within the URL, attackers can cause the server to crash or execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the user running Peercast. Usually, this is the administrator.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even without arbitrary code execution, the vulnerability can lead to a server crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTTP Request:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing format string specifiers within the URL to the Peercast server. For example, `http://localhost:7144/html/en/index.htm%n`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Peercast server. This attack can be performed remotely if the server is exposed to the internet or a network that the attacker is connected to.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of constructing HTTP requests with malicious URLs containing format string specifiers.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects Peercast versions 0.1211 and earlier.
- The issue was fixed in version 0.1212, which is the recommended version for users to upgrade.
- The advisory was released by the GulfTech Security Research Team and the fix was quickly provided by the Peercast developers.
- Gentoo Linux issued a security advisory (GLSA 200506-15) to inform users about the vulnerability and recommend updating their Peercast package.
