      "vulnerability": "Nickname Buffer Overflow",
      "description": "A buffer overflow exists in the nickname field (ID 0x1e), allowing an attacker to potentially execute malicious code.",

      "vulnerability": "Data Block Buffer Overflow",
      "description": "The buffer used to receive data from the socket is 256 bytes, while the maximum size of the data block can be 65536 bytes. This discrepancy causes a buffer overflow.",

      "vulnerability": "Freeze Caused by Incomplete Data Block",
      "description": "Sending incomplete data blocks can freeze the server and connected clients. The game is synchronized with network data reception and blocks until all expected data is received. Sending less than the expected header size (e.g., 9 bytes instead of 10) can trigger this.",
