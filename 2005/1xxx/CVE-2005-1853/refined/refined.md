```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The gopher client creates temporary files in an insecure manner.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure temporary file creation.
- Impact of exploitation: The advisory states it's a local problem, suggesting that a local attacker could potentially exploit the insecure temporary file creation, potentially leading to unauthorized file access or modification by manipulating the temporary files.
- Attack vectors: Local attacker.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable gopher client is running.
