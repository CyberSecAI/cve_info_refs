```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The application lacks access control on the admin folder, allowing unauthorized access to administrative functions. Additionally, the `writeinfo.php` script directly writes user-supplied data from POST requests into the `info.php` file without proper sanitization or validation, leading to code injection.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
1.  Missing access control: The admin folder is accessible without authentication.
2.  Code injection: The `writeinfo.php` script is vulnerable to code injection via the `$_POST['url']` variable.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can gain administrative access by accessing the admin folder without any authentication. Furthermore, by exploiting the code injection vulnerability, an attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into the `info.php` file, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing for complete control of the blog and potentially the server hosting it.

Attack vectors:
1. Direct access to the admin folder via a web browser.
2. Sending a crafted POST request to the `writeinfo.php` script containing malicious PHP code in the `url` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server. No other specific capabilities are required, assuming that the server is accessible via the internet.
