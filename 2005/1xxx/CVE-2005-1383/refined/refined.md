Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-1383

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Oracle Web Cache does not properly enforce access restrictions defined for the Oracle HTTP Server (OHS). This allows requests to bypass the intended security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The vulnerability lies in the web cache's failure to respect the access control configurations set on the OHS.
- **Bypass of mod_access restrictions:** The mod_access module in the OHS is bypassed when requests are routed through the Web Cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to protected URLs and resources that they would normally be denied access to when accessing the OHS directly.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  Accessing URLs like `/dmsoc4j/AggreSpy`, `/server-status`, and `/dms0`  through the web cache exposes potentially sensitive system information that should be protected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by sending requests through the webcache.
- **Webcache as a Proxy:** The attacker sends requests to the web cache, which then forwards them to the OHS while bypassing access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the webcache.
- **Knowledge of Protected URLs:** The attacker needs knowledge of the protected URLs on the OHS, which can be common configuration paths.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was resolved by introducing a parameter "UseWebcacheIP" to the Oracle HTTP Server (OHS).
- The fix was never officially disclosed in a security alert.
- The default configuration of OHS does not include this parameter set to on, making it vulnerable unless manually configured.
- The provided test cases show that specific URLs which are protected when accessed via the OHS server directly on port 7779, are not protected when accessed via the Webcache on port 7778.
- The vulnerability affects Oracle Application Server OHS versions 1.0.2 through 10.x.
