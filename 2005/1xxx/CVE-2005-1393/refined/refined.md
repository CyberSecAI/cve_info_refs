Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in multiple vulnerabilities within the UNIX versions of ESRI ArcGIS products, specifically ArcInfo Workstation 9.0. These include:
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities:** Present in `lockmgr` and `wservice` binaries.
    *   **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities:** Found in `asmaster`, `asuser`, `asutility`, `se`, and `asrecovery` binaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Bugs:** The `lockmgr` and `wservice` executables are vulnerable to format string attacks. This occurs because they process an environment variable (`ARCHOME`) in a manner where user-controlled data is directly used as part of a format string, which can be used to read from and write to arbitrary memory locations.
*   **Buffer Overflows:** Multiple binaries (`asmaster`, `asuser`, `asutility`, `se`, and `asrecovery`) are vulnerable to buffer overflows. This means they don't properly validate the size of user input, allowing an attacker to write data past the intended buffer limits. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, including return addresses, potentially hijacking program execution.
*   **Setuid/Setgid Binaries:** The vulnerable executables are setuid root and setgid, meaning they run with elevated privileges of the root user, or the group `nuucp` or `lp` respectively on SunOS and IRIX.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the format string and buffer overflow vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the binary. Since the binaries are setuid/setgid, this means a local attacker can gain root privileges or group access on the system, depending on the group.
*   **Denial of Service:** Overflows can cause the application to crash.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The setuid nature of these binaries allows a local attacker to gain root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited by local users on the system.
*   **Format String:** Providing a crafted string via the `ARCHOME` environment variable triggers the format string vulnerability.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Sending overly long arguments to the vulnerable binaries triggers buffer overflows.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local user access to the system to be able to execute the vulnerable binaries.
*   **Ability to Set Environment Variables and Pass Arguments:** The attacker needs to be able to set environment variables such as `ARCHOME` and pass command-line arguments to the vulnerable binaries.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory includes proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code for the format string vulnerability in `wservice`.
*   ESRI released a patch to address these vulnerabilities, which replaced the vulnerable binaries.
*   The provided exploit overwrites the `thr_jmp_table` in memory to achieve code execution.
*   The vulnerability is present in `ArcInfo Workstation 9.0` on UNIX platforms, potentially impacting earlier versions as well.
*   The vulnerable binaries are located in the `<install path>/bin` directory.
