Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-1071

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `$haslo` variable is directly included in the SQL query without being escaped or sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `$haslo` variable, which is then executed by the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database such as user credentials (login and md5 hash password) and other sensitive data from the `admins` table.
- **Data Manipulation:** It's possible that further injection may allow data manipulation such as modification or deletion.
- **Bypass Authentication:** By extracting administrator credentials, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application.
- **Data Exposure**: An attacker can see statistics of banners they don't have permissions for.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `banner.php` script, specifically the `title` parameter, which corresponds to the `$haslo` variable. The attacker can manipulate the `$haslo` parameter in the URL to inject malicious SQL code.
- The vulnerable code is located in `module/banner.inc.php` at line 192.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `banner.php` page of the jPortal application.
- The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax and understand the structure of the database to formulate effective SQL injection attacks.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
  ```php
  $query = "SELECT * FROM $bann_a_tbl WHERE title='$haslo' ORDER BY id DESC";
  ```
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve sensitive information from the `admins` table.
- Another PoC shows that the attacker can inject code using `or id='x'` to view statistics for banners not belonging to him.

**Mitigation:**
- The recommended fix is to sanitize the `$haslo` variable using `addslashes($haslo)` before including it in the SQL query:
  ```php
  $haslo = addslashes($haslo);
  $query = "SELECT * FROM $bann_a_tbl WHERE title='$haslo' ORDER BY id DESC";
  ```
