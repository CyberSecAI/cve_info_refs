Root cause of vulnerability:
Two distinct security issues were identified:
1.  **Character Conversion Vulnerability:** The functions responsible for client-to-server character set conversions are accessible to unprivileged users via SQL commands. These functions are not designed to handle malicious argument values, which could lead to a crash or privilege escalation.
2.  **tsearch2 Vulnerability:** The tsearch2 module incorrectly declares several functions as returning the 'internal' type, when they do not have an 'internal' argument. This flaw bypasses the type safety of 'internal' and allows attackers to use these functions to call other functions that accept internal arguments which can lead to crashing the backend.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
1.  Unprivileged users could invoke character conversion functions with crafted input, leading to crashes or potentially privilege escalation.
2.  The tsearch2 module's incorrect type declarations for functions could be exploited by malicious SQL commands to call internal functions, leading to crashes.

Impact of exploitation:
1.  An unprivileged database user can crash the backend process
2.  An unprivileged user might be able to gain the privileges of a database superuser.

Attack vectors:
1.  Malicious SQL commands by unprivileged users calling vulnerable character set conversion functions.
2.  Malicious SQL commands by unprivileged users calling tsearch2 functions.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
1.  Ability to execute SQL commands within a PostgreSQL database as an unprivileged user.
2.  For tsearch2, the module must be installed in the target database.
