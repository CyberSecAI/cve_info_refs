# Qpopper: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200505-17**

Qpopper contains two vulnerabilities allowing an attacker to overwrite
arbitrary files and create files with insecure permissions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/qpopper** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.5-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.5-r3** |

### Background

Qpopper is a widely used server for the POP3 protocol.

### Description

Jens Steube discovered that Qpopper doesn't drop privileges to
process local files from normal users (CAN-2005-1151). The upstream
developers discovered that Qpopper can be forced to create group or
world writeable files (CAN-2005-1152).

### Impact

A malicious local attacker could exploit Qpopper to overwrite
arbitrary files as root or create new files which are group or world
writeable.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Qpopper users should upgrade to the latest available version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/qpopper-4.0.5-r3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : qpopper
Vulnerability  : missing privilege release
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CAN-2005-1151 CAN-2005-1152

Two bugs have been discovered in qpopper, an enhanced Post Office
Protocol (POP3) server.  The Common Vulnerability and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-1151

    Jens Steube discovered that while processing local files owned or
    provided by a normal user privileges weren't dropped, which could
    lead to the overwriting or creation of arbitrary files as root.

CAN-2005-1152

    The upstream developers noticed that qpopper could be tricked to
    creating group- or world-writable files.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.4-2.woody.5.

For the testing distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.5-4sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed in
version 4.0.5-4sarge1.

We recommend that you upgrade your qpopper package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 08:09:10 UTC  ``` Two bugs have been discovered in qpopper, an enhanced Post Office Protocol (POP3) server.  The Common Vulnerability and Exposures project identifies the following problems:  CAN-2005-1151      Jens Steube discovered that while processing local files owned or     provided by a normal user privileges weren't dropped, which could     lead to the overwriting or creation of arbitrary files as root.  CAN-2005-1152      The upstream developers noticed that qpopper could be tricked to     creating group- or world-writable files. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 08:10:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 57390](attachment.cgi?id=57390 "patch.CAN-2005-1151.qpopper") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=57390&action=edit "patch.CAN-2005-1151.qpopper"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=57390&action=diff "patch.CAN-2005-1151.qpopper")] patch.CAN-2005-1151.qpopper ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 08:10:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 57391](attachment.cgi?id=57391 "patch.CAN-2005-1152.qpopper") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=57391&action=edit "patch.CAN-2005-1152.qpopper"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=57391&action=diff "patch.CAN-2005-1152.qpopper")] patch.CAN-2005-1152.qpopper ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-08 01:03:25 UTC  ``` Ferdy please advise.
