Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from PhotoPost's reliance on `magic_quotes_gpc` for input data filtering, which is a PHP feature that automatically escapes certain characters. The issue is that many users neglect to enable `magic_quotes_gpc`, making the application vulnerable. The application should implement proper input validation using `mysql_escape_string` or `mysql_real_escape_string` instead of relying on `magic_quotes_gpc`.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper input sanitization due to reliance on `magic_quotes_gpc`
- Lack of proper escaping of user-supplied input when `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary data can be retrieved from the database.
- In this specific exploit, the attacker retrieves admin MD5 hash and user name, which can lead to complete compromise of the application.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a specially crafted GET request to the `member.php` script with a modified `verifykey` parameter. This parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to know the path of the PhotoPost installation on the server.
- The attacker needs a way to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web server.
- The attacker needs a valid email address to receive the extracted admin information
