  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw in the Linux kernel's ELF binary format loader's core dump function allows for a kernel stack buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of the argument area of an ELF process during core dumping.",
      "Signed integer overflow leading to an incorrect length calculation.",
      "Failure to properly reset argument end pointers during program execution.",
       "Mmapping an ELF section with PROT_NONE to trigger a page fault and avoid proper argument length calculation"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can gain root privileges and execute arbitrary code at the kernel level. This may also lead to breaking out of virtual machines.",
    "attack_vectors": "A manipulated ELF binary is crafted to trigger a specific sequence of events within the kernel's core dumping process.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local access to the vulnerable system is required. The attacker needs to be able to execute specially crafted ELF binaries."
