Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in MetaCart2 for SQL Server Special Edition U.K. Specifically, the application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The identified weakness is SQL injection, present in several parameters across multiple ASP pages within the application. The affected parameters include `intProdID`, `intCatalogID`, `strSubCatalogID`, `chkText`, `strText`, `chkPrice`, `intPrice`, `chkCat`, and `strCat`. The parameters are vulnerable when crafting specific requests with malicious SQL injection strings such as `'SQL_INJECTION`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
- Access, modify, or delete sensitive data within the database.
- Bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Potentially gain control over the database server.
- Execute arbitrary commands on the server via extended stored procedures, if enabled.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests targeting specific ASP pages (`product.asp`, `productsByCategory.asp`, `searchAction.asp`) with malicious SQL injection payloads within the vulnerable query string parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges or prior access to the system is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
