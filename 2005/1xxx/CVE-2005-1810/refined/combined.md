How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-30 08:33:54 UTC  ``` Description: A vulnerability has been reported in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct SQL injection attacks.    Input passed to the "cat_ID" parameter isn't properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.    The vulnerability has been reported in version 1.5. Other versions may also be affected.  Solution: Update to version 1.5.1.2. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-30 08:35:16 UTC  ``` web-apps please bump.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Aaron Walker (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-30 09:14:32 UTC  ``` SuperLag, please bump.  Don't forget to update the metadata.xml with your info. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Aaron Kulbe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-31 09:53:03 UTC  ``` I committed 1.5.1.2 to the tree prior to this bug being created, so this should be taken care of. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-31 13:52:54 UTC  ``` So this is ready too ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-06 13:53:17 UTC  ``` GLSA 200506-04  ``` |  |

# Security Update

---

It has come to our attention that under certain circumstances there is a security vulnerability in WordPress that may be triggered if you’re running the default template. We were able to respond very quickly (under 40 minutes) and update the download to 1.5.1.2. You can upgrade by overwriting your old 1.5 files or if you would like to apply the fix manually it is relatively simple:

1. Open the `wp-includes/template-functions-category.php` file in a text editor like Wordpad.
2. Go to around line 103 where it says `get_the_category_by_ID`.
3. Create a new line after that and paste in `$cat_ID = (int) $cat_ID;`

After the problem was found we audited the codebase for any similar problems and nothing was found.

One note, even if the vulnerability was present in your blog, you would still be safe if your host ran `[mod_security](http://www.modsecurity.org/)` on their servers. It is an Apache module which can provide very high-level protection against everything like the vulnerability above to comment spam. We will be updating the [hosting page](https://wordpress.org/hosting/) shortly to reflect which hosts there support `mod_security` or not.

# Wordpress: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200506-04**

Wordpress contains SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/wordpress** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.1.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.1.2** |

### Background

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based content management and publishing
system.

### Description

Due to a lack of input validation, WordPress is vulnerable to SQL
injection and XSS attacks.

### Impact

An attacker could use the SQL injection vulnerabilities to gain
information from the database. Furthermore the cross-site scripting
issues give an attacker the ability to inject and execute malicious
script code or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials,
potentially compromising the victim's browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Wordpress users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-1.5.1.2"
```
### References

* [CVE-2005-1102](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1102)

WordPress is highly secure by default. Should  you be worried about this? Not if you haven't been worried by the past 5  years of blogging software or any other CMS in the world.  That said, I think a default feature restricting users lower than level  8 to a known subset of HTML would be useful, and will be including a  future release. A while back Mark Ghosh created the giant array that  KSES needs to accomplish this, I'm sure he (or I) still have it somewhere.  --  Matt Mullenweg ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-13 11:27:54 UTC  ``` I'm a bit concerned wbout that comment:  ============= > Owner logs on, sees a new draft, clicks on it to view, and has just lost  > his weblog.  That's pretty extreme. One person would have to invest a lot of time and  technical knowledge to execute that kind of exploit for very little (one  blog) payoff.  Additionally, if they do contain control (however they manage it, JS  XMLhttprequest *might* work) then what? They log in, post a bunch of  crap, hijack the blog for 20 minutes? Big deal. You should have backups,  and they don't actually have any passwords (they only have md5'd  cookies). So the recovery, sure, would be a pain, but would be quick.  Combine that with the minimal likely hood of this happening and I don't  think this comes close to anything critical. ==============  What he says basically is that you don't need security if you aren't the USAF or the NASA, and if you get hacked, so what, you've backups...  Let's wait a little and see if something comes out of this discussion. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-15 23:05:45 UTC  ``` Upstream still discussing what to do. Though the included file editor does not appear too smart security wise.

I've worked on a bump, but it's getting hard as upstream is not helping me at all.  I will continue and bump wordpress again, however I would like to request that, before I do so, security@ seriously consider serurity masking www-apps/wordpress.  Upstream clearly doesn't regard security very highly, and quite frankly, upstream have been a nightmare with this and other security issues - extracting blood from an ant comes to mind.  Again, apologies for being late on this one.  Being stretched very thing here ;) ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 01:04:11 UTC  ``` I don't want to waste more time on wordpress...

As I understand it, this only affects sites with multiple authors that have posting access.  Those with only one author, or with only a core group of authors who are fully trusted shouldn't have need to fear this potential vulnerability.    I agree that it should probably still be masked to protect the unwary, but perhaps the comment in /usr/portage/profiles/package.mask should direct users in the two cases I mentioned to feel free to unmask the file in /etc/portage/package.unmask? ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-03 13:43:33 UTC  ``` It references this bug and [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=88926#c18) is a fine description. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Marcel van den Bosch    2005-05-10 06:33:26 UTC  ``` Everything should be fixed in the new 1.5.1 version. ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-10 08:29:20 UTC  ``` The script issue seems to be solved, the iframe issue is not. ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-21 02:17:18 UTC  ``` Apparently there also is SQL injection...  ============================================================== From: 	  bugtraq@morph3us.org 	Subject: 	[BuHa Security] Wordpress SQL-Injection 	Date: 	May 19, 2005 11:52:58 PM EDT 	To: 	  bugtraq@securityfocus.com     --------------------------------------------------- | BuHa Security-Advisory #1     |    May 17th, 2005 |  --------------------------------------------------- | Vendor   | Wordpress                              | | URL      | <http://wordpress.org/>                  | | Version  | <= Wordpress 1.5                       | | Risk     | Moderate (SQL-Injection)               |  ---------------------------------------------------  o Description: =============  WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.   Visit <http://wordpress.org/> for detailed information.  o SQL-Injection: ===============  The most critical vulnerability in the 1.5 release of wordpress is an SQL-Injection in `wp-trackback.php'. It's not easily exploitable because you do not get a result when you inject a valid query but it's possible to bruteforce values in the tables - for example the password hashes.  Here some details: The parameter `tb_id' in `wp-trackback.php' is not validated correctly and there are no quotes in the SQL-query so an attacker is able to  insert sql commands.  $pingstatus = $wpdb->get_var("SELECT ping_status FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE ID = $tb_id"); 	 Example: (I converted the POST-request into a GET-request.)  $tb_id = 1 union select user_pass,0 from wp_users $url = bla $title = bla  </wp-trackback.php?tb_id=1%20union%20select%200,user_pass%20from%20 wp_users&url=bla&title=bla>  By injecting this query I get following databae error:  WordPress database error: [The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns] SELECT ping_status FROM wp_posts WHERE ID = 1 union select 0,  user_pass from wp_users  When I insert "1 union select user_pass from wp_users" as value for `tb_id' I get no error message because the query was well-formed - logical. Through the possibility to insert any sql-command it's possible to 'reconstruct' values of the tables.  o XSS: =====  </wp-admin/edit.php?s=[XSS]&submit=Search> </wp-admin/post.php?action=confirmdeletecomment&comment=1&p=[XSS]>  o Path Disclosure: =================  </wordpress-1.5-strayhorn/wp-content/themes/*> </wordpress-1.5-strayhorn/wp-includes/*> </wordpress-1.5-strayhorn/wp-admin/*>  Fatal error: Call to undefined function add_filter() in [...]/htdocs/testenv/blogs/wordpress/wordpress-1.5-strayhorn/ wp-content/themes/classic/comments-popup.php on line 3  o Disclosure Timeline: =====================  17 Apr 05 - Security flaws discovered. 19 Apr 05 - Vendor contacted. 10 May 05 - Vendor released bugfixed version. 17 May 05 - Public release.  o Solution: ==========  Upgrade to wordpress 1.5.1 [1]  o Credits: =========  Thomas Waldegger <bugtraq@morph3us.org> BuHa-Security Community - <http://buha.info/board/>  [1] <http://wordpress.org/development/2005/05/one-five-one/> ============================================================= ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-21 02:18:04 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 93355](show_bug.cgi?id=93355 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - wordpress <1.5 SQL injection") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-21 02:18:48 UTC  ``` Back in main scope for discussion ```  [Comment 26](#c26)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-22 22:37:23 UTC  ``` Release note for 1.5.1.1 does not mention a fix of the iframe issue.    <http://wordpress.org/development/2005/05/one-five-one/>    Is the iframe issue also relevant for comments or only posts?  ```  [Comment 27](#c27)  Aaron Kulbe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-24 11:57:55 UTC  ``` Potential issues with PHP were having display_errors turned on in php.ini, which goes against the advice of the PHP developers for use in a production environment.  It would allow security info to be displayed that was unnecessary.  Also, iframe is only an issue if the blog admin gives a new user the rights to publish and said user goes berserk and starts doing malicious things.  If the admin keeps things locked down, this isn't an issue at all.  This can happen on ANY platform if permissions are too loose.  There *have* been security issues found with users being able to reset admin passwords, and the password would go back to the original ownser.  This issue has been fixed in 1.5.1.1  Perhaps adding some einfo text is warranted, mentioning to users that they should take care who they give privileges too, but this is common sense.  In my opinion, it should be bumped to 1.5.1.1 ASAP, and this can be removed from package.mask and moved to ~.  ```  [Comment 28](#c28)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-25 06:48:26 UTC  ``` I think 1.5.1.1 can be unmasked. webapps please bump if you agree. ```  [Comment 29](#c29)  Aaron Kulbe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-27 08:01:01 UTC  ``` ka0ttic said I could go ahead and bump.
