ColdFusion MX 7 cross-site scripting in default error page

Originally posted: May 10, 2005

~~~~~~~

SUMMARY

The default error page in the optional-use JRun Web Server
bundled with ColdFusion MX 7 is vulnerable to a cross-site
scripting attack.

~~~~~~~

SOLUTION

Define a custom error page or download and install the
patch referenced below or use an alternative Web Server
with ColdFusion.

~~~~~~~

Affected Software Versions

ColdFusion MX 7.0

~~~~~~~

Severity Rating

Macromedia categorizes this issue as a moderate update and
recommends users patch their installations immediately.

~~~~~~~

Details

A specially encoded URL can be used to create a cross-site
scripting attack through the default 404 error page.
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a user to follow
a hyperlink to a page that doesnt exist on the server.

Most customers using ColdFusion MX 7 will not be affected
by this vulnerability because the majority of customers run
ColdFusion MX 7 with other web servers. This vulnerability
does not affect ColdFusion servers using connectors to any
other web server such as IIS or Apache. Although the JRun
Web Server is included with ColdFusion MX 7, it is not
recommended for use in production environments and is
intended for configuration, evaluation and testing purposes
only.

~~~~~~~

Making the Changes

NOTE: Back up your existing files before making changes.
As always, test the changes in a non-production environment
before applying the changes to production servers.

Install the security patch from the ColdFusion MX 7
Administrator. The installation process is the same for
all platforms and installation choices.

1. Download chf70-60112.jar (2K).

2. Open the ColdFusion MX 7 Administrator and select the
System Information page.

3. Next to the Update File field, select the Browse Button
and browse to the downloaded file.

4. Select the file and click Submit.

5. Restart ColdFusion.

The ColdFusion MX 7 hot fix JAR file does not need to be
retained after installing it with the ColdFusion
Administrator. The file has been copied into the correct
location.

The ColdFusion MX 7 hot fix JAR file will appear in the
System Information list.
