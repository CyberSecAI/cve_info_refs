Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security bulletin:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The default error page in the JRun Web Server (bundled with ColdFusion MX 7) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the default 404 error page. This is due to the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the error page. When a user visits a non-existent page on the server (triggering the 404 error), the injected script will be executed in the user's browser. This could potentially lead to:
    - Cookie theft.
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirection to a malicious website.
    - Other malicious actions within the user's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that triggers a 404 error. The injected script is placed within the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure the victim into clicking the link or redirect the victim via other means (e.g. malicious ad). The attacker doesn't need to have any access to the server.

**Additional details:**

* The bulletin explicitly mentions that this vulnerability primarily affects customers using the JRun webserver bundled with ColdFusion MX 7, which is not recommended for production environments. Customers using other webservers are not vulnerable.
* The bulletin provides a patch (chf70-60112.jar) and instructions on how to apply it via the ColdFusion MX 7 Administrator. It also suggests using a custom error page or switching to a different webserver as alternative mitigation steps.
* The advisory categorizes this as a "moderate" issue and recommends patching immediately.
* The advisory contains the standard disclaimers and limitation of liability statements from Macromedia.
