How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately-reported vulnerability. This vulnerability could enable an attacker to spoof trusted Internet content. The vulnerability is documented in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

We recommend that customers consider applying the security update.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 98, 98 SE, ME | Windows 2000 | Windows XP Service Pack 1 | Windows XP Service Pack 2 | Windows Server 2003 | Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Agent Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-1214](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-1214) | Spoofing | Not Critical | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Low | Low |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The severity ratings for non-x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating systems versions as follows:

* The Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) severity rating is the same as the Windows XP Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) severity rating is the same as the Windows XP Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows XP Service Pack 2 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why am I receiving this update?**

Customers who did not receive updates prior to MS06-068 may not have received MS05-032 and therefore should apply this update immediately. However, customers who have installed both MS06-068 and MS07-045 will have the security update provided by MS05-032 and do not need to install MS05-032 separately. Customers who have installed MS06-068 only, or who have not installed both MS06-068 and MS07-045, should install MS05-032.

**Why did Microsoft update this bulletin on August 9, 2005**

Microsoft updated this bulletin today to advise customers that a revised version of the security update is available for the following systems:

* Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems
* Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition
* Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition

The original security update successfully addressed the vulnerability described in this security bulletin for non 64-bit systems. No additional action is required for non 64-bit customers. However, on 64-bit systems, the kill bit documented in the âDoes this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?â FAQ does not correctly get enabled when using a 32-bit version of Internet Explorer. The kill bit does correctly get enabled for 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer. We recommend customers install the revised security update even if you have installed the previous version. The revised security update, as appropriate, will be available through Windows Update, Software Update Services (SUS), and will be recommended by the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA). It is not necessary to uninstall the prior security update prior to installing the revised security update.

**Note** Due to the end of support on June 30, 2005, for some Itanium based systems, the revised security update will not be available on the following operating system versions:

* Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium)
* Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)

See the FAQ âSecurity update support for Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?â for more information if you are using those operating systems versions.

**Security update support for Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) ended on June 30, 2005.Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

With the release of Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1 (Itanium) and Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium) will no longer receive security update support. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. Microsoft will continue to fully support Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based systems, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions for 64-bit computing requirements. Microsoft continues to license and support Windows Server 2003 Enterprise and Datacenter editions for Itanium-based systems, and the 64-bit version of SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition. In the future we will expand Itanium support to Visual Studio 2005, .NET Framework 2005 and SQL Server 2005.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Microsoft Agent Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1214:

This is a spoofing vulnerability that exists in the affected products and that could enable an attacker to spoof trusted Internet content. Users could believe that they are accessing trusted Internet content. However, they are accessing malicious Internet content such as a malicious Web site. An attacker would first have to persuade a user to visit the attackerâs site to attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Agent Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1214:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Agent Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1214:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to disable running ActiveX controls in these zones.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to disable running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.
  4. Repeat step 1 through step 3 and select the **Local intranet** security zone.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting. See the âRestrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sitesâ workaround for information about how you can add sites to the Trusted sites zone.

  Alternatively, you can change your settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls only. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX Controls and Plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plugs-ins**, click **Prompt**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to disabling running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX controls to provide additional functionality. Disabling running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to disable ActiveX controls for all sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.
* **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to disable ActiveX controls in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Agent Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1214:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a spoofing vulnerability. This vulnerability could enable an attacker to spoof trusted Internet content. Users could believe that they are accessing trusted Internet content. However, they are accessing malicious Internet content such as a malicious Web site. An attacker would first have to persuade a user to visit the attackerâs site to attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Security prompts can be disguised by a Microsoft Agent character. A user could be convinced to unintentionally allow the installation of malicious software.

**What is Microsoft Agent?**

Microsoft Agent is a software technology that enables an enriched form of user interaction that can make using and learning to use a computer easier and more natural. For more information, see the [Microsoft Agent Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/msagent/).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could spoof trusted Internet content. Users could believe they are accessing trusted Internet content when in reality they are accessing malicious Internet content. Security prompts, as well as other types of Internet content, could be spoofed if an attacker is successfully able to exploit this vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous attacker who could display a specially crafted Web page to a user could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. It could also be possible to display malicious Web content using banner advertisements or other ways to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability.

**What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the **Security** tab and on the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* The security level for the Internet zone is set to **High**. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Agent references characters. Users will now be prompted before a Microsoft Agent character is installed.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Notes** The Windows XP security update is packaged as a dual-mode package. Dual-mode packages contain files for the original version of Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) and files for Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2).
For more information about dual-mode packages, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 328848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/328848).
When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:

* Windows XP SP2
  The installer copies the SP2QFE files to your system.
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)
  The installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system.

If you have not previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:

* Windows XP SP2
  The installer copies the SP2GDR files to your system.
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)
  The installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyze, Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
