Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-1214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Agent handles character references, specifically that security prompts can be disguised by a Microsoft Agent character. This allows an attacker to potentially convince a user to unintentionally allow the installation of malicious software by spoofing trusted Internet content using a disguised security prompt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to spoof trusted Internet content. An attacker can create a malicious website that displays a disguised security prompt through a Microsoft Agent character, making the user believe they are interacting with legitimate content.
- **Lack of User Prompts for Character Installation**: The vulnerability allows the installation of a Microsoft Agent character without a user prompt, which leads to the disguised security prompt.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Spoofing Trusted Content:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to spoof trusted Internet content, potentially leading users to interact with malicious sites and content.
- **Malware Installation:** An attacker could potentially trick users into installing malicious software if a disguised prompt is used to request this.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system after successful exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious web page that contains a specially crafted Microsoft Agent character to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to visit the malicious web page, often by tricking the user into clicking a link, or via banner ads and other web content delivery methods.
- **User interaction required**: The user has to perform several actions after visiting the malicious site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host a web site or deliver web content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website with malicious content or use other means to deliver web content to the victim.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to visit the malicious site.
- **No prior access needed**: The attacker doesn't need any credentials or access to the target system prior to the attack.
