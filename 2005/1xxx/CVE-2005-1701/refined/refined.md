Title: SQL injections in PortailPHP
The program: PortailPHP v 1.3

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by the absence of filtration of the "id" parameter before using it in SQL queries.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
SQL injection vulnerability exists in the "id" parameter. The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to manipulate the database, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, modification or deletion of data.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is through the "id" parameter in the URL.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, which typically means they can be any user able to reach the server. The attacker needs to insert SQL injection payloads in place of the parameter `id` in the URL.
