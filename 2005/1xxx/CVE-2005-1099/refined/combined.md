# Gld: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200504-10**

Gld contains several serious vulnerabilities, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code as the root user.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-filter/gld** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5** |

### Background

Gld is a standalone greylisting server for Postfix.

### Description

dong-hun discovered several buffer overflows in server.c, as well as
several format string vulnerabilities in cnf.c.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code
with the permissions of the user running Gld, the default user being
root.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Gld users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-filter/gld-1.5"
```

01/05/2006 : V 1.7
- Removed the KEEPDBOPEN option as it could lead to multiple instance of gld running
when mail traffic is low and thus father process MYSQL connection timeout .
Furthermore, after tests, efficency is the same .
KEEPDBOPEN option is now silently ignored to forced to NO .
16/09/2005 : V 1.6
- Removed the algorithm lightgreydomain as the new mxgrey does better and simpler
- Removed the UPDATE option, now gld always update triplets .
- Fixed a minor flaw in the MXGREY algorithm.
- Now you can configure MXGREY to consider an ip as a safe MX after X succesful
greylists instead of only 1 . (read gld.conf for details)
- Now gld updates the counters only when mail is not greylisted
- Added Training mode, read gld.conf for details
- Now gld verify that if you supply a custom smtp code, it's a 4XX code
otherwise gld discard it and use 450 .
- If gld cannot connect to MySQL server on startup
it will not refuse to run anymore, but will set keepdbopen to 0 and accept to run .
- The sample config file provided now only listen to loopback
only accept connection from localhost and runs as nobody/ nobody.
WARNING: if you were using lightgreydomain algorithm, it has been discontinued
use MXGREY in place, please read gld.conf for details.
21/04/2005 : V 1.5.2
- Fixed a bug in MXGREY algorithm
13/04/2005 : V 1.5
- Fixed several possible buffer overflow by removing all sprintf() calls
and replacing them by snprintf()
- Added pgsql support, use configure --with-pgsql to compile
gld with pgsql support
- Added the MXGREY parameter, please read gld.conf for details.
- Added KEEPDBOPEN parameter, please read gld.conf for details.
- Added Configurable SMTP return code
- Updated the white list to the lastest known.
19/08/2004 : V 1.4
- Added the USER and GROUP parameters to allow running gld
as a specific user/group instead of root.
- Added the LIGHTGREYDOMAIN parameter for greylisting on domains
please read gld.conf for details.
- Added CLIENTS parameter, to restrict clients allowed to connect to gld.
15/08/2004 : V 1.3.1
- Parameters are now checked to avoid a possible buffer overflow
- Parameters are now checked to avoid a possible SQL injection
- Fixed the bug which makes gld crash when displaying infos for an empty database
19/07/2004 : V 1.3
- Now, when LIGHTGREY is active, full ip+network is checked in whitlists
instead of the network only.
- Added the LOOPBACKONLY parameter, to make gld listen only to loopback (127.0.0.1) .
- Added the DNSW parameter for DNS whitelist support (cf DNSWL in gld.conf)
- Added the FACILITY parameter to define the syslog facility we want to use
- Added the -C switch to simulate what -c would do
- Added the -k and -K switchs to clean the one hits entries in the database
- Added the -i switch to display some database informations
- Added the -d switch to enable debug mode
- Added in the documentation a mini howto to setup postfix to greylist only some emails/domains.
25/06/2004 : V 1.2
- Improved child management to avoid zombies on some BSD.
Thanks to Michael Rasmussen  that solved the bug that caused
gld to leave spawned children as zombies on BSD.
- Added the light greylisting algorithm (cf LIGHTGREY parameter in gld.conf).
- Added the -c option to gld to clean up the database (try gld -h).
- All options have now a default value and are no more mandatory.
- gld now use a configure script and should be easier to compile on some unixes.
- Improved documentation and given a postfix configuration example.
20/06/2004 : V 1.1
- Some tries, this version has never been released.
10/05/2004 : V 1.0

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
