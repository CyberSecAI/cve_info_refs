The ebuild has  no metadata and has had no meaningful meaningful modification for over 2 years,  I was unable to connect to any supported network to test the application.   upstream site is down, and looks like this project has been abandoned, I would  suggest masking. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Romang    2005-05-30 15:32:02 UTC  ``` ok for masking :) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-30 22:23:49 UTC  ``` Gustavo/Don any comments or should it just be masked prior to complete  removal?  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-04 00:48:49 UTC  ``` Oliver/Karol please advise.  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Olivier Crete (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-04 09:24:00 UTC  ``` go for the masking ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Karol Wojtaszek (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-05 02:08:24 UTC  ``` it should go for the masking ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-05 06:33:00 UTC  ``` Patchers/maintainers please mask.  ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-08 01:31:48 UTC  ``` MAsked prior to complete removal ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Olivier Crete (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-07 11:12:39 UTC  ``` what are we waiting for to completely remove it ? ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-08-08 02:27:11 UTC  ``` We usually wait a few months...
