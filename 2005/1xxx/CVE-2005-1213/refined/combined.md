### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately-reported vulnerability. The vulnerability is documented in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why is Microsoft updating this bulletin?**

Microsoft is updating this bulletin as this is not a cumulative security update. In order to protect your system against vulnerabilities you will need to apply all relevant security updates.

**Iâve installed security update MS05-030 and am still being offered MS04-018; do I need to install security update MS04-018 as well?**

Yes. Because MS05-030 is not a cumulative security update, you will still be offered MS04-018 if it has not been previously installed. MS05-030 contains all of the security updates addressed in MS04-018, with the exception of a functionality change that was introduced in MS03-014. This functionality change creates a copy of the Windows Address Book in a predictable location with a file name of â~â on systems running Outlook Express 6 SP1 and later. MS04-018 is necessary to fix this behavior. It is recommended that you install both MS05-030 and MS04-018 to help protect your system.

**Iâve installed security update MS05-030 and am still being offered MS04-018; but I canât install it. What should I do?**

The security update accompanying MS04-018 must be installed before MS05-030. If MS05-030 has already been installed, you will need to uninstall it. Once MS04-18 has been installed, you will need to reinstall MS05-030 to help protect your system.

**How does the extended support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition affect the release of security updates for these operating systems?**

Microsoft will only release security updates for critical security issues. Non-critical security issues are not offered during this support period. For more information about the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policies for these operating systems, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33327).

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

MBSA does not support Outlook Express, and does not detect whether the update is required for Outlook Express. However, Microsoft has developed a version of the [Enterprise Update Scan Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) (EST). This tool helps customers determine whether this security update is required.
For detailed information about the programs that MBSA currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to providing detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command-line interface and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better use the tool, [detailed documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool that will determine whether you have to apply this update. For more information about the version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool that is being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). There is also a version of this tool that Systems Management Server (SMS) customers can obtain. To obtain this version of the tool, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154). This tool may also be available for SMS customers from the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.

However, there is a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool that SMS customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators. To obtain this version of the tool, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894194). For more information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Outlook Express News Reading Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1213:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Outlook Express when it is used as a newsgroup reader. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious newsgroup server that could that potentially allow remote code execution if a user queried the server for news. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors Outlook Express News Reading Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1213:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. These actions would include setting up and configuring Outlook Express to use the attackerâs newsgroup server or a newsgroup server that the attacker has compromised. An attack could only occur after the attacker performed these actions.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Outlook Express News Reading Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1213:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. These workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability. However, they help block known attack vectors. Workarounds may reduce functionality in some cases; in such cases, the reduction in functionality is identified below.

* Block Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)traffic on ports 119 TCP and 119 UDP. Only allow connections to trusted newsgroup servers through your firewall.
* Block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems. Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).
* Do not connect to untrusted newsgroup servers.

#### FAQ for NNTP Outlook Express News Reading Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1213:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the NNTP Response Parsing function in Outlook Express.

**What is the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) component**

The NNTP component provides a service that enables the distribution, retrieval, and posting of news articles among the Internet community. NNTP is designed so that news articles are stored in a central database, allowing a subscriber to select only those items that they want to read. For more information about NNTP, see the [NNTP product documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/standard/proddocs/default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/standard/proddocs/nntp_administration.asp?frame=true). NNTP is defined in Request for Comment (RFC) documents [RFC 977](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc977.txt) and [RFC 2980](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2980.txt).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any attacker who could convince a user to connect to a malicious NNTP server. An attacker would have no way to force a customer to connect to an NNTP server.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to configure Outlook Express to connect to a malicious NNTP server or by compromising an existing NNTP Server. The attacker could then create a specially crafted response and send the response to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to execute code.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Users who use Outlook Express as their newsgroup reader are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Although Windows Millennium Edition does contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Outlook Express, when it is used as a newsgroup reader, validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows Server 2003, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB897715\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 897715 security update into the Windows installation source files.

## Microsoft Outlook Express vulnerable to remote code execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#130614

Original Release Date: 2005-06-14 | Last Revised: 2005-06-20

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook Express's NNTP response parsing may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| [Microsoft Outlook Express](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/oe/) contains support for Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) data, which is defined in [RFC 977](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc977.txt) and [RFC 2980](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2980.txt). A flaw in Outlook Express' handling of NNTP responses may lead to a buffer overflow condition if a specially-crafted reply is sent by a compromised or malicious NNTP server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to control an NNTP server that a host is connected to may be able to execute arbitrary code in the security context of the local user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  Please see [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-030](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS05-030.mspx) for more information, such as workarounds and patches. |
| --- |

| **Utilize Workarounds**A number of workarounds are indicated in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-030](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS05-030.mspx), including:Block access to NNTP traffic, which commonly utilizes TCP port 119 and UDP port 119. |
