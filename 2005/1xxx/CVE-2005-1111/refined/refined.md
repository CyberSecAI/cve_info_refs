    {
      "source": "marc.info_fcc553ab_20250125_213959.html",
      "root_cause": "The cpio utility has a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerability in how it sets file permissions after extracting or compressing a file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race condition: The file is extracted and the file descriptor closed before the file is chmod'ed.",
        "There's a gap between the uncompressed file being written and its file handler being closed, and the permissions of the file being changed."
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious local user can exploit this to change the permissions of any file belonging to the target user. They can remove the decompressed file and replace it with a hard-link to another file, then cpio will change the permissions on the hard-linked file.",
       "attack_vector": "A malicious local user must have write access to a directory where a target user is using cpio to extract or compress a file.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local user with write access to a directory."

    {
      "source": "www.debian.org_4451d366_20250125_214006.html",
       "root_cause": "Race condition in setting file permissions and lack of path sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race condition when setting file permissions of extracted files.",
        "Path traversal vulnerability: cpio does not sanitize the path of extracted files, even when the --no-absolute-filenames option is specified."
      ],
       "impact": "A local attacker with write access to the target directory can alter the permissions of arbitrary files the extracting user has write permissions for. Also, files can be installed in arbitrary locations where the extracting user has write permissions.",
      "attack_vector": "Local attacker with write access to the target directory or a malicious cpio archive.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local user with write access to the target directory or a malicious cpio archive."

       "source": "www.ubuntu.com_e6545c1b_20250125_214009.html",

      "weaknesses": [
         "Race condition vulnerability while unpacking a file.",
        "Path traversal vulnerability when the --no-absolute-filenames option is used."
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker with write permissions can change the permissions of arbitrary files of the cpio user. Additionally, a malicious cpio archive can be used to install files in arbitrary paths with the privileges of the user calling cpio.",
       "attack_vector": "Local attacker with write access or tricking a user into unpacking a malicious archive.",
