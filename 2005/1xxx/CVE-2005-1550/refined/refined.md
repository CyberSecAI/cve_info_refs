Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an input validation error in the `easymsgb.pl` script of Easy Message Board. Specifically, the `print` variable, when passed to the `open()` function, lacks proper data sanitization or control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`) in the `print` parameter. This allows reading of arbitrary files on the server.
- **Remote Command Execution:** The vulnerability also allows the execution of arbitrary commands by injecting commands via the `print` parameter (e.g., `print=|id|>`). The `open()` function will interpret the input as commands if the input begins with `|`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`.
- **Remote Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver user, leading to a complete compromise of the vulnerable system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `easymsgb.pl` script, specifically manipulating the `print` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable application. No prior authentication or special privileges are required.
