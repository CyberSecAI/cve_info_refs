Package        : simpleproxy
Vulnerability  : format string vulnerability
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-1857

Ulf Harnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project discoverd a
format string vulnerability in simpleproxy, a simple TCP proxy, that
can be exploited via replies from remote HTTP proxies.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2-3sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your simpleproxy package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
