# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-41

## Privilege escalation via DOM property overrides

Announced
April 15, 2005
Reporter
moz\_bug\_r\_a4
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.3
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.7

### Description

moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported several exploits giving an attacker
the ability to install malicious code or steal data, requiring only
that the user do commonplace actions like click on a link or open
the context menu. The common cause in each case was privileged UI code
("chrome") being overly trusting of DOM nodes from the content window.
Scripts in the web page can override properties and methods of DOM
nodes and shadow the native values, unless steps are taken to get the
true underlying values.

We found that most extensions also interacted with content DOM in a
natural, but unsafe, manner.
Changes were made so that chrome code using this natural DOM coding style
will now automatically use the native DOM value if it exists without having
to use cumbersome wrapper objects.

Most of the specific exploits involved tricking the privileged code
into calling eval() on an attacker-supplied script string, or the equivalent
using the Script() object. Checks were added in the security manager
to make sure eval and Script objects are run with the privileges of the
context that created them, not the potentially elevated privileges of
the context calling them.

See [Bug 217195](/show_bug.cgi?id=217195 "RESOLVED FIXED - security hole in markLinkVisited (exploit with link.href setter = eval)"), its fix is not sufficient.
Vulnerable code:
from markLinkVisited in contentAreaUtils.js
var oldHref = linkNode.getAttribute("href");
linkNode.setAttribute("href", "");
linkNode.setAttribute("href", oldHref);
Exploit:
It is possible to execute the second argument, such as the following.
eval.setAttribute = eval.call;
eval.setAttribute("href", code);
|eval| can work with XPCNativeWrapper, such as the following.
(|new XPCNativeWrapper(eval, "href").href| works as
|new XPCNativeWrapper(linkNode, "href").href|.)
linkNode = document.links[0];
eval.\_\_proto\_\_ = linkNode;
It is possible to pass |eval| as linkNode, such as the following.
<a href="#"><span>test</span></a>
document.links[0].firstChild
.\_\_defineGetter\_\_('parentNode', function() { return eval; });
I have confirmed that the following testcase works in:

Turns out that the problem here is that it's possible to trick our code to
execute JS code with chrome priveleges using eval, even if the eval function and
the object passed as the 'this' parameter is from content code. That should not
be the case, the code that is being evaluated should run with the priveleges of
the page where the 'this' param came from. I'm going to dupe the other similar
bugs against this one and push the fix in here.

[Register an objectPrincipalFinder with the JS engine to ensure that it finds the right principal when using eval](attachment.cgi?id=179828&action=diff)

This fixes this problem by registering an object principal finder which Brendan
already provided in the JS engine, but was never used. This ensures that the JS
engine can find the right principal when calling eval.

I've tested in Firefox/1.0.3-2005-04-06-06.
The testcases I've sent before does not work anymore, however, I've found that
it is still exploitable, by using function in the code.
//var code = "alert('Exploit!\\n\\n' + Components.stack);";
var code = "(function() { alert('Exploit!\\n\\n' + Components.stack); })();";

Is that really the check we want? Should a script with UniversalXPConnect be
able to do this? Should both directions be banned?

shaver: I don't actually want this case to work, for anyone. If I had my head
screwed on right ten years ago, I would have made eval a reserved identifier, a
true special form -- no function reference extractable to be passed to victims.
UniversalXPConnect wouldn't have mattered, in that case. Let's pretend I did
implement eval that way, ok?

the kludge which stops testcase 3 (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US;

though it stops eval, looks like a lot of other functions like
navigator.preference(a,b) and InstallTrigger.install (crashes) may be called.

Those are all native function objects. When called from chrome, they should not
have privileges. One more "kludge" coming up (because we really don't want to
take the patch for [bug 281988](/show_bug.cgi?id=281988 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop sharing DOM object wrappers between content and chrome") in a hurry).

brendan,
are you saying that chrome will not be able to call at least netscape.preference
and InstallTrigger.\* with full privilege?

I was rather thinking that \*content\* native function objects should not have
privilege when called from chrome -- only chrome native function objects (that
is, native function objects whose scope chain ends in a chrome window) should
have privilege.
But that is too much: it breaks chrome calls into the content's DOM native
function objects (setAttribute on a link, and many other valid cases).
Fooey. We need jst's patch for [bug 281988](/show_bug.cgi?id=281988 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop sharing DOM object wrappers between content and chrome"), I keep saying this. Anything else
is putting fingers in holes in the dyke, and there are more holes than fingers.
I'm backing out my kludge.

mscott: sorry about that. To make up for it, I didn't just remove that bogus
assertion -- I backed the whole patch out. ;-) It's stupid to stick mandatory
access controls in a bunch of natives; we're going for a systematic, low-level
fix over in [bug 281988](/show_bug.cgi?id=281988 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop sharing DOM object wrappers between content and chrome").

[Attempt at preventing chrome from seeing shadowed properties (xpconnect diff)](attachment.cgi?id=180005&action=diff)

This aint done, there are obvious performance problems with this change, but it
shows our current direction. This makes it so that content can't shadow DOM
properties from chrome code (or the patch simply prevents code with different
principals from shadowing from each other, but that'll change). This is WIP,
and needs more eyeballs and more testing, and it must not suck as bad as this
does performance wise. Please have a look and comment ASAP.

Just for sanity, maybe for older MSVC or Borland or who-knows-what
compiler/linkers, you want JS\_FRIEND\_API around the return type in the
definition of js\_InternalGetOrSet over in jsinterp.c, too.

Idea: test cx->fp->scopeChain == wrapper->mMaybeScope->mGlobalJSObject (pass
wrapper as well as obj) and return false early if true. I'm not sure when
mMaybeScope is valid (it's in a union with mMaybeProto), so if this does not
work out (we'd want an inline helper in xpcprivate.h to hide the ugly details),
you could always use JS\_GetParent(cx, obj).
I pointed out this fast path to bz, and he said "why isn't caps using it?!"
Good question! I said "a=me for 1.8b2" ;-)

I'm wondering why we don't want to call the getter if idval identifies an
attribute, here -- or rather, I bet this low-level JSClass.getProperty hook is
never called for an attribute, because its JSScopeProperty that might be in the
property cache was found via the JSObjectOps.getProperty hook impl'd just
below, which always calls the getter if an attribute is found when crossing
trust domains and ignoring any overriding JS property.
I'll have to think about this more, but jst: if you can prove the class hook is
called for an attribute, let me know how that happens.

This looks good.
So the XPCWrappedNative JSObjectOps (all of 'em ;-) just copy the native
js\_ObjectOps.lookupProperty hook, which calls JSClass.resolve (with
JSCLASS\_NEW\_RESOLVE). That means (memory here, check me) we're lazily
populating WN prototypes from typeinfo. That says we can end up with property
cache references to JSScopeProperty nodes that have JSPROP\_GETTER in their
attributes, which makes me wonder again why callGetter isn't always true.
I say get the perf improvement suggested above in, try to answer some of the
questions we've raised, and get this into the AVIARY\_1\_0\_1\_...BRANCH for
respins so we can unleash some testers on it. Thanks yet again,

So mMaybeScope/mMaybeProto are discriminated by the low bit, a pointer tag bit.
So all we need for the fast-path condition is
cx->fp->scopeChain == wrapper->GetScope()->GetGlobalJSObject()
I recommend including jscntxt.h and jsinterp.h (already have the latter) and not
messing around with jsdbgapi.h function calls for the left operand of ==.

So bz's [bug 281988 comment 46](/show_bug.cgi?id=281988#c46 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop sharing DOM object wrappers between content and chrome") raises the point he, jst and then latecoming I
talked about on IRC: gotta do something to prevent content from using
\_\_defineGetter\_\_ to replace 0, 1, etc. on a DOM element that's array-like.
Or let it do that but catch it at the XPC\_WN\_JSOp\_... level. We must prove that
there's no way a JSObjectOps.lookupProperty result could return a
JSScopeProperty pointer that gets into the property cache, for such a replaced
index getter. If that happens, and if chrome uses such indexing, it could end
up calling the getter with none of the code in this patch in the path.

Don't throw exceptions if we're asked to call a setter for a readonly prop (jus assert for now).
Let's fuse the js\_InternalGetOrSet call in GetUnshadowedMemberValue like we do
in XPC\_WN\_Safe\_GetterSetterThunkNative. (And tweak the assertion
appropriately, natch.)
Also, would it be worthwhile to stick id and unsafe\_gsobj in properties named
by tinyids, or perhaps in private slots, to speed access?
r=shaver, though; I can't find anything that looks wrong to me, in there.

Tinyids don't speed access, they allow a shared (class) getter or setter to
handle many similar special cases of getting or setting. Anyway, we're not
changing the Function object's class for this.
Private slots would be cool, but it's not worth the trouble here.

The 2005-04-08-18 build is working great. Extensions that were originally broken
by the uber-patch in [bug 281988](/show_bug.cgi?id=281988 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop sharing DOM object wrappers between content and chrome") now work again (Chatzilla and AdBlock, mainly),
and DOMInspector works and can see all JS properties except any that explicitly
try to hide a native property. Blocks the exploit testcases.
Whoo hoo!

I've tested in Firefox/1.0.3 2005-04-08-18 on Win XP.
The following code causes crash.
document.body.\_\_defineGetter\_\_('localName', new Script());
But, the following code doesn't.
document.body.\_\_proto\_\_.\_\_defineGetter\_\_('localName', new Script());

Trivial. We don't need unsafe\_gsfun, it was just for propagating the name of
the user-defined getter or setter to the thunk, but that's not necessary. It's
safe and simpler to make the thunk anonymous.

I've tested in Firefox/1.0.3 2005-04-09-06 on Win XP.
It is still unsafe to use |\_\_proto\_\_| in Chrome JS. For instance,
|content.getSelection| is the real native function, but,
|content.\_\_proto\_\_.getSelection| can be the function created by a web page.
Thus, the vulnerability represented in [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=289074#c23 "RESOLVED FIXED - security hole in markLinkVisited (Bug 217195) has not been fixed") is still alive. And it seems
that the fix for [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=289074#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - security hole in markLinkVisited (Bug 217195) has not been fixed") has been reverted, thus, [Bug 289075](/show_bug.cgi?id=289075 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - security hole in View Selection Source") has become
exploitable again.
And, if there is no real getter/setter, the user-defined getter/setter will be used.
(Is this behavior benefited by unsafe\_gsfun? if so, already fixed.)
Thus, the following code can exploit.
// Body doesn't have |rel| property
document.body.\_\_defineGetter\_\_("rel", function() {
return { toString : new Script(code) };
});
var event = document.createEvent("Events");
event.initEvent("DOMLinkAdded", true, true);
document.body.dispatchEvent(event);

Thanks moz\_bug\_r\_a4, you deserve more bug bounties :-).
jst and I almost saw the completely undefended state of XPConnect wrapped native
prototype objects, as noted in this comment in our recent patch:
// XXXbe and XXXjst
// Can't use THROW\_AND\_RETURN\_IF\_BAD\_WRAPPER here since this
// hook gets called from what looks like prototype wrappers,
// and for those JSObjects we don't find a wrapper (when
// called through someobj.\_\_proto\_\_.somefunction.call). Let
// those calls fall through to the stub for now.
We suck for not figuring this out fully and fixing it, but we'll do that now.
The other missing defense, which dbaron fully foresaw days ago, is chrome using
properties not pre-defined by XPConnect at all (via XPCOM interface reflection
or JS interface implementation followed by successful QueryInterface). That's
the target.rel exploit, in part.
The final part of the target.rel attack is that chrome trusts content-generated
events, and jst has a patch to fix that, but we think it's 1.8b2 material only
right now.

Besides ripping out the vulnerable \*.\_\_proto\_\_.\*.call(...) pattern from Firefox
chrome JS, this breaks any such usage at the XPConnect level by failing chrome
gets and sets on content wrapped native prototypes with XPC\_BAD\_OP\_ON\_WN\_PROTO.
We still need to do something about chrome gets and sets of content properties
that do not shadow an xpconnect member. And about chrome trusting
untrustworthy content-generated events.

jst: thanks, forgot an else (wanted to let the common return wrapper; at the
bottom handle the null case). Fixed.
I wonder if I should also amend the patch to avoid thunking when chrome script
defines a getter or a setter. That counts on the misnomer
IsCrossTrustDomainCall really meaning IsChromeToContentCall (or GetOrSet).
Thoughts?

Seems reasonable. I don't see a point in trying to protect antything in that
case, and we'd save ourselves a bit on performance when calling such
getters/setters (but loose a bit when defining, I guess).

Someone else will have to attach a patch for these -- I don't have the trees for
1.7 branch SeaMonkey and aviary 1.0.1 branch Thunderbird pulled.

Interdiff'ing may help. Main change is to avoid wrapping a script-defined
getter or setter with the safe thunk if the caller is chrome/native. This
happens, e.g. when defining \_content at startup.

It's in

Our IsCrossTrustDomainCall() check was busted and made us think that we were
dealing with chrome calling content when content was calling itself. Silly
mistake. While I was at it I renamed the function to IsSystemCallingContent()
to keep things a bit more sane.

Attached patch

[keep eval and exec from being called across any trust domain boundary, v2](attachment.cgi?id=180435&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=180435&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=289074&attachment=180435)

This is much better than the kludge it obsoletes. It's still a pair of special
cases, but that's what we want for defense in depth: checks that seem redundant
but will save us if someone finds a way to sick eval or a Script object
somewhere that chrome will call.

For the record, the patches in this bug caused regression [bug 289949](/show_bug.cgi?id=289949 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash in aviary builds using Linkification extension - FF10X [@ js_GC][@ js_LinkFunctionObject]"), sporadic
crashes (thought to be related to the linkification extension). The problem was
missing mark management code when cloning xpconnect wrapped function objects.
See the bug and patch for details.

Asa: we haven't landed needed fixes from the branches on the trunk, and we have
not landed one patch on the branches that I've been developing in [bug 290324](/show_bug.cgi?id=290324 "RESOLVED FIXED - XULElement created by content can make chrome access non-DOM JS properties").
The approach used with this bug, [bug 290324](/show_bug.cgi?id=290324 "RESOLVED FIXED - XULElement created by content can make chrome access non-DOM JS properties"), and [bug 289083](/show_bug.cgi?id=289083 "RESOLVED FIXED - |new Script()| causes arbitrary code execution") needs to be
reevaluated before porting the several branch patches to the trunk.
I'd like to use [bug 281988](/show_bug.cgi?id=281988 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop sharing DOM object wrappers between content and chrome") to do that reevaluation and likely re-implementation.
It needs to get done for 1.8b2. This bug and [bug 289083](/show_bug.cgi?id=289083 "RESOLVED FIXED - |new Script()| causes arbitrary code execution") can be closed as far
as I am concerned, but it would be best to do that \*after\* we've fixed the trunk.

Is it too late?

Workaround: Disable Javascript
But, Disabling JavaScript is not a workaround for this bug and [bug 289083](/show_bug.cgi?id=289083 "RESOLVED FIXED - |new Script()| causes arbitrary code execution").
A page using XBL can exploit even though JavaScript is disabled.

instead of waiting for [bug 281988](/show_bug.cgi?id=281988 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop sharing DOM object wrappers between content and chrome") (which is nearly there anyway).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050319
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050319
Even though a |Script Object| is created by a web page, when it is called
from chrome JS, it is executed with chrome privilege.
If a web page redefines |localName getter| of a DOM node, such as following.
document.body.\_\_defineGetter\_\_("localName", function() {
return { toLowerCase : new Script("alert(Components.stack);") };
});
Then, if there is a code such as the following code in chrome JS,
"alert(Components.stack);" will be executed with chrome privilege.
local\_name = event.target.localName.toLowerCase();
In addition, |typeof new Script()| is "function" in Firefox1.0.2 and
Mozilla1.7.6 (it is "object" in latest-trunk), thus, it is easier to write a
exploit code, such as following.
document.body.\_\_defineGetter\_\_("localName", new
Script("alert(Components.stack);"));
And an attacker can exploit \*without\* user interaction, by using DOMLinkAdded Event.

In [bug 289074 comment 56](/show_bug.cgi?id=289074#c56 "RESOLVED FIXED - security hole in markLinkVisited (Bug 217195) has not been fixed"), moz\_bug\_r\_a4@yahoo.com wrote:
# And, if there is no real getter/setter, the user-defined getter/setter will
# be used. (Is this behavior benefited by unsafe\_gsfun? if so, already fixed.)
# Thus, the following code can exploit.
#
# // Body doesn't have |rel| property
# document.body.\_\_defineGetter\_\_("rel", function() {
# return { toString : new Script(code) };
# });
#
# var event = document.createEvent("Events");
# event.initEvent("DOMLinkAdded", true, true);
# document.body.dispatchEvent(event);
Testcase is [attachment 180192](/attachment.cgi?id=180192 "DOMLinkAdded Event from document.body") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=180192&action=edit "DOMLinkAdded Event from document.body").
The real fix for this is [bug 289940](/show_bug.cgi?id=289940 "VERIFIED FIXED - Chrome code needs to be protected from untrusted events.") (or [bug 281988](/show_bug.cgi?id=281988 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop sharing DOM object wrappers between content and chrome")). (Or perhaps also something
to caps -- I'm not sure why |new Script| can be used this way.) But I'll attach
a patch here to fix just this one case, as we've already done for a bunch of
other cases, since [bug 289940](/show_bug.cgi?id=289940 "VERIFIED FIXED - Chrome code needs to be protected from untrusted events.") is probably a bit much for 1.0.3.

dbaron, I patched the JS engine (not caps) to add extra defense in the way of a
rogue (content) eval or Script.prototype.exec that has somehow managed to run on
a chrome (actually, any different-principals-pointer-owning) scope. See [bug
289074](/show_bug.cgi?id=289074 "RESOLVED FIXED - security hole in markLinkVisited (Bug 217195) has not been fixed") [attachment 180435](/attachment.cgi?id=180435 "keep eval and exec from being called across any trust domain boundary, v2") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=180435&action=edit "keep eval and exec from being called across any trust domain boundary, v2") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=180435&action=diff "keep eval and exec from being called across any trust domain boundary, v2") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=289074&attachment=180435).
This \*could\* break a web app distributed across several sub-domains that uses
document.domain and runs otherWindow.eval, but I'll take that chance.

when I load the test case in today's build (200504120x-1.0.3 ffox in linux fc3

duh, to answer my own question: yes, looks fixed, since the exploit popup
doesn't appear. verified as fixed with 1.0.3 branch builds.

Has this landed on the trunk yet? Does it belong on the trunk? If so, can we
resolve it? If not, can we get it landed there?

# Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200504-18**

New Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Suite releases fix new security
vulnerabilities, including memory disclosure and various ways of executing
JavaScript code with elevated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.7** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.7** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that includes a
mail and news reader. Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation browser
from the Mozilla project.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla Suite
and Mozilla Firefox:

* Vladimir V. Perepelitsa reported a memory disclosure bug in
  JavaScript's regular expression string replacement when using an
  anonymous function as the replacement argument (CAN-2005-0989).
* moz\_bug\_r\_a4 discovered that Chrome UI code was overly trusting DOM
  nodes from the content window, allowing privilege escalation via DOM
  property overrides.
* Michael Krax reported a possibility to run JavaScript code with
  elevated privileges through the use of javascript: favicons.
* Michael Krax also discovered that malicious Search plugins could
  run JavaScript in the context of the displayed page or stealthily
  replace existing search plugins.
* shutdown discovered a technique to pollute the global scope of a
  window in a way that persists from page to page.
* Doron Rosenberg discovered a possibility to run JavaScript with
  elevated privileges when the user asks to "Show" a blocked popup that
  contains a JavaScript URL.
* Finally, Georgi Guninski reported missing Install object instance
  checks in the native implementations of XPInstall-related JavaScript
  objects.

The following Firefox-specific vulnerabilities have also been
discovered:

* Kohei Yoshino discovered a new way to abuse the sidebar panel to
  execute JavaScript with elevated privileges.
* Omar Khan reported that the Plugin Finder Service can be tricked to
  open javascript: URLs with elevated privileges.

### Impact

The various JavaScript execution with elevated privileges issues can be
exploited by a remote attacker to install malicious code or steal data.
The memory disclosure issue can be used to reveal potentially sensitive
information. Finally, the cache pollution issue and search plugin abuse
can be leveraged in cross-site-scripting attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.3"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.3"
```

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.7"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.7"
```
