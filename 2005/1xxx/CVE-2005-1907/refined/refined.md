Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2005-1907:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-1907

**Vulnerability:** Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000 Firewall vulnerability (SecureNAT).

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the SecureNAT component of Microsoft ISA Server 2000 Firewall. This component is responsible for translating private IP addresses to public ones, enabling clients in a private network to access the internet.
* **Weaknesses:**  The specific weakness is not detailed, but it is implied that the SecureNAT component improperly handles or validates certain network traffic, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.
* **Impact:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service on the ISA Server 2000. This would disrupt the network connectivity of all clients relying on that firewall, preventing them from accessing the internet or other external resources.
* **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through network traffic targeted towards the vulnerable ISA Server 2000 component. The specific type of traffic is not specified, but it is implied it needs to be crafted or manipulated.
* **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would require the ability to send network traffic to the ISA Server 2000. This could potentially be achieved from the internet or an internal network depending on the server's configuration.

The content includes two workarounds:
1.  Restricting access from clients by setting limitations to network traffic amount using ISA Server's Site and Content Rules Wizard feature or using 3rd party products.
2.  Ensuring that client computers are configured to use Windows Firewall or Internet Connection Firewall (ICF).
