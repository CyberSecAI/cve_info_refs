    {
      "cve": "CVE-2005-1051",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "PunBB 1.2.4 is vulnerable to SQL injection in the change_email functionality, allowing an attacker to escalate privileges to admin.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data when changing an email address. Specifically, the `req_new_email` parameter in the `profile.php?action=change_email` request is vulnerable.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
         "Insufficient Input Validation",
         "Lack of Sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a regular user to gain administrative privileges by manipulating the email address to inject SQL that modifies their group ID to '1', the admin group ID.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP Request",
        "SQL Injection via User-supplied data"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs a valid user account to log in to the forum.",
        "The attacker requires knowledge of the target forum's URL.",
        "The attacker also needs a catch-all email address that can be used to receive emails with SQL statements."
      ],
       "additional_info": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how to leverage this vulnerability by crafting a malicious email address containing SQL to modify the user's group ID."
