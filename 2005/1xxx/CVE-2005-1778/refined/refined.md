The provided content describes a critical SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in PostNuke version x=> 0.750.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The SQL injection vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `/modules/Messages/readpmsg.php` file. Specifically, the `$start` variable in the query is directly included in the SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The error message displays the unsanitized input, leading to XSS. The injected content is reflected back in the error message, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:**
    - An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially gain access to sensitive database information, including user credentials (usernames and passwords).
    - The attacker can modify database records, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized access to the system.
- **Cross-site Scripting:**
    - An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the error message, leading to arbitrary code execution in a victim's browser.
    - This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, and potentially more damaging attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `start` parameter in the URL to inject SQL queries. For example, injecting `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data from other tables in the database
- **Cross-site Scripting:** By injecting HTML or JavaScript into the `start` parameter, which will then be reflected in the error message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable PostNuke instance
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the injection is triggered when accessing `readpmsg.php`.
- The attacker needs to craft malicious SQL or Javascript payloads.
