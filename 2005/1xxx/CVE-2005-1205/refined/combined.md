## Telnet Client Information Disclosure Vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#800829

Original Release Date: 2005-06-14 | Last Revised: 2005-07-28

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the handling of the NEW-ENVIRON command allows a malicious telnet server to gain information from a client's environment variables.

### Description

| The Telnet network protocol is described in [RFC854](http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc854.html) and [RFC855](http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc855.html) as a general, bi-directional communications facility. The Telnet protocol is commonly used for command-line login sessions between Internet hosts.  The vulnerability is in the NEW-ENVIRON sub-command that is the mechanism to used for passing environment information between a telnet client and server. Use of this mechanism enables a telnet user to propagate configuration information to a remote host when connecting. Please see [RFC1572](http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1572.html) for more information. As specified in section 3 of RFC1572 the expected default behavior should be "that there will not be any exchange of environment information".In order to exploit this vulnerability, a malicious server can send a connected client the following telnet command:SB NEW-ENVIRON SEND ENV\_USERVAR <name of environment variable> SEVulnerable telnet clients will send the value of the referenced environment variable. Environment variables may contain a variety of the information such as local username, executable file search paths, locations of sensitive data, and other potentially sensitive information about the client computer.Please note telnet functionality has been embedded in many applications and not just underlying operating systems distributions.The [iDefense Security Advisory](http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=260) contains additional information about affected and unaffected vendors. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to gather information about remote systems and users who connect to attackers malicious telnet server. An attacker would have to trick a victim into initiating a telnet connection using a vulnerable client. This may be accomplished with an HTML rendered email or web page, using the TELNET:// URI handler, however further user interaction may be required. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update from your vendor**  Patches, updates, and fixes should be available from multiple vendors. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Disable access to telnet, limit the use of telnet to trusted sites and/or encourage the use more secure remote connection clients.On Unix systems it might be viable to remove execute permission from telnet and other binaries that perform telnet.On Windows systems changing or removing the registry key entry: HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\telnet\shell\open\commandshould reduce the likelihood of successful automatic exploitation attempts such as those using telnet URLs. Note these workarounds do not address the underlying vulnerability. |

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why has Microsoft reissued this bulletin?**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the vulnerability addressed also affects Windows Services for Unix 2.0 and Windows Services for Unix 2.1. Microsoft has updated the bulletin with additional information about these security updates. Customers who are not using Windows Services for Unix 2.0 or Windows Services for UNIX 2.1 and have previously installed the security updates provided as part of the original release of this bulletin do not need to install the new security update.

**Does this update contain any other changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in each âVulnerability Detailsâ sections of this bulletin, this update includes the following change in functionality: A new registry key was added to allow customers to specify additional environment variables that the telnet client can disclose. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 900934](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/900934)

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 ended on June 30, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a ended on December 31, 2004. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 have reached the end of their life cycles. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT 4.0 SP6a must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine whether this update is required, but only for programs that MBSA supports. For example, MBSA does not support Windows Services for UNIX and will not detect whether the update is required for that program. However, Microsoft has developed a version of the [Enterprise Update Scanning Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) (EST) that will help customers determine if the Windows Services for UNIX security update is required. For detailed information about the programs that MBSA currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, [detailed documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you have to apply the Windows Services for UNIX updates. For more information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). For more detailed deployment information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894192). There is also a version of this tool that SMS customers can obtain by visiting the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154). This tool may also be available for SMS customers from the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect. However, there is a version of the EST that SMS customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators. To download this version of the EST, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894194). The Security Update Inventory Tool is required for detecting Microsoft Windows and other affected Microsoft products. For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460)

## Vulnerability Details

#### Telnet Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1205:

An attacker who successfully exploited this information disclosure vulnerability could remotely read the session variables for users who have open connections to a malicious telnet server.

#### Mitigating Factors for Telnet Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1205:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could only read the session variables for the affected user. This does not include critical data such as password hashes.
* All versions of Windows Services for UNIX are vulnerable to this issue only when they are running on Windows 2000. When Windows Services for UNIX is running on other operating systems, it is not vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for Telnet Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1205:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Un-register the default Telnet client:**
  To help prevent attacks that use Telnet URLs, you can remove the Telnet, Tn3270, and Rlogin handlers. This will prevent Internet Explorer and other applications from automatically launching Telnet sessions.

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedt32**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. In Registry Editor, delete the following registry keys:

     HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\telnet\shell\open\command

     HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\tn3270\shell\open\command

     HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\rlogin\shell\open\command

  **Impact of Workaround:** These changes will help prevent attacks by blocking Telnet from being used to process Telnet, Tn3270, or Rlogin URLs.

#### FAQ for Telnet Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1205:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely read the session variables of users who have open connections to a malicious telnet server. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly. It could be used to produce useful information to try to further compromise the affected system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Telnet client was designed to provide this kind of information.

**What is Telnet?**

[Telnet](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0854.txt) is an industry standard protocol that allows a user to establish a remote terminal session on a telnet server. Because this is a terminal session, there is only a command-line interface. Telnet is mainly used for simple remote administration at a command prompt. This is a separate application than Microsoft HyperTerminal. Microsoft HyperTerminal is not affected by this issue.

**What is Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX?**

[Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/interopmigration/unix/sfu/default.mspx) is a product that allows customers to run UNIX application on a Windows system. Providing this capability expands support for UNIX applications, daemons, and scripts by providing an enhanced UNIX environmental subsystem beyond the standard POSIX subsystem. Windows Service for UNIX allows customers to run UNIX applications, daemons, and scripts.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely read the session variables for users who have open connections to a malicious telnet server.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are several different ways that an attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in every case. Here are some examples:

* An attacker could host a malicious Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site.
* An attacker could also create an e-mail message that has a specially crafted Telnet URL. An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability by persuading the user to view or to preview an e-mail message than contains a Telnet URL and then persuade the user to then click the Telnet URL.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk from this vulnerability. However, an attacker would have to combine this issue with another vulnerability for a system to be at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by restricting the session variables that Telnet sends to a Telnet server. [Internet RFC 1572](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1572.txt) defines a set of âwell knownâ variables that the updated Telnet client allows to be requested. This updated Telnet client also continues to allow the use of the SFUTLNTVER and SFUTLNTMODE variables because they are used by Windows Services for UNIX Telnet servers. All other session variables are restricted.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyze, Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
