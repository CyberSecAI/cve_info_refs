The provided content relates to CVE-2005-1053.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ModernBill order forms are vulnerable to multiple XSS issues due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** A script `news.php` within the `samples` directory is vulnerable to RFI due to an include statement that uses a user-controlled parameter `DIR`. This allows an attacker to include a remote file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **XSS:** Inadequate input validation allows injection of malicious scripts into web pages.
*   **RFI:** The `news.php` script allows the inclusion of arbitrary remote files due to lack of input validation and improper handling of the `DIR` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Could be used to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or render hostile code in a victim's browser.
*   **RFI:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected web server by including a malicious PHP file.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **XSS:**  By crafting malicious URLs with embedded JavaScript and sending them to the victim, or by enticing a user to visit a page controlled by the attacker which uses the vulnerable URL parameters.
*   **RFI:** By sending a crafted URL with a malicious URL as the `DIR` parameter to the vulnerable `news.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to entice the victim to click the crafted URL, or visit a website controlled by the attacker which includes the malicious URL parameters.
*   **RFI:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious PHP file on a publicly accessible server. The attacker also needs to be able to send the crafted URL to the vulnerable `news.php` script.

**Additional Details (from marc.info content):**

*   The vulnerable file `news.php` is located in the `samples` directory.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `include_once($DIR."include/functions.inc.php");` statement in `news.php` where `$DIR` is user-controlled.
*   The attacker's malicious PHP file will not be parsed before being included as long as PHP is not enabled at the malicious hosting server.
*   The vendor is identified as ModernGigabyte, LLC.
*   The specific vulnerable versions are ModernBill 4.3.0 and earlier.
*   A fix for these issues is available. Users are advised to upgrade immediately.
