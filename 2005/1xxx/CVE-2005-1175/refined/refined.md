      "root_cause": "A single-byte heap buffer overflow occurs in the `krb5_unparse_name()` function when it is called with a principal name having zero components.",

      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted Kerberos request via TCP or UDP to a KDC or application server.  The attacker needs to control a realm that shares a cross-realm key with the target realm, which allows the attacker to use a cross-realm ticket for a zero-component client principal name.",
