The provided content details multiple Full Path Disclosure vulnerabilities in php-Nuke 7.6 and below.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities stem from errors in various PHP files, particularly within language files. These errors lead to PHP parse errors, which, in turn, reveal the full server path of the affected files when the application attempts to load them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Full Path Disclosure:**  The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the server's file system paths due to PHP parse errors.
*   **Incorrect Language File Syntax:** The errors occur due to incorrect syntax in the language files. This is shown in the examples with unexpected T_STRING on certain lines. This is causing parse errors.
*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The application fails to properly handle these parse errors. Instead of gracefully failing, it displays the error message, which includes the full file path.
*   **Database Connection Issues:** Two vulnerabilities were found with the database connection, which were identified as non-objects and non-existent classes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the server's internal directory structure, making targeted attacks easier.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Knowledge of the file paths might aid attackers in identifying other vulnerabilities or configuration issues.
*   **Application Instability:** The errors found may cause application issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerabilities by accessing specific modules with vulnerable language settings, via the `newlang` parameter in the URL. For example, `modules.php?name=Reviews&newlang=norwegian`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker needs no special privileges to exploit the vulnerability. 
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server in order to send a request to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable URL parameters:** The attacker needs to know what URL parameters to change to trigger the path disclosure.

**Vulnerable Files Identified:**
*   `includes/ipban.php`
*   `db/db.php`
*   `/modules/Reviews/language/lang-norwegian.php`
*   `/modules/Downloads/language/lang-greek.php`
*   `/modules/Downloads/language/lang-indonesian.php`
*   `/modules/Web_Links/language/lang-portuguese.php`
*  `/modules/Web_Links/language/lang-indonesian.php`
*  `/modules/Surveys/language/lang-indonesian.php`
*  `/modules/Reviews/language/lang-portuguese.php`
*  `/modules/Journal/language/lang-portuguese.php`
