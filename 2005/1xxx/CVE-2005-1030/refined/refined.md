The provided content relates to CVE-2005-1030.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Active Auction House application suffers from multiple SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities were found in various parameters and pages (`catid`, `Sortby`, `itemID`, email field in `sendpassword.asp`). These vulnerabilities are caused by directly incorporating user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper escaping or sanitization.
- XSS: Several XSS vulnerabilities exist in various parameters (`ReturnURL`, `Title`, `itemid`). These occur due to the application echoing user-supplied data into the HTML output without proper encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL Injection: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- XSS: An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- SQL Injection: By injecting malicious SQL code into vulnerable parameters within the application's URLs.
- XSS: By injecting malicious JavaScript code into vulnerable parameters within the application's URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the application. No specific privileges are required, and the attacks can be initiated remotely.
