Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-1496 (based on the content)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `DBMS_SCHEDULER` package in Oracle 10g. Specifically, when a database job is executed using `DBMS_SCHEDULER.run_job`, the `SESSION_USER` is incorrectly switched to `SYS` instead of maintaining the user that initiated the job.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect `SESSION_USER` Handling:** The core issue is the improper switching of the `SESSION_USER` context when executing jobs scheduled via `DBMS_SCHEDULER`. It changes from the user who created/runs the job to `SYS`.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Because `SESSION_USER` is used in conjunction with VPD and OLS, switching the context to `SYS` can bypass these security mechanisms and allow unauthorized access and operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with `CREATE JOB` privilege can effectively gain `SYS` privileges within a session by running a job using `DBMS_SCHEDULER`.
- **Bypassing Security Mechanisms:** The switch to the `SYS` context allows an attacker to bypass VPD and OLS restrictions, potentially accessing data or performing actions they are normally not authorized to do.
- **Data Breaches and Data Manipulation:** By bypassing security restrictions an attacker can potentially access and manipulate sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user with `CREATE JOB` privilege can craft and execute a job using `dbms_scheduler.run_job`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account in the Oracle database with the `CREATE JOB` privilege.
- The attacker must be able to connect to the database and execute SQL commands.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially disclosed on the Oracle Metalink forum but was later removed by Oracle.
- Oracle released a patch for this issue with the October 2005 Critical Patch Update (CPU). Patchset 10.1.0.4 also fixes the issue.
- The `CURRENT_USER` context does show the user that initiated the job.
- Red-Database-Security GmbH also published an exploit for this vulnerability.
