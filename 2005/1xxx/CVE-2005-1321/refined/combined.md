The Horde Team is pleased to announce the official release of the Vacation
Auto Responder Manager version 2.2.2.

Vacation is a Horde module for managing user e-mail "vacation notices" or
"auto-responders." It works via a local vacation program which must be
installed and functioning on the server. It supports vacation programs using
the .forward-style forwarding mechanism supported by several popular mailers,
as well as qmail and sql based implementations.

Changes in this release:
    * Fixed an XSS vulnerability.
    * Fixed VFS support in qmail driver.
    * Added Polish translation.
    * Updated German translation.
