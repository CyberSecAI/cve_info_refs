{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Gamespy CD-key validation system allows an attacker to capture authorization requests sent by a legitimate game server to the Gamespy master server. These captured requests can then be replayed by the attacker, causing the master server to believe that the CD-key is in use by the attacker's server. This prevents the legitimate owner of the CD-key from joining any online game server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Replay attack vulnerability due to lack of proper session management or request validation.",
      "The master server does not properly verify the authenticity or freshness of authorization requests.",
        "The game server, client and master server communicate without proper mechanisms to prevent replay attacks."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service, preventing legitimate players from playing online. The valid cd-key is blocked for use.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack: Sniffing authorization requests between a legitimate game server and the Gamespy master server.",
      "Malicious server: Deploying a game server modified to always report that the player is playing and never sending the disconnect command."
        ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
       "Ability to operate a game server accessible through the internet.",
        "Ability to capture network traffic.",
       "Ability to modify game server executables (for one of the described attack vectors)"
    ],
        "additional_details": "The attacker does not need to know the cd-key to perform this attack, as the cd-key is never sent in plain text but rather a series of random strings and hashes. The attacker only needs to capture the authorization requests sent from game servers to the master server. There are two methods to perform this attack: 1) Modifying a game server to always report the player is playing, and never send the disc/disconnect command, and replay the packets. 2) Capturing the packets using a sniffer, then using an application to send the captured requests to the master server, then reporting to the master server that the player is still connected."
