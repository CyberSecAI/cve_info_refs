Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `set_lang.php` file of phpMyVisites 1.3. The script uses a user-supplied value from the `mylang` POST parameter, stored in a cookie and used in an include statement without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI). The script includes a file based on the `$lang['default_lang']` variable, which is derived directly from the user-controlled cookie value without proper validation.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `$_POST['mylang']` value is directly used to set the cookie and then used in an include statement without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local File Retrieval:** An attacker can read any local files on the web server that the webserver user has access to. This can include sensitive configuration files, database credentials, source code, and other potentially confidential information.
- **Possible further exploitation:** Depending on the included file, it could allow for further exploitation using Remote Code Execution (RCE) techniques using uploaded files or other known methods.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts an HTTP POST request to the `login.php` script of phpMyVisites.
- **'mylang' Parameter Manipulation:** The POST request includes a `mylang` parameter whose value is set to the path of the file to be included.
- **Cookie Manipulation:** This value is used to set a cookie that is read by the vulnerable script and then included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the phpMyVisites installation.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know the path to the phpMyVisites `login.php` script and its functionality.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional details:**
The provided content gives an explicit exploit example using HTML forms and clarifies how the cookie is set using `$_POST['mylang']` which was not described in the CVE description. The vulnerability exists in `include/set_lang.php` on line 94 using a `$_COOKIE[$nomcookielg]` that is set on line 66 after the `$_POST['mylang']` is used to set a cookie on line 40.
