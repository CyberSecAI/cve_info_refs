> Microsoft has addressed your issues 1-a, 1-b and 1-c by adding a
> property "ViewStateUserKey" to the System.Web.UI.Page class in
> .NET Framework 1.1.  The documentation for this property is here:

No, I think this statement is simply not true. The key is intended to
solve a wholly different class of problems, and has nothing to do with
replay attacks I reported.

Reported issue 1-a: same user moves __VIEWSTATE from one page to
another. Adding unique user identifier to __VIEWSTATE does not help,
because in both cases, it's precisely the same user within the same
system.

Reported issue 1-b: same user retains __VIEWSTATE and reuses it at a
later date. Again, it's precisely the same person and the same unique
ID.

Reported issue 1-c: this is the least relevant of all reported
problems, and indeed can be in some situations mitigated by binding
__VIEWSTATE data to a specific user.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Download RAW [message](?l=bugtraq&m=111513127704270&q=mbox) or [body](?l=bugtraq&m=111513127704270&q=raw)]

Good morning,

ASP.NET's extremely popular __VIEWSTATE functionality provides an automatic,
uniform method for storing current state of all webpage "controls" (including
form fields, database views, etc), so that user-entered data automagically
persists and is populated across newly rendered HTML, and so that current
selections of displayed database records are cached and do not need to be
looked up again after every operation.

The data is by *typically* stored on client side as base64-encoded, hidden
POST form field. By default, the field is protected from tampering by being
"signed" using SHA1 with machine-specific key and - although not discussed by
Microsoft - presumably either target .aspx filename or other file ID parameter.

Because information from controls such as DataGrid is by default "cached" in
__VIEWSTATE, enabling the user to tamper with this data would allow for
modifying item ID and price data in ASP.NET online shops, for example. This
possibility is discussed by Microsoft and others, with the conclusion that
SHA1/MD5 signing prevents it, and hence it is safe to rely on __VIEWSTATE
cached data in that regard:

  <http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/viewstate.asp>

Storing and then trusting database fields retrieved from user, even with
SHA1 validation, may send shivers down any infosec guy's or gal's spine,
but that's the way it'd seem to be done:

  "DataGrid stores its contents in the view state so the page developer
  doesn't need to rebind the database data to the DataGrid on each and
  every page load, but only on the first one. The benefit is that the
  database doesn't need to be accessed as often. "

Lacking proper documentation of __VIEWSTATE validation, and based
on my limited testing, I see two major problems with how the mechanism
is designed:

  1) Injection-through-replay scenarios are still available.

     "Signed" __VIEWSTATE is replayable for the system or cluster that
     generated it, for that specific .aspx script:

     a) The attacker may submit __VIEWSTATE acquired from one view, to a
        wholly different view with a reasonably compatible layout of cached
        controls.

        For example, if a provider of online shopping solutions hosts two
        distinct shops on a shared scripting platform - one shop with pet
        supplies, and one with expensive watches - and both (within their
        distinct databases or tables) happen to have item ID 123 - one for
        $19.99 (Acme brand cat food), another for $1999.00 (Rolex), the
        attacker may move __VIEWSTATE from buystuff.aspx?shop=catfood to
        buystuff.aspx?shop=watches, and place an order item ID 123 for
        $19.99.

     b) Since there appears to be no expiration mechanism, user may keep
        __VIEWSTATE data and reuse it after availability, pricing, or other
        parameters of items or settings has changed, or ability to access
        certain information has been restricted, effectively obtaining
        a "backdoor" of sorts.

     c) The attacker may obtain __VIEWSTATE after entering dangerous or
        offensive contents or view settings within his session (some of which
        may be not immediately visible), then redirect third parties through
        a webpage with a specific __VIEWSTATE parameter to expose them to that
        contents, or to impose these settings upon that viewer.

  2) When NOT signed, resource starvation due to __VIEWSTATE complexity is
     possible.

     The format of the base64-encoded data is often summarised as "compressed
     XML"; __VIEWSTATE uses a simplistic, hierarchical markup scheme: first
     letter decides record type (triplet, pair, one of primitive types such
     as strings or integers); values for that record are enclosed in <...>
     that immediately follows that letter; fields of a record are separated by
     ';'; records can be nested with no limits.

     The problem: __VIEWSTATE is sometimes used with no integrity protection
     for valid reasons. If only user input fields are going to be cached,
     there is no immediate problem with effects of __VIEWSTATE tampering
     (with the possible exception of 1c), and performance benefits of avoiding
     SHA1 are noticable.

     Unfortunately, because of its hierarchical structure, and parsing based
     on recursive function calls, it is trivial to consume excessive amounts
     of resources by constructing a very deeply nested structure. Consider
     this unix shell example:

     perl -e '{print "t<" x 8000, ";;>" x 8000}' | \
       mimencode | awk '{printf "%s", $0}'

     Inserting the output of that sequence in place of __VIEWSTATE form field
     value in a page then submitted to a webserver that has SHA1 integrity
     checking disabled will consume excessive resources on the target machine
     (in some cases, omitting the closing ";;>" sequence offers even better
     effort-gain DoS ratio).

Possible mitigation method for problem #1: include secure session ID within
__VIEWSTATE data, correlate with existing session control data, or validate
and expire appropriately; or sacrifice storage and keep this data on server.

Mitigation method for problem #2: sacrifice CPU cycles to always validate
data; or store on server.
