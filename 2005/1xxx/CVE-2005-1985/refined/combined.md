How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately-reported vulnerability. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Client Service for NetWare (CSNW). By default, CSNW is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually installed CSNW could be vulnerable to this issue. The vulnerability is documented in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin. This service is also called Gateway Service for NetWare on Windows 2000 Server.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 | Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client Service for NetWare Vulnerability - [CAN-2005-1985](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2005-1985) | Remote Code Execution | Important | Important | Important | Important |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why will Windows Update and Microsoft Update offer this security update, and MBSA recommend this update, even if the affected services are not installed?**

In some cases the affected files that support the affected services exist by default as part of the operating system. Even if these files are present, the system is not vulnerable to this issue unless the affected services are installed. However, since these services could be enabled in the future based on the files that are already copied to the local system, Windows Update and Microsoft Update will offer this security update to these systems and MBSA will determine that these systems require the security update. This will allow SMS to deploy these security update to clients that may contain this vulnerability should the affected services be installed in the future. **Note** This does not apply to Windows XP Home Edition. Windows XP Home Edition does not contain the vulnerable component.

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 ended on June 30, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a ended on December 31, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 have reached the end of their life cycles. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require additional custom support for these products must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 1.2.1 to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA 1.2.1 will determine whether this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 2.0 to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA 2.0 will determine whether this update is required. MBSA 2.0 can detect security updates for products that Microsoft Update supports. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158). The Security Update Inventory Tool can be used by SMS for detecting security updates that are offered by [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130), that are supported by [Software Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133), and other security updates that are supported by MBSA 1.2.1. For more information about the Security Update Inventory Tool, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/2003/featurepacks/suspack). For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). The SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates can be used by SMS for detecting security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50757).

#### Mitigating Factors for Client Service for NetWare Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1985:

* Windows XP Home Edition is not vulnerable to this issue. Windows XP Home Edition does not contain the vulnerable component.
* By default, the Client Service for NetWare is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually install this service are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
* If CSNW is manually installed on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, an attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users on this operating system version.
* For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for Client Service for NetWare Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1985:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Note** CSNW is commonly associated with the Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) protocols. However, CSNW could be exploited by using any installed protocol. Because TCP/IP is the most commonly used protocol, the following workarounds are based on TCP/IP. If protocols such as IPX and SPX are being used, you should also block the appropriate ports for those protocols. For more information about IPX and SPX, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/reskit/prch_cnn_goue.asp).

* **Remove the Client Service for NetWare if you do not need it.**

  If you no longer need the Client Service for NetWare, remove it. To do this, follow these steps. These steps apply only to Windows XP. For other operating system versions, follow the procedure that is included in the product documentation.

  1. Open Network Connections.
  2. Right-click a local area connection, and then click **Properties**.
  3. In the **This connection uses the following items** list, click **Client Service for NetWare**.
  4. Click the **General** tab, and then click **Uninstall**.
  5. Complete the removal by following the instructions on the screen.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Some organizations require the affected component for important functions. Administrators should not remove the affected component unless they fully understand the effect that doing this will have on their environment.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall:**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking them at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet. In Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003, this features is called the Windows Firewall.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

     To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:
  3. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  4. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  5. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  6. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  7. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

     **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB899589\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 899589 security update into the Windows installation source files.
