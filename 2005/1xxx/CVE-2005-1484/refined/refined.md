Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Golden FTP Server Pro v2.52 does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths when handling file access requests. This allows users to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `\../`) to navigate outside the intended FTP root directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the FTP root and access files and directories on the server's file system using `..` sequences.
*   **Path Disclosure:** When requesting a non-existent file, the server reveals the shared path by prepending the FTP root to the requested path in the error message, leaking the real file path on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can read sensitive files located outside the intended FTP share, potentially including system files.
*  **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability exposes the server's internal directory structure by revealing the location of the FTP root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the FTP protocol by using specially crafted `GET` commands including directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server.
*   The attacker requires knowledge of the file system structure of the server to effectively use directory traversal.
*   The attacker needs to know the path of a shared folder to start the traversal from, as traversal outside of that folder won't work directly.
