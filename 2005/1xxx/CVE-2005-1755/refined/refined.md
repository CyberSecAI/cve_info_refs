Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE-2005-1755** is related to a PHP injection vulnerability in PHP Poll Creator v1.01.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure inclusion of files in `poll_vote.php`. The script uses a user-supplied variable `$relativer_pfad` via URL GET parameter to include files such as `config.inc.php` and `functions.inc.php`. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `$relativer_pfad` variable to include arbitrary PHP files from an attacker-controlled location.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unsanitized Input:** The script does not properly sanitize or validate the `$relativer_pfad` parameter received from the URL.
    *   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** By manipulating the `$relativer_pfad`, an attacker can force the script to include a malicious PHP file from an external server, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious PHP code into the application and execute it on the server.
    *   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful code execution could lead to unauthorized access to the server, data breaches, or full control over the compromised system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker can inject the malicious code by crafting a URL with the `relativer_pfad` parameter pointing to their PHP file.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the `relativer_pfad` parameter and its role in the file inclusion process.
    *   **Hosting Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have a server to host the malicious PHP file they want to include.

**Additional Details (from marc.info content):**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `poll_vote.php` file.
*   The variable `$relativer_pfad` is passed via the URL, making it easily accessible to attackers.
*   An example URL to exploit this vulnerability is provided, illustrating how to specify the attacker-controlled file location.
*   The advisory notes that the software is no longer under active development, suggesting there won't be an official patch.
