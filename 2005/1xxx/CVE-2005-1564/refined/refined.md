Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Information Leak Through Product Name Guessing**

*   **Root Cause:** The `CanEnterProduct()` function in Bugzilla versions 2.10 through 2.18, 2.19.1, and 2.19.2, does not properly check if a user has permission to view a product before informing them that they cannot enter a bug against it.
*   **Weakness:** Inadequate access control checks in `CanEnterProduct()` allows an unprivileged user to guess a product name, and Bugzilla will respond with a specific message that confirms the existence of that product. This reveals the presence of hidden products. Additionally, it was possible to enter bugs into products closed for entry by guessing the product name.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can enumerate the existence of hidden products and enter bugs in closed products, revealing potential product or component names.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  By attempting to create a bug for various product names, an attacker can iteratively determine which products exist, even if they are intended to be hidden. Also, a user could create a bug by hacking the URL given to `post_bug.cgi`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a user of the Bugzilla system, and have the ability to send HTTP requests with modified parameters.

**Vulnerability 2: User Password Exposure in Report URLs**

*   **Root Cause:** Bugzilla versions 2.17.1 through 2.18, 2.19.1, and 2.19.2 sometimes include a user's username and password in the URL when generating a report.
*   **Weakness:** The user's credentials are embedded in the URL when prompted to log in while generating a report.
*   **Impact:** Usernames and passwords can be exposed in web server logs or browser history.
*  **Attack Vectors:** When a user is prompted to log in while attempting to view a chart/report, the credentials are included in the URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker with access to web server logs or a user's browser history could obtain the user's credentials.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The advisory and bug report provide detailed discussions and code-level fixes for the vulnerabilities.
*   The initial report of the first vulnerability stemmed from the fact that `CanEnterProduct()` did not check the 'disallownew' bit for products that are closed for bug entry.
*   The fix for the first vulnerability involved creating a `CanEnterProductOrWarn()` function that returns specific error messages based on the user's access level, product status ('disallownew'), and if the product has any components. This addresses the information leak by providing a more general error message when a user does not have access.
*   Multiple patches were created and reviewed to address issues in different Bugzilla versions (2.16, 2.18, and trunk).
*   The provided information is more detailed than the standard CVE description, including specific code changes, discussions, and testing results.
