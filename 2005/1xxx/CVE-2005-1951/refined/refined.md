Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the `tep_redirect()` function within osCommerce. Specifically, the application fails to properly handle Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters (`\r` and `\n` or `%0d` and `%0a` when URL encoded) in the URL parameters used for redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** The primary vulnerability is HTTP response splitting, also known as HTTP header injection. By injecting CRLF sequences into the URL, an attacker can manipulate the HTTP response headers. This allows them to insert arbitrary headers and even body content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stealing Sensitive Information:** An attacker could inject malicious headers to potentially steal user cookies or session identifiers.
*   **Web Site Defacement:** By injecting crafted headers and content, attackers could potentially alter the appearance of the web page or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Other Malicious Activities:** The ability to control HTTP response headers can be leveraged for various other attacks such as cache poisoning.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited through several parameters in osCommerce, including:
    *   `products_id` parameter with the `buy_now` action in `index.php`.
    *   `pid` parameter with the `cust_order` action in `index.php`.
    *   `goto` parameter with the `url` action in `banner.php`.
*   Attackers craft URLs with injected CRLF sequences within the vulnerable parameters. For example:
    *   `/index.php?action=buy_now&products_id=22%0d%0aSomeHeader:%20injectedValue`
    *   `/index.php?action=cust_order&pid=2%0d%0aSomeHeader:%20injectedValue`
    *   `/banner.php?action=url&goto=http://example.com%0d%0aSomeHeader:%20injectedValue`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any special privileges, however, for the `cust_order` example, the user must be logged in.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable osCommerce web application.
*   Knowledge of osCommerce's vulnerable parameters and scripts is required.

**Additional Details**
* The provided content includes a fix for the vulnerability by sanitizing the input with the following code ` $url = eregi_replace("[\r\n]+(.*)$", "", $url);`
