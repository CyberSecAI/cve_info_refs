# Cacti: Several vulnerabilities — GLSA **200506-20**

Cacti is vulnerable to several SQL injection, authentication bypass and
file inclusion vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/cacti** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6f** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6f** |

### Background

Cacti is a complete web-based frontend to rrdtool.

### Description

Cacti fails to properly sanitize input which can lead to SQL injection,
authentication bypass as well as PHP file inclusion.

### Impact

An attacker could potentially exploit the file inclusion to execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the web server. An attacker
could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication or inject
SQL queries to gain information from the database. Only systems with
register\_globals set to "On" are affected by the file inclusion and
authentication bypass vulnerabilities. Gentoo Linux ships with
register\_globals set to "Off" by default.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Cacti users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/cacti-0.8.6f"
```

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Lance Albertson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-15 19:39:27 UTC  ``` I recently got in contact with the authors of cacti, so I'm the first gentoo person to see this. Got an email from this not too long ago:  ----  Recently the Cacti group had been informed of some serious security  issues that would allow for SQL injection and global php variable  overwriting.  To resolve these issues, we have new release of Cacti  0.8.6e, which includes the security fixes and some minor bug fixes.  We will be announcing the new release of Cacti 0.8.6e on Monday June 20th.  You can find Cacti 0.8.6e at  <http://www.cacti.net/downloads/cacti-0.8.6e.tar.gz>, which is the  standard download location.  We hope this will at least be enough time to get the ball rolling for  updating related packages in distributions.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  Thanks,  The Cacti Group  Tony Roman Cacti Developer  ----  Not sure if they want this kind of quiet till the official release, so I'll mark this only visible for security folks. (I noticed they put it on vendor-disclosure). ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-15 22:10:10 UTC  ``` Adding individual maintainers as aliases don't work on restricted bugs.     Eldad/Aaron please attach an updated ebuild to this bug, do NOT commit  anything.        ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Lance Albertson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-15 22:56:18 UTC  ``` FYI, I talked with solar about this and he already just bumped an ebuild in portage (but its masked -*). No mention of why its there was included. I emailed the author to see how quiet he wants this since he was a bit vague on that in the email. I've already upgraded my personal setup at home on x86 and seems to be working fine.   Sorry that I didn't include individual folks, I knew I forgot something :-)  I'll keep you upprised of any more info from upstream. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-16 10:01:42 UTC  ``` Please test and report back success on this bug. Do NOT mark stable. Since it  is marked -* I've also called unstable arches.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Lance Albertson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-16 18:01:27 UTC  ``` FYI: If you tried testing this ebuild before this comment, please try again. The author just sent an email stating the tarball has changed with one more minor bug fix. I just updated the digest for it and should hit the rsync mirrors in 30-45min. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Simon Stelling (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-18 13:36:38 UTC  ``` works fine on amd64 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Michael Hanselmann (hansmi) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-18 14:18:59 UTC  ``` Works on ppc. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-18 17:10:38 UTC  ``` Alpha works. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-20 08:23:59 UTC  ``` sparc good. Sorry for the delay on this one. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Lance Albertson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-20 08:38:47 UTC  ``` Let me find out from the cacti authors when we can officially mark this stable and release an announcement. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Lance Albertson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-20 10:56:02 UTC  ``` Looks like it won't be posted till later tonight:  --- I still have a few announcements to type up, so hopefully not after 8:00 PM EDT. Either way, keep your eyes on the website for the official announcement before posting the distribution advisories.

Debian Bug     : 316590 315703

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in cacti, a round-robin
database (RRD) tool that helps create graphs from database
information.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project
identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-1524

    Maciej Piotr Falkiewicz and an anonymous researcher discovered an
    input validation bug that allows an attacker to include arbitrary
    PHP code from remote sites which will allow the execution of
    arbitrary code on the server running cacti.

CAN-2005-1525

    Due to mising input validation cacti allows a remote attacker to
    insert arbitrary SQL statements.

CAN-2005-1526

    Maciej Piotr Falkiewicz discovered an input validation bug that
    allows an attacker to include arbitrary PHP code from remote sites
    which will allow the execution of arbitrary code on the server
    running cacti.

CAN-2005-2148

    Stefan Esser discovered that the update for the abovely mentioned
    vulnerabilities does not perform proper input validation to
    protect against common attacks.

CAN-2005-2149

    Stefan Esser discovered that the update for CAN-2005-1525 allows
    remote attackers to modify session information to gain privileges
    and disable the use of addslashes to protect against SQL
    injection.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.7-2.5.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6c-7sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6e-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your cacti package.

Upgrade Instructions
