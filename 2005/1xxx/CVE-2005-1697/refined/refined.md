The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PostNuke 0.760 {RC2, RC3}, specifically within the RSS module.

**1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `rss_url` and `url` parameters of `magpie_slashbox.php`, `magpie_simple.php`, and `magpie_debug.php` scripts, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The RSS module scripts are vulnerable to reflected XSS.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By crafting malicious URLs with XSS payloads within the `rss_url` or `url` parameters and tricking a user into accessing them.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and trick a user into visiting these URLs, typically through phishing or other social engineering methods.

**2. Full Path Disclosure Vulnerability:**
*   **Root Cause:** The `simple_smarty.php` script attempts to include the `Smarty.class.php` file using a hardcoded, absolute path that may not be valid on the target system, resulting in a PHP warning and fatal error that reveals the full path of the server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insecure file inclusion path configuration.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can gather information about the server's file system structure and software installation paths. While not directly exploitable, this information can be helpful for further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Accessing the `simple_smarty.php` script directly through the web browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker only needs to be able to make web requests to the affected server.
