Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Warrior Kings and Warrior Kings: Battles:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability (Warrior Kings and Warrior Kings: Battles):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The game uses a vulnerable function to display text on the screen, which is susceptible to format string attacks.
    *   **Weakness:** The program does not properly sanitize user-provided input (specifically, nicknames) before using it in a format string function.
    *  **Impact:** Allows an attacker to potentially read from or write to arbitrary memory locations. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a malformed nickname to the game server.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to set a custom nickname, usually during the game joining or lobby phase. The server being locked prevents the exploitation.
*   **Crash Vulnerability (Warrior Kings: Battles only):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A partial join packet can lead to the server accessing a NULL pointer.
    *   **Weakness:** Incomplete or invalid join packets are not handled properly, leading to a null pointer dereference.
    *   **Impact:** Server crashes, leading to denial of service (DoS) for other players.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specifically crafted partial join packet to the game server.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the server.

**Summary:**

The content describes two distinct vulnerabilities. The first one is a format string vulnerability affecting both "Warrior Kings" and "Warrior Kings: Battles," exploitable via a malformed nickname. The second is a crash vulnerability, specific to "Warrior Kings: Battles," triggered by a partial join packet leading to a null pointer dereference. These vulnerabilities are remote and can be exploited when playing on a server.
