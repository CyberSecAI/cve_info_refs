Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the ACROS Security reports, which appear to be related to CVE-2005-1747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an HTML injection vulnerability in the BEA WebLogic Server Console. The server does not sanitize user-supplied input when generating web pages, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML, including malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary HTML code into a web page served by the WebLogic Console.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected HTML can include JavaScript code, enabling cross-site scripting attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Administrative Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal the administrator's session cookies (ADMINCONSOLESESSION), which grants them complete administrative control over the WebLogic server.
*   **Account Takeover:** By injecting malicious JavaScript into the login page, the attacker can silently transmit the administrator's username and password to a remote server, leading to account compromise.
*   **Complete Server Compromise:**  Gaining administrative access to the WebLogic server allows the attacker to compromise the security of the entire web server and any applications it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when requested from the WebLogic server, returns a page with injected HTML.
*  **Malicious Web Site:** The attacker could lure the administrator to visit a malicious website with the crafted URL, or send a malicious link via e-mail.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct URLs containing malicious HTML.
*   **Ability to induce victim interaction:** The attacker needs a method to get the administrator to visit a malicious URL while logged into the WebLogic Server Console. This could include social engineering or other means.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Specific Cookies Targeted:** The vulnerability can be used to steal the ADMINCONSOLESESSION cookie, which maintains administrative sessions.
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** The vulnerability affects WebLogic Server 8.1, Service Pack 4 and WebLogic Express 7.0, Service Pack 6. Older versions are also likely to be affected.
*  **Exploitation:** The injected script when executed has access to all information within the page including cookies. This enables the attacker to steal the session identifier.
*  **Distinction:** This vulnerability differs from normal XSS vulnerabilities in that the attacker obtains the username and password, not just the session ID.
