| [Description](#c0)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-01 04:45:05 UTC  ``` By supplying a malicious message to spamassassin (with a very long content-type header and no boundaries) you can cause it to overly consume resources and therefore perform Denial of Service on the hosting server.  Upstream is readying a 3.0.4 that will include the fix. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-07 21:56:28 UTC  ``` 3.0.4 released. Micheal please bump. Opening when there is an official  security announcement.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michael Cummings (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-08 05:19:09 UTC  ``` Ebuild posted, testing now on sparc (ran fine on my x86, but there's no mail  coming through that box). Proceed with keywording requests :)  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-08 05:51:02 UTC  ``` There are indications that the DoS is still possible using 3.0.4. I think it's urgent to wait. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Michael Cummings (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-08 05:55:05 UTC  ``` sometimes it doesn't pay to be on the ball. do you want the package pulled,  masked, or anything like that?  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-08 06:04:57 UTC  ``` No, keep it in : 1- It's just a rumor that has still to be confirmed by the SA team 2- It's not worse than the previous versions 3- Testing of the extra-security newthings in 3.0.4 can begin in ~ ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-08 09:20:07 UTC  ``` Seems to be a false alarm.

The issue in our own code is tracked as [bug 4171](show_bug.cgi?id=4171 "RESOLVED FIXED - Get traceback trying to emerge --update world after installing portage 2.0.5") in our bugzilla, the  discussion went on on our security mailinglist (open for committers only).

Debian Security Advisory 736-1                       security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Michael Stone
July 01, 2005                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : spamassassin
Vulnerability  : mail header parsing error
Problem type   : remote DOS
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CAN-2005-1266
Debian Bug     : 314447

A vulnerability was recently found in the way that SpamAssassin parses
certain email headers. This vulnerability could cause SpamAssassin to
consume a large number of CPU cycles when processing messages containing
these headers, leading to a potential denial of service (DOS) attack.

The version of SpamAssassin in the old stable distribution (woody) is
not vulnerable.

For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.3-2. Note that packages are not yet ready for certain
architectures; these will be released as they become available.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sarge or sid spamassassin package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
