  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A vulnerability exists in how SpamAssassin parses certain email headers, specifically long, misformatted headers without boundaries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of message headers",
      "Excessive resource consumption",
       "Denial of Service vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted email with a long, malformed 'Content-Type' header and no boundaries can cause SpamAssassin to consume excessive CPU cycles. This leads to a denial of service, making the server unresponsive to legitimate requests.",

      "Sending a malicious email to a vulnerable SpamAssassin server"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send emails",

    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in SpamAssassin versions 3.0.1, 3.0.2, and 3.0.3 but was introduced with a patch in 3.0.1 and was not present in version 3.0.0.
