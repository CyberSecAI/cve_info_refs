Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap overflow within the RSA SecurID Web Agent.
- It's triggered by sending a large chunk of data using the chunked-encoding mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap overflow: Specifically, the vulnerability allows overwriting critical portions of the heap memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with LocalSystem privileges.
- Denial of service: The overflow can also lead to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the web agent.
- Chunked Encoding: The vulnerability leverages the chunked encoding mechanism of the HTTP protocol

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable RSA SecurID Web Agent.
- Understanding of HTTP chunked encoding: The attacker needs to be able to craft a request with a large chunk of data to exploit the overflow.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects RSA SecurID Web Agent versions 5, 5.2 and 5.3 on Windows 2000/IIS.
- A proof-of-concept exploit was created and provided to RSA.
- The issue was initially reported to RSA in Feb 2004, but RSA did not initially respond, requiring further contact efforts and involving NISCC, resulting in a patch issued on 05/05/2005.
- The exploit allowed remote access to a Windows IIS installation.
- RSA released a patch for this vulnerability which is available through their SecurCare Online portal.
