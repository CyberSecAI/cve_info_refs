## Analysis of CVE-2005-1455

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The FreeRADIUS server failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `radius_xlat` function was called without an escape function, and the result was then simply copied.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of input sanitization allowed for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.
- Buffer Overflow: A minor buffer overflow could occur in the `sql_escape_func` when escaping characters if the available buffer space was too small.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:**
    - Disclosure of sensitive data.
    - Modification of data within the database.
    - Potential compromise of the application and the underlying database.
- **Buffer Overflow:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS) due to server crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted user-supplied input that's used in SQL queries. The specific areas were identified as lines 520, 1152, and 1196 in `rlm_sql.c` where `radius_xlat` was called without proper escaping.
- The buffer overflow vulnerability is triggered in the `sql_escape_func` when the output buffer is too small when escaping special characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **SQL Injection:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the FreeRADIUS server which will be used in SQL queries.
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated for the exploit to work as the vulnerable queries are executed after user authentication.
- **Buffer Overflow:**
     -  The attacker needs to provide input with characters that need escaping.
     - This vulnerability can be triggered remotely, leading to a potential DoS.
     - The user has some control over the input to trigger the overflow, but it's limited by the characters needed for MIME encoding.

**Additional Notes:**
- The SQL injection issue was fixed by replacing `NULL` with "sql_escape_func" in the vulnerable code locations.
- The buffer overflow was considered minor due to the large size of the output buffer, but the fix was to change the condition to `outlen <= 3`.
-  A patch was initially created which incorrectly double-escaped user input, this was corrected by applying the upstream fix from freeradius.org.
- The issue was initially considered high severity but after discussions with auditors the buffer overflow was deemed low severity and unlikely to lead to code execution, the impact was limited to DoS.
- To mitigate DoS attacks, FreeRADIUS was modified to use `radwatch`, although this was later discouraged in favor of `supervise-radiusd.txt`.
- The vulnerability was assigned two CVEs, with CVE-2005-1454 covering the buffer overflow and CVE-2005-1455 covering the SQL injection.
