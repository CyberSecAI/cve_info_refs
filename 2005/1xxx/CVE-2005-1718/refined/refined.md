### Relevant Content:
The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the War Times game server.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of NULL delimiters in text strings passed to the server. Specifically, the server concatenates a client's nickname with their IP address without proper bounds checking, resulting in a buffer overflow when a 64-byte nickname is provided.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow: The server's code does not properly allocate enough space when concatenating the client's nickname and IP address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The server crashes when a crafted nickname is sent.
- According to the author, exploitation of the buffer-overflow doesn't seem possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through in-game network communication with the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must connect to the game server.
- If the server is password-protected, the attacker needs to know the server password.
