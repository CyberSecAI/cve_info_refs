Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2005-1264:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The raw character device driver was incorrectly using the `ioctl_by_bdev()` function to pass ioctls to the underlying block device, instead of using `blkdev_ioctl()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect use of `ioctl_by_bdev()`: This function performs a `set_fs(KERNEL_DS)` before calling the ioctl, which redirects user-space buffer access to the kernel address space. This is a security issue because it allows the kernel to read from and write to user-space memory as if it were kernel memory, which bypasses normal access controls.
- Kernel address space access: The incorrect function usage could lead to unexpected behavior, such as an error (-EFAULT) or the silent failure to populate user-space buffer, in architectures where the user and kernel spaces are distinct (e.g. s390 or x86 4G:4G).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel memory access: An attacker could potentially read or write to arbitrary kernel memory via user-space ioctls, leading to a potential privilege escalation.
- System instability: Depending on how the kernel memory is manipulated, this could lead to system instability or crashes.
- Information disclosure: If kernel memory contains sensitive data it could be disclosed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to interact with the affected raw character device, in order to call the vulnerable ioctls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a local user capable of opening and performing ioctl operations on raw character devices.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was initially discovered on s390 architecture where raw IO was not functioning, due to the kernel and user address space separation.
- The issue was also reproduced on x86 with 4G:4G split memory.
- The fix involves changing the ioctl pass-through function to `blkdev_ioctl()`.
