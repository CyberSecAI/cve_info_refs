How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug     : 316276 330364

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been identified in the
helix-player media player that could allow an attacker to execute code
on the victim's machine via specially crafted network resources.

CAN-2005-1766

        Buffer overflow in the RealText parser could allow remote code
        execution via a specially crafted RealMedia file with a long
        RealText string.

CAN-2005-2710

        Format string vulnerability in Real HelixPlayer and RealPlayer 10
        allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the image
        handle attribute in a RealPix (.rp) or RealText (.rt) file.

For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-1sarge1

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.6-1

We recommend that you upgrade your helix-player package.
