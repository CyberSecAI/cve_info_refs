  "CVE-2005-1476": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from two combined flaws in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.3 and Mozilla Suite 1.7.7 related to how javascript: URIs are handled. First, the Firefox install confirmation dialog allows a 'javascript:' URL to be supplied as the IconURL property, leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of 'chrome' privileges. Second, a cross-site scripting vulnerability allows injection of script into any site by loading it in a frame and navigating back to a previous 'javascript:' URL containing an eval() call.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Improper handling of javascript: URLs in InstallTrigger's IconURL property",
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper validation of URI sources in browser history",
        "Lack of proper security checks in handling javascript: URLs during session history navigation",
          "Insufficient validation of the source domain of some URIs stored in the browser history."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to full remote compromise, including arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges, stealing cookies, and modifying content on visited sites. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the user's system, potentially causing severe damage.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Visiting a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.",
        "Clicking anywhere on a specially crafted malicious page.",
        "Navigating back to a previous page containing malicious javascript: URLs."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page and have the victim visit the page using a vulnerable version of Firefox. The attacker also needs to be able to manipulate the browser history. The attacker could also exploit the vulnerability by convincing users to add their malicious site to the software installation whitelist, though the default Mozilla Update site has been modified to prevent its use in this attack."
    },
    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from the combination of two issues. First, `InstallTrigger` allows a javascript: URL to be used as an icon, resulting in arbitrary code execution with elevated (chrome) privileges. Secondly, a cross-site scripting issue enables script injection by navigating back to a javascript: URL in the session history.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
            "Unrestricted use of javascript: URLs in `InstallTrigger`.",
            "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via history navigation."
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with chrome privileges, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions like file system modifications, steal cookies, and access confidential data from target sites.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Visiting a malicious webpage.",
             "Navigating back through browser history to a compromised page with a javascript: URL."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious page, and convince a victim using a vulnerable version of Firefox or Mozilla Suite to visit this page. The attacker must also have the user enable software installation from the attacker's website or trick a user into adding it to their whitelist."
