— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=182921&action=edit)

The big issue here is that we fire onload as another page loads when we click
on an <a> link -- filing a separate bug on this.
However, JSInstallTriggerGlobal also doesn't do any checking on the icon URI;
it should also disallow javascript URIs for both passed-in URIs (perhaps only
file, http, ftp).

Attached patch

[patch disallowing javascript and data URIs in InstallTrigger](attachment.cgi?id=182930&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=182930&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=292691&attachment=182930)

This patch at least prevents the specific bit of the code that's executing with
chrome privs, by disallowing javascript: and data: URIs for being used as xpi
or image URLs by InstallTrigger.
I originally did this patch by adding a flags param to secman
CheckLoadURIFromScript, which would get passed down to CheckLoadURI instead of
always using STANDARD (so that InstallTrigger could specify
DISALLOW\_SCRIPT\_OR\_DATA); if that approach is preferred, I have that patch as
well. (This one touches less code, but it introduces javascript/data rejection
logic here instead of keeping it all in secman.)

[Comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=292691#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Full Remote Compromise using some of my previous vulns") first paragraph talks about a separate bug, which was [bug 293326](/show_bug.cgi?id=293326 "RESOLVED INVALID - iframe onload handler fires when new page is loaded inside"), but
that's invalid.
The feature of javascript: URLs, whereby they load against the current doc, is a
feature. We need to secure it by tracking the origin of the javascript: URL.

The XSS testcase works reliably in 1.0.3, but on trunk, you might have to try it
several times before it will work. I don't know why.

Attached patch

[Make javascript from session history execute in intermittent about:blank page and not in the current page.](attachment.cgi?id=183002&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=183002&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=292691&attachment=183002)

This fixes this by making it so that javascript in session history URLs don't
ever have a chance to execute in the current page, in stead they execute in a
temporary about:blank page to prevent any sort of data leakage from the current
page.

patch disallowing javascript and data URIs in InstallTrigger

Unless there's a reason not to, I'd like to flip this around to failing all
loads if we can't get a security manager (other code already does this).
dveditz probably knows whether this code ever runs someplace where there's no
security manager, if not, I'd like to see this pass &rv to do\_GetService() and
returning that if it failed. Otherwise one could theoretically get around the
security checks in low memory conditions or whatever.
sr=jst either way though.

patch disallowing javascript and data URIs in InstallTrigger
Special-casing javascript: checks invites workarounds (view-source, jar) as we
saw with the favicon bug

I think Johnny's right, if no security manager we should fail.
>+ rv = secman->CheckLoadURIFromScript(cx, uri);
>+ if (NS\_FAILED(rv))
>+ return rv;
Instead of this, get the codebase from the context and call CheckLoadURI with
the disallow-script-or-data flag.
nsCOMPtr<nsIURI> scriptURI;
nsCOMPtr<nsIPrincipal> principal;
rv = secman->GetSubjectPrincipal(getter\_AddRefs(principal));
NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
if (!principal)
return NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE;
rv = principal->GetURI(getter\_AddRefs(scriptURI));
NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
rv = secman->CheckLoadURI(scriptURI, uri,
nsIScriptSecurityManager::DISALLOW\_SCRIPT\_OR\_DATA);

Something like this I think. Don't need to pass in cx because
getSubjectPrincipal() should grab the right one

Attached patch

[disallow script urls in InstallTrigger (v2)](attachment.cgi?id=183020&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=183020&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=292691&attachment=183020)

This variation on vlad's patch incorporates my review comments and fixes the
[bug 292499](/show_bug.cgi?id=292499 "RESOLVED FIXED - Addon Install feature can execute javascript in context of \"chrome\"") aspect of this exploit. Can be tested with
javascript:InstallTrigger.install({'blah':{URL:'<http://www.mozilla.org>',
IconURL:"javascript:eval('alert(Components.stack)')"}});void(0)
The site you run the URL on must be whitelisted of course.
Expected behavior: throw an exception (see js console)
Actual behavior (pre patch): alert demonstrates running with chrome privilege

how does frame history differ from full pages? javascript urls do not appear to
execute if I navigate back from a full page ([bug 88167](/show_bug.cgi?id=88167 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security: session history actions apply javascript: URLs to current page") that Jesse mentioned).

If we just call CheckLoadURI here, we don't honor UniversalFileRead for
file/resource access like CheckLoadURIFromScript does; probably not a big deal,
as I can't think of any usage when a remote app might want to actually enable
that and use InstallTrigger with a local file: URI.

Yeah, probably not a big deal. Seems like we should have a checkloaduri function
that takes a JS context, uri, and flags. But that's not for this bug... I'll
land the change as is.

QA found that theme installation is broken in builds that include these changes.
I tracked the problem down to the new InstallTriggerCheckLoadURIFromScript()
code, the problem is that it gets the URL out of the running principal, which in
the theme case is the system principal and the system principal has no URL. Keywords: [fixed-aviary1.0.4](/buglist.cgi?keywords=fixed-aviary1.0.4&resolution=---),

I can not reproduce the failure I mentioned using Jesse's testcase in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=292691#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Full Remote Compromise using some of my previous vulns")
using Firefox 1.0.4. I was able to crash once again using 1.0.4 by clicking the
link in the lower iframe and reloading a couple of times. It was not
reproducible in a debug build. Unfortunately, talkback won't send my incident or
at least won't tell me the incident id...
I think the testcase at
<<http://test.bclary.com/tests/mozilla.org/security/292691-01.html>> is flawed. I
will fix it and report back.

Ok, I fixed <<http://test.bclary.com/tests/mozilla.org/security/292691-01.html>>
and it now agrees with Jesse's case. Firefox 1.0.4/Mozilla 1.7.8 both pass it,
but Firefox trunk/Mozilla trunk both fail it. MSIE6/Opera both pass it.

public face of this bug please leave this bug hidden until [bug 290982](/show_bug.cgi?id=290982 "RESOLVED FIXED - The view-source: pseudo protocol can be used to do cross-domain scripting") is fixed.Whiteboard: [sg:fix] Keep private 'til 1.0.4 for dev discussion. 293302 is public → [sg:fix] Keep private until 290982 fixed. 293302 is public

Hmm, nsJARChannel.cpp is present in both modules/libjar/ and
netwerk/protocol/jar/src/ but only copy in modules/libjar/ was patched.
Shouldn't both files be patched (and kept in sync) ?

I don't see any crashes in Talkback data with "nsIDocument::GetParentDocument"
as the stack signature. If anyone is able to reproduce this with a Talkback
enabled build, that will be great. I have not been able to crash myself using
bclary's steps to reproduce.

This patch has been checked into the Aviary 1.0.1 and Mozilla 1.7 branches. It
could not be applied to the trunk, so I did not land it on the trunk.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-42

## Code execution via javascript: IconURL

Announced
May 8, 2005
Reporter
Paul (Greyhats)
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.4
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.8

### Description

Two vulnerabilities found in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.3 when combined allow
an attacker to run arbitrary code. The Mozilla Suite version 1.7.7
is only partially vulnerable.

A vulnerability in the Firefox install confirmation dialog
allows an attacker to supply a `javascript:` URL as
the IconURL property, which will execute code.
By using an eval() call in that URL arbitrary code can be
executed with elevated privilege.
By default only the Mozilla Update site is allowed
to attempt software installation but users can allow other sites.

A second flaw in Firefox 1.0.3 and the Mozilla Suite 1.7.7 allows
an attacker to inject script into any site by loading it in a frame
and navigating back to a previous `javascript:` URL
containing an eval() call. This can be used to steal cookies or
other confidential data from the target site. If the target site
is allowed to raise the install confirmation dialog in Firefox
then this attack can be combined with the first to execute
arbitrary code.

The default Mozilla Update site has been modified to prevent
its use in this attack.

### Workaround

Changes were made to the default Mozilla Update site to protect users
from these attacks shortly after this attack became public.
Users who have added other extension or theme sites to the software
installation whitelist should remove them until they have upgraded to a
fixed version of Firefox.

1. Select the "Options" dialog from the "Tools" menu
2. Select the "Web Features" icon
3. Click the "Allowed Sites" button on the same line as the
   "Allow web sites to install software" checkbox
4. Click the "Remove All Sites" button
5. Click "OK"

Disabling Javascript will prevent both attacks.

## Mozilla fails to properly prevent "JavaScript:" URIs containing "eval()" from being executed in the context of other URIs in the history list

#### Vulnerability Note VU#534710

Original Release Date: 2005-05-10 | Last Revised: 2005-08-09

---

### Overview

Mozilla fails to properly restrict the execution of javascript: URIs. The impact is similar to that of a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which allows an attacker to access data in other sites.

### Description

| Mozilla uses a [same origin](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/same-origin.html) security model to maintain separation between browser frames from different sources. This model is designed to prevent code in one domain from accessing data in a different domain. From the same origin policy:  *Mozilla considers two pages to have the same origin if the protocol, port (if given), and host are the same for both pages.* Mozilla can evaluate script contained in a URI. For example, either of the following URIs will display an alert dialog containing the text "Hello world.":  javascript:eval('alert("Hello world.")')javascript:alert("Hello world.")  This URI will display an alert dialog with the contents of the HTTP cookie for the current site:  javascript:alert(document.cookie)  The same origin security model should not allow script from one domain to read or modify data in a different domain using this type of "script URI".Mozilla does not properly validate the source domain of some URIs stored in the browser history. Script in a URI stored in the history can be executed in the context of a different domain. An attacker can create a javascript: URI containing eval(), cause the user to visit a web site in a different domain, and then programmatically cause the web browser to return to the previous javascript: page to trigger the cross-domain violation. The violation will also occur if the user manually clicks the "Back" button to return to the javascript: page.In limited testing, Firefox 1.0.3 and Mozilla 1.7.7 are vulnerable. Previous versions do not appear to be vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a victim to view an HTML document (web page), an attacker could evaluate script in a different security domain than the one containing the attacker's document. The attacker could read or modify data in other web sites (read cookies/content, modify/create content, etc.). If the script is evaluated with chrome privileges, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the user's system. VU#648758 describes one way to execute script with chrome privileges. However, due to recent changes made to the addons.mozilla.org and update.mozilla.org sites, the current proof-of-concept code that utilizes VU#648758 no longer functions properly. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This issue is resolved in [Firefox 1.0.4](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) and [Mozilla 1.7.8](http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/). |
| --- |

| **Workarounds****Disable JavaScript**Disable JavaScript in your browser's preferences. Instructions for disabling JavaScript can be found in the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#mozilla1). |

I'm not sure what the answer is to your specific question but according to
Whitedust Security @ <http://www.whitedust.net/newsview.php?NewsID=450> :
"...it has been confirmed that this exploit does not only affect Microsoft
Windows users but, if the code is adapted, can also affect both MacOS and \*nix
operating systems running vulnerable version of Firefox...the code uses built-in
Mozilla JavaScript extensions to create a local file in a very straightforward way."

My question relates to the fact that on a Unix platform, filenames do not
determine whether or not a file can be made self-executable - the file's
permission bits are the determining factor. If the exploit code can be adapted
to create executable files and/or create shell scripts that can be executed by a
shell, then this exploit is very serious indeed.

I would like to send an update to Secunia on [Bug 293302](/show_bug.cgi?id=293302 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - Firefox 1.0.3 Critical Vulnerability") - Firefox 1.0.3
Critical Vulnerability.
I saw Chris Thomas's post saying "We took some steps on
the update.mozilla.org side to mitigate the problem." Can someone explain (here
or in an email to me) what steps were taken?
Am I correct if I say "This vulnerability can not be exploited in the
default configuration of Fx because the Fx team has taken steps to
mitigate the problem at (the default sites) update.mozilla.org and
addons.mozilla.org" ?

This exploit can ause arbitrary code to run with chrome privileges. It can
therefore do basically anything Mozilla can do, including create, delete, and
modify files.

Thanks for the quick reply Gavin. I've sent the update off to Securnia
suggesting that the threat level should be lowered.
However...WhiteDust Security has added an update to the report at
<http://www.whitedust.net/newsview.php?NewsID=450> that says:
"To add to the mass of Firefox security fears surrounding this exploit it now
transpires that the "whitelist" which it had been claimed would protect users
from this exploit is in fact faulty. While it is true that Firefox is only
supposed to download and install things from the whitelist in truth it can
easily be fooled into thinking that another site is mozilla.org. As long as you
have any sites listed in your "whitelist" you are vulnerable to this exploit."
Please tell me it isn't so.

Testcase 2
It only works for 1) sites on your whitelist that 2) have an install function
that is callable. In our case, morgamic basically made the install() function
be randomly named.
However, if you can add an onclick for that page to call the chrome install()
function, then we have a bigger problem.

As it turns out, that's not \_entirely\_ true - there were still ways to exploit
the browser even with the randomized install. We've moved Mozilla Update to an
untrusted domain name to prevent the remaining issues.

The alarmist article makes it sound like the whitelist compounds the problem. On
the contrary, it means that two flaws have to be exploited rather than just one.
On the whole, the Whitedust article is pretty inaccurate and they don't really
seem to understand how it works. Their fawning over FrSIRT seems to be misplaced
too as from what I can see, FrSIRT just got the flaw details leaked to them.
Read <http://greyhatsecurity.org/firefox.htm> for a far better explanation.

No. This bug covers the publicly announced vulnerability perfectly well. The
developers are using the other bug to probe for similar vulnerabilities that we
don't wish to reveal until the fix is released in 1.0.4

Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the privilege escalation part only involve
InstallTrigger's iconURL? Can't we just disable the icon URL parameter on UMO
and keep the rest of the code, so that at least people can still install
extensions without needing to do it manually? Or is the problem bigger than I
imagined?
i.e.,
- function install(aEvent, extName, iconURL) {
+ function install(aEvent, extName) {
...
var params = new Array();
params[extName] = {
URL: aEvent.target.href,
- IconURL: iconURL,
toString: function () { return this.URL; }
};
InstallTrigger.install(params);

The bug can be exploited without any help from the trusted site. One empty page
in a trusted domain is enough for a modified exploit to work. The bug has to be
fixed in Firefox before UMO can be restored. UMO should probably keep
redirecting vulnerable Firefox versions to an untrusted domain indefinitely.
There are also third party domains with a high probability of being whitelisted,
if the user is an avid theme and extension fan.
I would also like to add that turning off software installation is insufficient.
The cross site scripting part of the exploit can still be used to steal cookies
from arbitrary sites if the user does not disable Javascript entirely. Since
cookies are frequently used for autologin purposes, this is a very serious
vulnerability.

Yes, I've just made a modified version of the exploit which works with
<http://www.vatica.va> (the Holy See): of course I had to add that site to my
white list, but there's no need of particular code on the target page.
I'd like to add that having a \*small\* patch in the form of an extension, as an
alternative to the whole 5MB package, is a critical, necessary move.

There is no (AFAIK) need to remove iconURL completely, and I don't expect it to
be removed, because you only need a check for javascript: url's/code.

Is javascript: the only URL that inherits principals in this way? If so, perhaps
the default should be to disallow javascript: URLs in some core code, and then

Well, Alex Bishops' post at mozillaZine made it clear that some check were
missing "...From my understanding, the problem is basically a few missing
checks..."
see also: <http://mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6582#3>
and Michael Krax confirmed today (per e-mail) that the iconURL part is basically
the same as [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=290036](/show_bug.cgi?id=290036 "RESOLVED FIXED - Link tag allows to execute arbitrary code without user interaction")

Well thanks kerl ;-)
It's not the first time I post some stuff on bugzilla, and I read all the
comments before, and I just saw :
- that the bug is supposed to affect "1.0.3 and all previous versions" : I don't
see this statement as true.
- that the bug supposedly affects you as soon as you've "enable javascript" and
"enable sites to download software" : I don't see this as true either.
I tried both "exploit proofs of concept" and all fail...
As for the slight modification (random number etc) done on the mozilla site to
work around the problem, I don't think they account for the two errors I got,
namely "access denied to window.name" and "javascript error string unterminated
at...", do they ? ;-)
That's purely factual.
That's all I had to share with people able to read correctly.

The UMO workaround has changed. The current fix is a new DNS,
do-not-add.mozilla.org. The testcases attached here used our install function,
but the InstallTrigger.install() is what is vulnerable.

I have already add do-not-add.mozilla.org and it still doesn't work.

[Testcase - Just for IconURL](attachment.cgi?id=183154)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=183154&action=edit)

This testcase only tests the IconURL part of the vulnerability. Not the cross
site scripting. The testcase only seems to work when you have venkman open. –
very weird.

Or simpler, type the following in the URL bar when you are showing a page on a
whitelisted site (and \*please\* do not whitelist bugzilla)
javascript:InstallTrigger.install({'blah':{URL:'<http://www.mozilla.org',IconURL>:"javascript:eval('alert(Components.stack)')"}});void(0)
If you get an alert showing the context stack that shows you've gotten chrome
privileges.Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

Thank you, and thank you Gary :-)
Daniel, will the XPInstall process fail in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 when the
security manager detects such a script, and if yes, will there be a browser info
message in this case?

Using "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050510
Firefox/1.0.4" on a site which is "allowed to install software" and with java
and javascript enabled, pasting the above javascript: line in the URL bar
produces no reaction whatsoever, even after hitting Enter or clicking the Go button.
Does that mean my "aviary nightly" version of Fx is already patched against the
exploit?

Yes, a checkin was made "mozilla/xpinstall/src/nsJSInstallTriggerGlobal.cpp" to
fix the IconURL issue.
Help is needed with testing. Please see

Attached file
[Testcase for the cross-site scripting part of the problem](attachment.cgi?id=183228)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=183228&action=edit)

This is a simplified (sort of) test case based on ffrc.html by Greyhats
Security et al.
Click on the first "click here". An alert saying "www.mozilla.com..." appears
when you are vulnerable and the javascript: URL is re-evaluated within
www.mozilla.com's context.
The second part of the page demonstrates what happens when you try to load
javascript: URL directly into a non-empty iframe. It fails with "Attempt to
load a javascript: URL from one host in a window displaying content from
another host was blocked by the security manager."
It appears there is a problem in nsJSThunk::EvaluateScript
(dom/src/jsurl/nsJSProtocolHandler.cpp). A direct attack is caught but an
indirect one avoids the same-origin check because "owner" is null ("No owner
from channel, use the current URI to generate a principal", see
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/dom/src/jsurl/nsJSProtocolHandler.cpp#236>)
Does it make any sense to allow the evaluation when the owner is unknown? It is
inherently unsafe to make such a piece of code "fail-open".

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
