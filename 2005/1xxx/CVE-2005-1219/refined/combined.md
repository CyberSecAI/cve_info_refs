How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Color Management Module buffer overflow during profile tag validation

#### Vulnerability Note VU#720742

Original Release Date: 2005-07-12 | Last Revised: 2005-07-22

---

### Overview

Microsoft Color Management Module contains a flaw that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The [Microsoft Color Management Module](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/color/icmwp.mspx) provides consistent color management operations between applications and devices, and transforms between colorspaces such as 'RGB' and 'CMYK'. International Color Consortium (ICC) profiles help perform these tasks. ICC data files, or 'profiles', are available for a wide range of devices. Certain file types, such as PNG and JPEG, may allow a user to embed a color profile format tag within the file data in order to specify the ICC profile associated with the file or device.  An attacker may be able to craft an image file with an embedded ICC profile format tag such that a buffer overflow condition occurs during validation of the tag. This buffer overflow condition may result in the attacker gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code.Please note that according to public reports, this vulnerability is being actively exploited. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view an image with a maliciously crafted ICC profile tag, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands or code with the privileges of the user. This may be accomplished by including the specially crafted image in a web page or an HTML email message. The attacker could take any action as the user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the user's system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Microsoft has addressed this issue in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-036](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-036.mspx). |
| --- |

| In addition, the following workarounds may help to limit the scope and impact of the vulnerability:**Read and send email in plain text format**Outlook 2003, Outlook 2002 SP1, and Outlook 6 SP1 can be configured to view email messages in text format. Consider the security of fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when possible.**Do not follow unsolicited links**In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |

## Vulnerability Details

#### Color Management Module Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1219:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Color Management Module because of the way that it handles ICC profile format tag validation. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious image file that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Color Management Module Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1219:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).
