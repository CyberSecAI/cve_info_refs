The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `forum.pl` script, which allows for both file disclosure and remote command execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `forum.pl` script directly uses user-supplied input without proper sanitization. This allows for the injection of arbitrary file paths or shell commands via URL parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** The script allows an attacker to specify a file path to be displayed (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) by injecting it as a URL parameter.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** The script executes shell commands specified by an attacker via URL parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **File Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, password files, and other confidential data.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `forum.pl` script, with the malicious file path or command in the URL query parameters.
    *   `http://www.target.com/cgi-bin/forum.pl?/etc/passwd` - for file disclosure
    *   `http://www.target.com/cgi-bin/forum.pl?|command` - for command execution

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `forum.pl` script. No prior authentication is required.
