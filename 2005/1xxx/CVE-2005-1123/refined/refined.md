Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1123:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a format string bug in the `m_build_buffer_from_buffer()` function within the monkeyd HTTP server. This function improperly handles format specifiers in user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The core issue is the presence of a format string vulnerability, which can be triggered remotely through a crafted HTTP request. The `m_build_buffer_from_buffer()` function is vulnerable to double expansion, allowing an attacker to control format string specifiers.
*   **Memory Corruption:** A separate issue related to a local denial of service occurs when processing zero-byte files. Specifically, the `M_free` function uses `memset` incorrectly in combination with the output from `malloc(0)`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The format string vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running the monkeyd process.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption issue involving zero-byte files can be exploited to cause the server to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote (Format String):** The format string vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request containing format string specifiers in the Host header.
*   **Local (DoS):** The DoS vulnerability can be triggered by requesting a zero-byte file present within the htdocs directory repeatedly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote (Format String):** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Local (DoS):** The attacker needs to have access to the server filesystem with a zero-byte file in the document root or have the ability to create one.

**Additional Details:**
* The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200504-14)  identifies both the format string vulnerability (CVE-2005-1122) and the denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2005-1123) as being present in monkeyd versions prior to 0.9.1.
* The Gentoo Bugzilla entry Bug 87916 provides additional insight into the discovery and patching process for these issues.
* The `M_free` function in monkeyd incorrectly used `memset(ptr, '\0', sizeof(ptr))` which is meant to zero out the allocated memory, but actually only zeros out the size of the pointer itself.

**Summary**

The monkeyd HTTP server had multiple vulnerabilities, one of them being CVE-2005-1123, a local Denial-of-Service vulnerability caused by a memory corruption issue. This vulnerability, alongside a separate format string vulnerability, allowed attackers to remotely execute code or locally crash the server.
