How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  rob holland (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-04 08:26:23 UTC  ``` Putting a zero byte file in htdocs somewhere and then requesting it repeatedly will cause monkeyd to corrupt memory/blow up depending on MALLOC_CHECK_  Dodgy code is:  void M_free(void *ptr) {     if(ptr!=NULL){         memset(ptr, '\0', sizeof(ptr));         free(ptr);         ptr=NULL;     } }  The memset doesn't do what was intended. This isn't normally visible but the 0 byte file causes monkeyd to malloc(0) which means there is no data allocated to "absorb" the broken memset call. The ptr=NULL thing is also just plain weird :)  Problem was spotted by ciaranm and investigated by me.

# monkeyd: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200504-14**

Format string and Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been discovered in
the monkeyd HTTP server, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/monkeyd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.1** |

### Background

monkeyd is a fast, efficient, small and easy to configure web server
for Linux.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered a
double expansion error in monkeyd, resulting in a format string
vulnerability. Ciaran McCreesh of Gentoo Linux discovered a Denial of
Service vulnerability, a syntax error caused monkeyd to zero out
unallocated memory should a zero byte file be requested.

### Impact

The format string vulnerability could allow an attacker to send a
specially crafted request to the monkeyd server, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
monkeyd. The DoS vulnerability could allow an attacker to disrupt the
operation of the web server, should a zero byte file be accessible.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All monkeyd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/monkeyd-0.9.1"
```
