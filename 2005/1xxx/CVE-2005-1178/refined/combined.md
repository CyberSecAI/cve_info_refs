## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

   SQL Injection in Oracle Forms V1.01

Summary:

All Oracle Forms applications are vulnerable against SQL Injection by
default.
Oracle Applications >=11.5.9 is not affected due to the default setting
value “FORMSxx_RESTRICT_ENTER_QUERY = TRUE”.
(VU#718548)

About Oracle Forms: Oracle Forms 10g is Oracle's award winning Web Rapid Application

Development tool, part of the Oracle Developer Suite 10g. It is a highly
productive, end-to-end, PL/SQL based, development environment for
building enterprise-class, database centric Internet applications. Oracle
Application Server 10g provides out-of-the-box optimized Web
deployment platform for Oracle Forms 10g. Oracle itself is using
Oracle Forms for Oracle Applications.

Affected products:  All versions of Oracle Forms (3.0-10g, C/S and Web), Oracle Clinical,

Oracle Developer Suite

Fix:

Set the undocumented environment variable
FORMSxx_RESTRICT_ENTER_QUERY=true
(FORMS60_RESTRICT_ENTER_QUERY for Forms 6.x,
FORMS90_RESTRICT_ENTER_QUERY for Forms 9.x/10g)
and restart the Forms server. This environment variable disables the
possibility of using the query/where functionality.

or only if really need Query/Where:

Write a PRE_QUERY/ON-ERROR-trigger for EVERY input field and
validate the entire input for EVERY Oracle Forms module (*.fmb)

   SQL Injection in Oracle Forms V1.01

Background:
There is an (ancient often forgotten) Oracle Forms feature called “Query/Where” which
allows any user to modify existing SQL statements. This is a quite useful feature for power
users but also dangerous because every forms user can execute any SQL statement.

Short demonstration of SQL Injection

1. Start a Forms module and switch to the query mode and enter a colon (“:”) or ampersand
(“&”)

2. An empty Query/Where windows pops up

3. Enter an SQL statement
The following statement sends the result of the SQL statement “select username from
all_users where rownum=1” to a foreign (or internal) web server. Keep in mind that
utl_http.request accepts only one row of the results.

   SQL Injection in Oracle Forms V1.01

The web server of the attacker now contains the result of the custom query:

192.168.2.200 - - [14/Feb/2005:10:42:20 +0100] "GET /SYS HTTP/1.1" 404 209

If your SQL statement is not correct like the following example

Oracle returns an error “FRM-40505: Oracle error: unable to perform query.”

You can obtain a detailed error message by selecting the “Display Error” in the “Help”
menu

   SQL Injection in Oracle Forms V1.01

Impact:
The impact of the SQL injection depends on the architecture of your Forms application.

If the Oracle user used by the Forms application has DBA privileges (like Oracle
Applications), EVERY user can select any data in the database. Never set the value
FORMSxx_RESTRICT_ENTER_QUERY to FALSE in an existing Oracle Applications
environment because every user can execute ANY statement and see ANY data.

If your Forms application implements an own user concept (e.g. own user table including
passwords) it is possible that, other users could see the data (e.g. their
accounts/passwords/…).

In all other cases the Forms user can still execute PLSQL packages granted to public like
utl_http.

Fix:
There are two different possibilities to fix this problem:

(a)  Disable the Query/Where function by setting the environment variable (introduced

with Forms 6.0.8.18.0) FORMSxx_RESTRICT_ENTER_QUERY=true
(xx=60 for Forms 6.x, xx=90 for Forms 9.x/10g)
and restart the Forms server.
Check if Query/Where is now disabled.

(b)  Write a PRE_QUERY and an ON-ERROR trigger for EVERY input field to validate
the user input. An example of this can be found in Metalink note 163305.1.

Keep in mind that the solution suggested in this Metalink article is incomplete because
the checks for $ and # are missing.
