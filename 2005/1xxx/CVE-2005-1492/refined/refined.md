  "additional_notes": "The provided error messages are identical and indicate a common error in the `GForum/Post/View.pm` script within the gossamer-threads.com environment. The specific line of code (line 71) is attempting to use a database result before validating that a valid result exists. This is often due to an edge case or unexpected input/conditions where a database lookup is failing and returning no results, or `undef`, which will lead to this error when the code then tries to perform actions upon it."
