# MPlayer: Two heap overflow vulnerabilities — GLSA **200504-19**

Two vulnerabilities have been found in MPlayer which could lead to the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/mplayer** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0\_pre6-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0\_pre6-r4** |

### Background

MPlayer is a media player capable of handling multiple multimedia file
formats.

### Description

Heap overflows have been found in the code handling RealMedia RTSP and
Microsoft Media Services streams over TCP (MMST).

### Impact

By setting up a malicious server and enticing a user to use its
streaming data, a remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code
on the client computer with the permissions of the user running
MPlayer.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre6-r4"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# xine security announcement: multiple heap overflows in MMS and Real RTSP streaming clients

---

*From*: Michael Roitzsch <mroi () users sourceforge net>

*Date*: Thu, 21 Apr 2005 21:53:08 +0200

```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

xine security announcement
==========================

Announcement-ID: XSA-2004-8

Summary:
By a user receiving data from a malicious network streaming server, an
attacker can overrun a heap buffer, which can, on some systems, lead to
or help in executing attacker-chosen malicious code with the permissions
of the user running a xine-lib based media application.

Description:
Both the MMS and Real RTSP streaming client code made some too strong
assumptions on the transfered data. Several critical bounds checks were
missing, resulting in the possibility of heap overflows, should the remote
server not adhere to these assumptions. In the MMS case, a remote server
could present content with too many individual streams, in the RTSP case,
a remote server's reply could have too many lines.
An attacker can setup a server delivering malicious data to the users. This
can be used to overflow a heap buffer, which can, with certain implementations
of heap management, lead to attacker chosen data written to the stack. This
can cause attacker-chosen code being executed with the permissions of the
user running the application. By tricking users to retrieve a stream, which
can be as easy as providing a link on a website, this vulnerability can be
exploited remotely.

Severity:
This is difficult to exploit remotely, because the indirection involved
requires precision and knowledge of the target machine: The heap overlow
needs to alter heap management information in a way so that a return adress
on the stack is modified. This adress must lead to some malicious code to be
executed, which needs to be injected somehow.
The involved xine plugin is part of the standard xine installation, so we
consider this problem to be moderately severe.

Affected versions:
All 0.9 releases starting with and including 0.9.9
All 1-alpha releases.
All 1-beta releases.
All 1-rc releases.
The 1.0 release.

Unaffected versions:
All releases older than 0.9.9.
1.0.1 or newer.

Solution:
The enclosed patches which have been applied to xine-lib CVS fix the problem
but should only be used by distributors who do not want to upgrade.
Otherwise, we strongly advise everyone to upgrade to the soon to arrive 1.0.1
release of xine-lib.
As a temporary workaround, you may delete the files "xineplug_inp_mms.so" and
"xineplug_inp_rtsp.so" from the xine-lib plugin directory, losing the ability
to use MMS or Real RTSP streaming content.

Patches:
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xine/xine-lib/src/input/librtsp/rtsp.c?r1=1.18&r2=1.19&diff_format=u>
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xine/xine-lib/src/input/mms.c?r1=1.55&r2=1.56&diff_format=u>

team. Our website is <http://xinehq.de/>

| [Description](#c0)  Andre Hinrichs    2005-04-16 00:57:46 UTC  ``` As stated on the official mplayer homepage there are two head overflows. Fixes are available for download on the homepage. I will attach the ported patches. Interestingly, they write about a pre7 version on the homepage, but it's not officially been released yet.   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Andre Hinrichs    2005-04-16 00:59:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 56428](attachment.cgi?id=56428 "Real RTSP heap overflow patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=56428&action=edit "Real RTSP heap overflow patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=56428&action=diff "Real RTSP heap overflow patch")] Real RTSP heap overflow patch ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Andre Hinrichs    2005-04-16 01:00:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 56429](attachment.cgi?id=56429 "MMST heap overflow patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=56429&action=edit "MMST heap overflow patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=56429&action=diff "MMST heap overflow patch")] MMST heap overflow patch ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-04-16 02:42:28 UTC  ``` 2005.04.16, Saturday :: MMST heap overflow posted by Roberto Summary  A potential buffer overflow was found and fixed in code used to handle MMST streams. Severity  High (arbitrary remote code execution under the user ID running the player) when streaming MMS/TCP data from a malicious server, null if you do not use this feature. At this time there is no known exploit. Description  While enumerating streams from a server, MMST code stores stream IDs in a fixed length array, but there is no check to stop the process if too many stream IDs are received. A malicious server could announce more than 20 streams and overflow the array. Solution  A fix for the vulnerability was checked into MPlayer CVS on Fri Apr 15 23:31:57 2005 UTC. Users of affected MPlayer versions should upgrade to an unaffected MPlayer version. Alternatively a patch is available that can be applied to the MPlayer source tree. Affected versions  MPlayer 1.0pre6 and before (including pre6a) Unaffected versions  MPlayer 1.0pre7 and after CVS HEAD after Fri Apr 15 23:31:57 2005 UTC  =====================   2005.04.16, Saturday :: Real RTSP heap overflow posted by Roberto Summary  A potential buffer overflow was found and fixed in code used to handle RealMedia RTSP streams. Severity  High (arbitrary remote code execution under the user ID running the player) when streaming RTSP data from a malicious server, null if you do not use this feature. At this time there is no known exploit. Description  While getting lines from a server, Real RTSP code stores them in a fixed size array of MAX_FIELDS elements, but there is no check to stop the process if too many lines are received. A malicious server could send more than MAX_FIELDS lines and overflow the array. Since the array holds pointers to answer strings, an attacker cannot write arbitrary data into it, making an exploit more difficult. Solution  A fix for the vulnerability was checked into MPlayer CVS on Fri Apr 15 23:30:44 2005 UTC. Users of affected MPlayer versions should upgrade to an unaffected MPlayer version. Alternatively a patch is available that can be applied to the MPlayer source tree.
