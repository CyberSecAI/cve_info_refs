- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GoodTech SMTP Server for Windows NT/2000/XP version 5.14 does not properly check or filter input to the `RCPT TO` command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation. Specifically, sending a single character 'A' as an argument to the `RCPT TO` command causes the smtpd process to crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). The smtpd process terminates, rendering the mail server unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker can connect to the SMTP server on port 25 and send crafted commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the vulnerable server on port 25. They must also be able to send SMTP commands.
