Package: libruby1.8
Version: 1.8.2-7
Severity: grave
Tags: security fixed-upstream

Please consider about this issue[1]. This has already been fixed on
upstream CVS r1.4[2][3], however, I don't have certain idea whether I
should treat this issue as a security issue or normal (but grave ;)
bug within Debian, so that I'm sending this report to maintonly@bugs
at this time. If this should be treated as a security issue, please do
as such or let me know what can I do. Anyway, I'd like new packages to
be uploaded to security.d.o's sarge/updates (or similar) as well.

 1. <http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/5237>
 2. <http://www.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ruby/lib/xmlrpc/utils.rb.diff?r1=1.3;r2=1.4>
 3. libruby1.9 (1.9.0+20050412-3) is also problematic.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 748-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Michael Stone
July 10, 2005                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : ruby1.8
Vulnerability  : arbitrary command execution
Problem type   : bad default value
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-1992

A vulnerability has been discovered in ruby1.8 that could allow arbitrary
command execution on a server running the ruby xmlrpc server.

The old stable distribution (woody) did not include ruby1.8.

This problem is fixed for the current stable distribution (sarge) in
version 1.8.2-7sarge1.

This problem is fixed for the unstable distribution in version 1.8.2-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.8 package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 3.1 (sarge)
- ------------------

  sarge was released for alpha, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

## Ruby library contains vulnerable default value

#### Vulnerability Note VU#684913

Original Release Date: 2005-10-03 | Last Revised: 2005-10-18

---

### Overview

Ruby includes a vulnerable default value that may be used to bypass security restrictions and execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Ruby is vulnerable to an attack on applications using the XML-RPC services via XMLRPC.iPIMethods, due to an insecure default value in utils.rb. Any program or application using the XML-RPC services provided by XMLRPC.iPIMethods may be affected. Due to the vulnerability occurring in code that is typically used to provide remote services, this may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  Please see the [Ruby XMLRPC.iPIMethods Vulnerability note](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/20050701.html) for more information, or contact your vendor for an update. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
