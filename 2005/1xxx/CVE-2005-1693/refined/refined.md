The provided content is related to CVE-2005-1693.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer wrap during the analysis of an OLE stream within the Computer Associates Vet library. Specifically, a 32-bit length value within decompressed VBA directories project name records is incremented for a null byte.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow leading to heap overflow
- Incorrect allocation size calculation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can gain unauthorized control of data and privileges on protected systems.
- Potential for further network compromise.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through common protocols (SMTP, FTP, SMB, etc.)
- Exploitation can occur without authentication or user interaction.
- Multiple exploitation attempts are possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted OLE stream with a specific project name length designed to trigger the integer wrap.
- Exploitable through common network protocols.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send malicious OLE streams to systems using the vulnerable Vet library
- No authentication or user interaction is required.
