  "CVE-2005-1155": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Mozilla may execute JavaScript contained within a site icon tag with elevated privileges. This may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Mozilla executes script within a LINK tag that specifies a site icon. This script is treated as a chrome script and is therefore granted extra privileges. By granting UniversalXPConnect privileges to itself, a chrome script can gain unrestricted access to browser APIs using XPConnect. A script with these privileges may create and execute arbitrary files on the local filesystem.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper handling of javascript: URLs in the <LINK rel=\"icon\"> tag",
        "Execution of script with elevated privileges",
        "Lack of sufficient checks on the type of URL being handled for favicons"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands or code with the privileges of the user, potentially leading to complete control of the user's system if the user has administrative privileges.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Convincing a user to view a malicious HTML document (e.g., a web page) containing a crafted <LINK> tag.",
        "Exploiting the vulnerability by using a javascript: URL within the site icon tag."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create or modify a web page to include a malicious <LINK> tag pointing to a javascript: URL. They would need to entice the user to visit the crafted page.",
