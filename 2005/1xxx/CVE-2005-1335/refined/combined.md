## Apple Mac OS X chpass/chfn/chsh utilities do not properly validate external programs

#### Vulnerability Note VU#331694

Original Release Date: 2005-05-16 | Last Revised: 2005-05-25

---

### Overview

Apple Mac OS X Directory Service utilities use external programs insecurely, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The OS X Directory Services have three utilities chpass, chfn, and chsh to update information in the user database, such as user name, password, shell, group affiliation, home directory, etc. When these utilities are executed, certain code paths may invoke separate, external programs in an insecure manner. A local attacker may be able to manipulate the calls to external programs made by chpass/chfn/chsh to execute arbitrary code.  Note that chpass, chfn, and chsh are the same utility. In addition, this utility can execute with administrative privileges, possibly root. Please refer to [Apple Security update 2005-005](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301528) for more information. |
