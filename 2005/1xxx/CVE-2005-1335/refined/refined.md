Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure manner in which the `chpass`, `chfn`, and `chsh` utilities in Apple Mac OS X Directory Services invoke external programs. These utilities are used to update user database information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure External Program Invocation:** The utilities call external programs without proper validation or sanitization of input, making them susceptible to manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker can manipulate the calls to external programs made by `chpass`, `chfn`, and `chsh` to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Since the vulnerable utilities can execute with administrative privileges, possibly root, successful exploitation can lead to elevated privileges, potentially granting the attacker full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
* The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the calls to external programs invoked by the mentioned utilities.

**Additional Notes:**

* The three utilities, `chpass`, `chfn`, and `chsh`, are essentially the same utility and are vulnerable.
* Apple addressed this vulnerability in Security Update 2005-005.
