## Apple Mac OS X with Bluetooth enabled may allow file exchange without prompting users

#### Vulnerability Note VU#258390

Original Release Date: 2005-05-09 | Last Revised: 2005-05-16

---

### Overview

Apple Mac OS X with Bluetooth support may unintentionally allow files to be exchanged with other systems by default.

### Description

| Mac OS X includes support for the [Bluetooth](http://www.apple.com/bluetooth/) networking protocol suite. Bluetooth is a communication technology that enables short-range communication between devices.  The default Bluetooth settings in OS X may allow files to be exchanged with other devices unknowingly. The default location for files that are exchanged may also be used by other applications, resulting in unintended information disclosure. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote attackers may be able to exchange files with a Bluetooth-enabled system running Mac OS X, resulting in unintended information disclosure. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply An Update**Apple has addressed the issue in [Security Update 2005-005](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301528). |
| --- |

| As a workaround, users can manually disable the Bluetooth file sharing service or change the default location used for file transfers. |
