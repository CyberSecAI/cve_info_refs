SQL Injection in CREATE_SCN_CHANGE_SET procedure

AppSecInc Team SHATTER Security Advisory
<http://www.appsecinc.com/resources/alerts/oracle/2005-05.html>
April 18, 2005

Affected versions: Oracle Database Server version 10g

Risk level: High

Credits: This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban
Martínez Fayó of Argeniss for Application Security Inc.

Details:
The CHANGE_SET_NAME parameter of the standard procedure
SYS.DBMS_CDC_IPUBLISH.CREATE_SCN_CHANGE_SET is vulnerable to SQL
injection. This procedure executes with privileges of the SYS user; by
default, PUBLIC has EXECUTE privilege.

Impact:
Any low privileged database user can execute functions with DBA
privileges. Users with privilges to create or modify a function can
inject a user-defined function in the vulnerable procedure and thus
execute SQL statements with DBA privileges.

Workaround:
Revoke Execute privilege on DBMS_CDC_IPUBLISH package.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update April 2005 available at
<http://metalink.oracle.com>
