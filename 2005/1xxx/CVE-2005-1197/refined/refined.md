Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `CHANGE_SET_NAME` parameter of the `SYS.DBMS_CDC_IPUBLISH.CREATE_SCN_CHANGE_SET` procedure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The `CHANGE_SET_NAME` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Privilege Escalation: The vulnerable procedure executes with `SYS` user privileges, which are the highest level of privileges in the Oracle database.
- Publicly Executable Procedure: The `PUBLIC` role has `EXECUTE` privilege on the vulnerable procedure by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A low-privileged database user can execute functions with DBA privileges.
- Attackers can inject user-defined functions into the vulnerable procedure and execute arbitrary SQL statements with `SYS` privileges, potentially leading to complete control of the database.
- Possible sensitive data disclosure, modification or deletion of data.
- Arbitrary code execution on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a SQL injection in the `CHANGE_SET_NAME` parameter of the `SYS.DBMS_CDC_IPUBLISH.CREATE_SCN_CHANGE_SET` procedure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a low-privileged database user.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify a function within the database.
- The attacker must have the ability to execute the vulnerable procedure (`SYS.DBMS_CDC_IPUBLISH.CREATE_SCN_CHANGE_SET`) which is granted by default to the public role.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Oracle Database Server version 10g.
- A patch was released by Oracle in April 2005.
- A workaround includes revoking the `EXECUTE` privilege on the `DBMS_CDC_IPUBLISH` package.
- The vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martínez Fayó of Argeniss for Application Security Inc.
- The CERT advisory also mentions multiple vulnerabilities across other Oracle products beyond the single vulnerability detailed. However, the SQL injection vulnerability in the procedure is not explicitly identified as a separate CVE in the CERT note which covers multiple vulnerabilities identified in the April 2005 Oracle CPU.

This information aligns with the description of CVE-2005-1197 which was a SQL injection vulnerability in the  `CREATE_SCN_CHANGE_SET` procedure of the Oracle DBMS_CDC_IPUBLISH package.
