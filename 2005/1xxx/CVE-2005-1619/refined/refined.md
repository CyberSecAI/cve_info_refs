```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `Charset` and `FontName` parameters in the `start-page.css.php3` and `style.css.php3` files.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not sanitize the user-supplied values for `Charset` and `FontName` parameters which allows an attacker to inject malicious Javascript code.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that could be executed in the victim's browser when they access the chat application's style sheets. This can lead to session hijacking, stealing sensitive data, or other malicious actions.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing the injected JavaScript code in the `Charset` or `FontName` parameters, and then tricking the victim into accessing the crafted URL.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker only needs to be able to craft and distribute a malicious URL. The attacker does not require any special privileges.
