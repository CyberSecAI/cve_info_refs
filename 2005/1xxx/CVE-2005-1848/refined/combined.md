Debian Security Advisory DSA 750-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
July 11th, 2005                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : dhcpcd
Vulnerability  : out-of-bound memory access
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-1848

"infamous42md" discovered that dhcpcd, a DHCP client for automatically
configuring IPv4 networking, can be tricked into reading past the end
of the supplied DHCP buffer which could lead to the daemon crashing.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.22pl4-21sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.22pl4-22.

We recommend that you upgrade your dhcpcd package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
