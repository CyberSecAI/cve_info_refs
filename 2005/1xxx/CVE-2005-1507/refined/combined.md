4d WebSTAR 5.x Mac OS X Buffer Overflow
Author: Braden Thomas
Vendor: <http://www.4d.com>
Product: 4d WebSTAR 5.33 and 5.4 Web Server on Mac OS X
*only trial version tested
Risk: Medium, remote root (unlikely), DoS (likely)
PoC Exploit code included

Description:
     4d WebSTAR 5.x (5.33 and 5.4 tested) contains a buffer overflow
in the Web Server Tomcat plugin.  The plugin is included and active
in a default installation of 4d WebSTAR.  The overflow exists within
the URL.  This overflow can be used for DoS easily, but because 4d
WebSTAR restarts the server process when it crashes, the attacker has
to send a malicious packet about every half second for effective DoS.
     The overflow can also theoretically be used for remote code
execution, but as far as I can tell, the exploit is very improbable.

Details of the exploit:

The buffer is copied byte-by-byte starting from the beginning of the
buffer until a NULL (or a couple other terminating) byte is reached.
However, the pointer that points to the beginning of the buffer
exists just at the edge of the buffer.  Therefore, you will
immediately overflow this pointer after going over the buffer.  Since
you will overflow this pointer MSB-first, the chance is high (if you
aren't careful), that you'll direct the pointer into memory that
either isn't readable, or contains a NULL-pointer, at which point
your overflow will terminate.  My exploit runs in a loop and
continues ad infinitum if the server doesn't crash.

Although the buffer moves around in memory, the pointer is static in
reference to the beginning of the buffer.  So if you guess the
average value for the buffer and put it where the pointer will be
overflowed, you'll get a decent chance of actually successfully
overflowing a valid pointer that actually points within the buffer
(or maybe another copy of the buffer in memory).  In my code this is
defined as BUFADDR, or below as readaddr.

Buffer:
[nops][shellcode][ret addrs][readaddr][more ret addrs]

Once you continue the overflow past the read address pointer, it's
sort of a mystery where in the buffer you will be reading from.
Basically about half of the buffer overflowed consists of return
addresses.  If you thought getting the read address right was tough,
the return address is even harder.  You can actually fill the link
register with this address with a fair accuracy.  This address
*should* return execution back to your buffer to run the shellcode,
but will often crash with EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION somewhere else.  Note
that in the example exploit, the shellcode buffer has been set to all
A's for testing.  Once you get the link register filled (which
happens about 10% of successful overflows), the chance that you
actually hit the shellcode is quite small.  In fact, I've only seen
it happen once or twice.  Good luck.  :)

Code:

/* 4d buffer overflow
Braden Thomas

     the buffer is copied byte by byte starting from the beginning of
the buffer
         until a NULL byte is reached (or a couple other types of bytes)
     the buffer is copied from a pointer that resides past the end of
the buffer
     the buffer can overflow over this pointer, allowing the program
to read bytes to wherever it wants

     -the exploit must restore this pointer or risk reading from null
memory, terminating overflow
     -the pointer is different each time, though it's location in
relation to the buffer is static (buffer+1285)
     -the pointer is overwritten byte by byte, meaning that one wrong
byte, and we're reading from
             somewhere else... which can be potentially bad in terms
of exploitation

     method:
     -exploit attempts to: overwrite the pointer so that the memory
will continue to be overflowed
         (i.e., do not point into any memory that contains a null byte)
     -exploit attempts to continue overflowing with return addresses,
to overflow where LR is stored
     -when loop ends and LR is restored, it will return execution
into the buffer and into shellcode
     -some looping has been added, where BUFADDR is enumerated to try
to brute force the overflow
         because failed servers are respawned

     results:
         actually successful in moving the execution pointer about 10
to 25% of the time
         unsuccessful in actually jumping to the nops/shellcode :(

     problems I don't understand:
         occasionally other threads crash in weird places (memcpy and
szone_malloc)...
             this might actually be when it works as desired and
doesn't crash... but other threads do crash
             before shellcode can do its magic!
             (but that's just a hypothesis)  :)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
