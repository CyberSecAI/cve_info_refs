Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `hyper.cgi` script has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to view sensitive files on the system by manipulating the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `hyper.cgi` script is vulnerable to arbitrary file disclosure, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing the attacker to read files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can read sensitive files, such as `/etc/passwd`, potentially leading to further compromise of the system, such as unauthorized access, or other actions that can severely damage the system and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the path to the sensitive file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the server where `hyper.cgi` is located. No special privileges are required.
