Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in "Terminator 3: War of the Machines":

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A] cd-key hash buffer-overflow:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow occurs in the server due to the way it handles the client's CD-key hash. The server's text field allocated for storing the CD-key hash is not large enough to handle potentially large inputs, leading to the overflow.
    *   **Weakness:**  Insufficient buffer size allocated to store the CD-key hash received from a client.
    *   **Impact:** A remote attacker can potentially cause a server crash or execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted, oversized CD-key hash.
    *  **Attack Vector:**  The attack is launched remotely by sending a specially crafted CD-key hash to the server.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker only needs to connect to the game server and send a crafted cd-key hash.

*   **B] big nickname access violation:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The server crashes when processing an oversized nickname provided by a client.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper bounds checking on the size of the nickname, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access attempt.
    *   **Impact:**  A remote attacker can crash the server by using a nickname that is too long.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is remote by sending the game server an oversized nickname.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker only needs to connect to the game server and use an oversized nickname.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect versions of the game up to and including 1.16.
*   The game is no longer supported, so no official fix is available.
*   The exploit code is available at `http://aluigi.altervista.org/poc/t3wmbof.zip`.

**Summary:**

The analysis reveals two distinct vulnerabilities: a buffer overflow caused by an oversized cd-key hash and an access violation caused by an oversized nickname. Both vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable and can lead to server crashes.

These vulnerabilities can lead to denial of service attacks against game servers, and the buffer overflow could potentially allow for remote code execution.
