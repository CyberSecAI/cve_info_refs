How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Here's quote from upstream's mail:

Here's a new major version of FUSE:

  <http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fuse/fuse-2.3.0.tar.gz>

It contains an important security fix that prevents leaking previous
memory contents to unprivileged users (thanks to Sven Tantau for the
report).  So if you are running a previous version of FUSE on a system
with untrusted users, upgrading is recommended.

Package        : fuse
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-1858
BugTraq ID     : 13857
Debian Bug     : 311634

Sven Tantau discovered a security problem in fuse, a filesystem in
userspace, that can be exploited by malicious, local users to disclose
potentially sensitive information.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the fuse package.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-4sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your fuse package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Hi, thanks for stopping by!

My name is Sven Tantau and I am German by birth, Norwegian by my mom and part-time African by choice.

I started playing with technology at an early age, and gladly my parents always supported this hobby of mine. I really appreciate how many doors it opened for me since then.

If I am not busy on my keyboard, I like to hang out with my friends, [travel](more.html#travel) and spend quality time with my ~~girlfriend~~ wife.

I am very proud and happy to be a co-founder of [nebenan.de](https://nebenan.de/), where I had 5 years the privilege to work with an awesome team to bring neighbors a bit closer together.
Currently I am working as co-founder of the gut.org invest GmbH with an equally awesome team to make impact investing easier. [bcause.com](https://bcause.com/)

Below is more information on the ~~services I offer~~ (currently not available!) and the projects I have been doing.

If you have any questions or just want to talk about tech-stuff,
please do not hesitate to [contact me](#contact).

Cheers!

###### what I do

### Software Development

I had my first job as a programmer in 1998 building perl based websites. Since then I have worked on many applications, ranging from simple content management systems over community software to ERP systems and business process automation.
I also enjoy to work on mobile phones or writing software for your startup.

![](images/development.jpg "toying with the planet pbx")

### Systems Integration and Telecommunications

Working for and with multiple internet service providers I had the opportunity to build and migrate WiMAX networks, write and deploy various services and play with expensive hardware. With a preference for open source software I help companies to customize available solutions to their needs and make existing components work together.

![](images/5.jpg "vsat angola")

### Security Consulting

I also offer security consulting with focus on web applications and general information security. I have discovered security problems in web applications, kernel modules, as well as in consumer software like ebook readers or video players. I also reverse engineered firmware to break authentication methods and hunted for backdoors.

On the defending side I've build and integrated firewalls, IDS or NACs like packetfence.

![](images/fingerprint.jpg "fingerprint reader")

###### Some Keywords

#### Programming Languages:

At the moment I get most work done with ruby, perl, javascript or c.

But I've also worked with java, objective c, x86 asm or scripting languages like php, python, basic dialects or query languages.

Yes, I do automated testing; I use version control and I love CI.

#### Operating systems:

Linux preferred. Accidental knowledge about Windows, BSD and Mac. I also picked up some cisco skills along the way.

#### Software I've setup, used and maintained:

Postgresql, MySQL/MariaDB, IBM-DB2

Apache, Lighttpd, nginx, HaProxy

Postfix, Exim, Courier

Freeradius, Radiator, Samba, Squid, cvs, svn, git, dhcpd, nfs, pppoe, asterisk, openfire, rrdtool, zabbix, snort, packetfence...

Many proprietary NMS systems like snmpc, other monitoring solutions, firewalls, more or less everything you would find inside an ancient or modern ISP.

#### Hardware:

Experience with smart card programming.

Radio systems from multiple vendors like Alvarion/Telrad, Airspan, Ceragon. WiMAX, Microwave, VSAT installations.
And some mobile devices.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
