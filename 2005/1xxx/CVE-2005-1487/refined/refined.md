Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2005-1487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in FishCart 3.1, specifically when handling user-supplied data before using it in SQL queries or displaying it on web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist because the application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities are present because the application does not properly sanitize user input before displaying it on web pages, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Attackers could potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database.
    *   They could also bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    *   In some cases, it could lead to complete compromise of the application and/or server.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, phishing attacks, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   The attacker can potentially steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET parameters:** The vulnerabilities are exploited through maliciously crafted HTTP GET parameters in the following files:
    *   `display.php` (both SQL injection and XSS)
    *  `upstnt.php` (SQL Injection)
    *  `upstracking.php` (XSS)
*   By inserting SQL code into parameters such as `nlst`,  and `cartid` in  `display.php`, an attacker triggers SQL injection.
*   By injecting JavaScript code into parameters such as `nlst` in `display.php` or `trackingnum` and `reqagree` in `upstracking.php`, an attacker triggers XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges or internal access is required, only the ability to access the application through the web.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides specific proof-of-concept URLs demonstrating the SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   It also suggests fixes including using  `htmlspecialchars()`, `mysql_escape_string()`, `mysql_real_escape_string()` (or equivalent functions) for input sanitization before using user data in database queries or outputting to the browser.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerabilities were found by a researcher named Diabolic Crab.
