Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The `read.php` script in OpenBB does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `TID` parameter.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists in `read.php`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, possibly leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `read.php` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `TID` parameter. Example: `http://www.example.com/openbb/read.php?TID=>'`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `member.php` script does not properly sanitize the `reverse` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected XSS vulnerability exists in `member.php`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious client-side scripts into the page that would be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `member.php` with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `reverse` parameter. Example: `http://www.example.com/member.php?action=list&page=2&sortorder=username&perpage=25&reverse=>"><script>alert('test');</script>`
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content gives a proof-of-concept for both vulnerabilities that is more specific than the generic description in the CVE.
*   The vulnerable software version is Open Bulletin Board 1.0.8.
