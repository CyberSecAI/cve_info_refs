      "type": "RELEVANT",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the misuse of `JS_GetPrivate` calls in `nsJSInstallTriggerGlobal.cpp`. These calls were used in methods that could be invoked on unrelated `|this|` object types. The correct API to use was `JS_GetInstancePrivate`.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect usage of JS API functions leading to type confusion.",
          "Lack of proper validation of object types in JavaScript native implementations."
        ],
        "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to crashes due to the JavaScript interpreter jumping to incorrect memory locations. It was also believed that the vulnerability was reliably exploitable and could lead to arbitrary code execution due to the manipulation of raw C pointers. Memory disclosure was also observed using `toSource()`.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `InstallTrigger.install` function with an invalid object (e.g. a number) as the `this` parameter.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in the context of a vulnerable browser. This could be achieved through a malicious website."
