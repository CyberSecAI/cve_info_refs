Summary of changes from v2.6.11.7 to v2.6.11.8
==============================================
[PATCH] [fix Bug 4395] modprobe bttv freezes the computer
Here's a patch that fixes
http://bugme.osdl.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=4395.
Patch by Manu Abraham and Gerd Knorr:
Remove redundant bttv\_reset\_audio() which caused the computer to
freeze with some bt8xx based DVB cards when loading the bttv driver.

[PATCH] I2C: Fix incorrect sysfs file permissions in it87 and via686a drivers
The it87 and via686a hardware monitoring drivers each create a sysfs
file named "alarms" in R/W mode, while they should really create it in
read-only mode. Since we don't provide a store function for these files,
write attempts to these files will do something undefined (I guess) and
bad (I am sure). My own try resulted in a locked terminal (where I
attempted the write) and a 100% CPU load until next reboot.
As a side note, wouldn't it make sense to check, when creating sysfs
files, that readable files have a non-NULL show method, and writable
files have a non-NULL store method? I know drivers are not supposed to
do stupid things, but there is already a BUG\_ON for several conditions
in sysfs\_create\_file, so maybe we could add two more?

This was fixed post-2.6.11. Can you confirm that 2.6.12-rc2 works OK?
This is the patch we used. It should go into -stable if it's not already
there.
From: Alexander Nyberg
I looked at some of the oops reports against keyrings, I think the problem
is that the search isn't restarted after dropping the key\_user\_lock, \*p
will still be NULL when we get back to try\_again and look through the tree.
It looks like the intention was that the search start over from scratch.

[PATCH] uml: quick fix syscall table
I'm resending this for inclusion in the -stable tree. I've deleted whitespace
cleanups, and hope this can be merged. I've been asked to split the former
patch, I don't know if I must split again this one, even because I don't want
to split this correct patch into multiple non-correct ones by mistake.
Uml 2.6.11 does not compile with gcc 2.95.4 because some entries are
duplicated, and that GCC does not accept this (unlike gcc 3). Plus various
other bugs in the syscall table definitions, resulting in probable wrong
syscall entries:
\*) 223 is a syscall hole (i.e. ni\_syscall) only on i386, on x86\_64 it's a
valid syscall (thus a duplicated one).
\*) \_\_NR\_vserver must be only once with sys\_ni\_syscall, and not multiple
times with different values!
\*) syscalls duplicated in SUBARCHs and in common files (thus assigning twice
to the same array entry and causing the GCC 2.95.4 failure mentioned above):
sys\_utimes, which is common, and sys\_fadvise64\_64, sys\_statfs64,
sys\_fstatfs64, which exist only on i386.
\*) syscalls duplicated in each SUBARCH, to put in common files:
sys\_remap\_file\_pages, sys\_utimes, sys\_fadvise64
\*) 285 is a syscall hole (i.e. ni\_syscall) only on i386, on x86\_64 the range
does not arrive to that point.
\*) on x86\_64, the macro name is \_\_NR\_kexec\_load and not \_\_NR\_sys\_kexec\_load.
Use the correct name in either case.
Note: as you can see, part of the syscall table definition in UML is
arch-independent (with everywhere defined syscalls), and part is
arch-dependant. This has created confusion (some syscalls are listed in both
places, some in the wrong one, some are wrong on one arch or another).

[PATCH] sparc: Fix PTRACE\_CONT bogosity
SunOS aparently had this weird PTRACE\_CONT semantic which
we copied. If the addr argument is something other than
1, it sets the process program counter to whatever that
value is.
This is different from every other Linux architecture, which
don't do anything with the addr and data args.
This difference in particular breaks the Linux native GDB support
for fork and vfork tracing on sparc and sparc64.
There is no interest in running SunOS binaries using this weird
PTRACE\_CONT behavior, so just delete it so we behave like other
platforms do.

[PATCH] sparc64: Fix copy\_sigingo\_to\_user32()
From: jurij@wooyd.org
Because this routine was not filling in the siginfo
values for si\_band and si\_fd, this broke applications
trying to actually get at this data.
This makes the sparc64 code in line with PowerPC64's
implementation, which already gets it right.

[PATCH] : sparc64: use message queue compat syscalls
A couple message queue system call entries for compat tasks
were not using the necessary compat\_sys\_\*() functions, causing
some glibc test cases to fail.
