Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Pico Server (pServ) v3.3:

**1) Directory Traversal:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the directory parsing code where the `depthCount` variable is manipulated. It's decreased when `/../` is encountered, as expected, but incorrectly increased when `/./` is encountered.
*   **Weakness:** Inadequate input validation when processing directory paths.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can access any directory the server has access to. This allows the attacker to potentially gain sensitive system information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted URL with combinations of `/../` and `/./` to navigate outside the intended web root directory.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send an HTTP request to the server.
*   **Proof of Concept:** `<http://www.example.com/./../>`

**2) Remote Command Execution:**

*   **Root Cause:** This vulnerability is a consequence of the directory traversal vulnerability. Because an attacker can traverse directories, they can reach the `cgi-bin` directory. pServ treats any request starting with `/cgi-bin/` as a script to be executed.
*   **Weakness:** Combining a directory traversal weakness with the server's logic for executing CGI scripts creates an exploitable vulnerability.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to data destruction or further attacks, including the download of root exploits.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted URL that includes `/cgi-bin/`, directory traversal characters, and the path to the desired command to execute.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send an HTTP request to the server.
*   **Proof of Concept:** `<http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/./.././../usr/bin/ls>`

**3) Multiple Heap Overflows in CGI Execution:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper bounds checking when handling CGI arguments.
*   **Weakness:** The server allocates a fixed-size buffer (MAX_PATH_LEN, typically 128 bytes on Linux) for each CGI argument, but there is no limit on the size of the arguments sent by the attacker, beyond the maximum request length (2048).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can overflow the allocated memory, potentially allowing for remote code execution.
*  **Attack Vector:** Sending an HTTP request with CGI arguments that exceed the size of the allocated buffer.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send an HTTP request to the server with sufficiently large arguments.
*   **Details:** The allocated buffer has a size of `MAX_PATH_LEN` (128 on Linux), while the attacker's argument is only limited by the maximum request length (2048)

**Mitigations:**

*   The main solution is to upgrade to v3.4 of Pico Server.
*   A workaround for the remote command execution and heap overflow vulnerabilities is to disable CGI support at compile time.
