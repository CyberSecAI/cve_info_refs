# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200504-15**

Several vulnerabilities were found and fixed in PHP image handling
functions, potentially resulting in Denial of Service conditions or the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-php/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3.11** |

| Package | **dev-php/mod\_php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3.11** |

| Package | **dev-php/php-cgi** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3.11** |

### Background

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language widely used to develop
web-based applications. It can run inside a web server using the
mod\_php module or the CGI version of PHP, or can run stand-alone in a
CLI.

### Description

An integer overflow and an unbound recursion were discovered in
the processing of Image File Directory tags in PHP's EXIF module
(CAN-2005-1042, CAN-2005-1043). Furthermore, two infinite loops have
been discovered in the getimagesize() function when processing IFF or
JPEG images (CAN-2005-0524, CAN-2005-0525).

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft an image file with a malicious EXIF
IFD tag, a large IFD nesting level or invalid size parameters and send
it to a web application that would process this user-provided image
using one of the affected functions. This could result in denying
service on the attacked server and potentially executing arbitrary code
with the rights of the web server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/php-4.3.11"
```

All mod\_php users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/mod_php-4.3.11"
```

All php-cgi users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/php-cgi-4.3.11"
```
