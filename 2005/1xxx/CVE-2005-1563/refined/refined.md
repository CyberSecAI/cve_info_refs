Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-1563:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Incomplete validation of user permissions when accessing products within Bugzilla. Specifically, the `CanEnterProduct()` function did not properly check the `disallownew` flag, which controls whether new bugs can be entered for a specific product, and did not handle componentless products.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Leak:** By guessing product names, an attacker could discover the existence of products they should not have access to. The system would explicitly inform them that they lack access, thus confirming the product's existence.
    *   **Improper Access Control:** Attackers could submit bugs to products that were closed for new bug entries if they knew the product's name and bypassed the normal UI flow.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Exposure of private product/component names, which could be considered sensitive in commercial environments.
    *   Ability to create unwanted bug reports in products that should be closed for such actions, potentially disrupting workflows and adding noise.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct manipulation of URLs:** By manually crafting URLs to `enter_bug.cgi` or `post_bug.cgi`, an attacker could bypass checks done through the web UI.
    *  **Form tampering:** Saving the enter_bug.cgi form locally, modifying parameters, and submitting.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Bugzilla system.
    *   The attacker has to know or guess the names of private or closed products.

**Technical Details from Bugzilla Bug Report:**

*   The `CanEnterProduct()` function was intended to check if a user could enter bugs into a specific product, but it only partially fulfilled its purpose.
*   The issue was present because `CanEnterProduct()` did not check the `disallownew` flag, which is used to disable bug submissions for particular products.
*   `process_bug.cgi` was also affected because it only called `CanEnterProduct()` without additional checks.
*   The fix involved:
    *   Modifying `CanEnterProduct()` to properly check the `disallownew` flag and consider the presence of components for a product.
    *   Creating a new function `CanEnterProductOrWarn()` that provides specific error messages based on why access is denied: the product does not exist, it is disabled, or it lacks components.
    *   Updating `enter_bug.cgi`, `post_bug.cgi`, and `process_bug.cgi` to use `CanEnterProductOrWarn()` and properly handle the different cases of access denial.
    *   Error messages were modified to be more informative, but also to avoid exposing information about product existence to unauthorized users.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report ([https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=287109](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=287109)) provides a detailed account of the bug, the fixes applied, and the discussions between developers.
*   The fix was backported to Bugzilla versions 2.16, 2.18, and 2.19.
