How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

|  | |

\*\*\* Please do not remove the security flag till we have clearly identified if
there are "real" security holes \*\*\*
Per discussion with justdave in IRC, it appears that some validation functions
have confusing name or do incomplete validation.
Two examples:
1. In enter\_bug.cgi, CanEnterProduct() is called to "check and make sure that
the user has permission to enter a bug against this product." (comment taken
from that file, line 293). Based on this statement, I removed an additional
check as part of [bug 282267](/show_bug.cgi?id=282267 "RESOLVED FIXED - product name is checked twice in enter_bug.cgi"), because I thought CanEnterProduct() and
lsearch(\@::enterable\_products, $product) == -1 were both doing the same job. It
appears that it is \*not\* the case!! So the validation done by CanEnterProduct()
is incomplete, as it should also check the 'disallownew' bit.
2. Independently of my "mistake" about this validation in enter\_bug.cgi, it's
still possible to enter bugs in "closed" products by hacking the URL given to
post\_bug.cgi as this file "only" calls CanEnterProduct()! I can reproduce this
on both 2.18 and 2.20 (I haven't tested with 2.16).
There are several functions (in globals.pl) with similar names: CanEnterProduct,
GetEnterableProducts and GetSelectableProducts for example. But they do not seem
to do what they really should do and some of them seem to be incorrectly used.
Coming back to my previous examples 1. and 2., CanEnterProduct() should consider
the 'disallownew' bit. There may be more...
Before releasing any new version, we should make sure that everything is ok...

CanEnterProduct should just use @::enterable\_products, and should call
GetVersionTable to make sure that that variable exists.

(22:14:31) joel: Yes... if you want to get rid of the versioncache thing (die
versioncache!!), you need to have GetEnterableProducts take that into account

If the situation is as you describe, it means that (if they know the names of
them) attackers can enter bugs in products they shouldn't be able to. While a
nuisance, this doesn't give them access to any confidential information, does it?

You are correct... about post\_bug.cgi. The security flag is set till we are sure
such functions are not misused in other files, such as show\_bug.cgi.

IIUC, the problem is post\_bug is that a product could be "closed for bug entry,"
but still accessible and a user who could have entered a bug in that product had
it been open could still enter a bug.
That doesn't make it as a security problem in my book.
---------------
HOWEVER -- In show\_bug.cgi, the history of comments IS AVAILABLE even if the bug
is not, so long as we are in the "long format" mode. So, if you hack form data,
you CAN get the comments. ValidateBugID() is only called for a single bug.
Try this...
Search for a bunch of bugs, some non-public.
Click on LONG FORMAT
see results
select one bug, view it, and log out
back up to the LONG FORMAT listing and hit reload...

Component names might be confidential in commercial products.

For the record since nobody actually mentioned it here, that was filed
separately as [bug 287880](/show_bug.cgi?id=287880 "RESOLVED FIXED - Comments on secure bugs still available to templates... show_bug leaks") and has already been fixed.

Nit: submit new bugs in -> enter bugs into

Note that DBI's documentation suggests exercising caution when using
selectrow\_array in a scalar context. It doesn't seem there's any reason to do
it in this case, so it'd be better to do:
my ($allow\_new\_bugs) = $dbh->selectrow\_array(...);
However, you could also do this more simply with an inner join and using scalar
context:
my $allow\_new\_bugs =
$dbh->selectrow\_array("SELECT CASE WHEN disallownew = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0
END
FROM products JOIN components
ON components.product\_id = products.id
WHERE products.name = ? " .
$dbh->sql\_limit(1),
undef, $productname);
Then, $allow\_new\_bugs would contain 1 if disallownew = 0 and there are any
components, 0 if disallownew = 1 and there are any components, and undef (which
equals 0) if there are no components.
In testing: without the patch, I can enter bugs into disabled products, but I
can't enter bugs into componentless products. When I try to enter a bug into a
componentless product by hacking the URL to enter\_bug.cgi, switching the
product parameter from a valid product to the componentless product, I get:
Sorry; there needs to be at least one component for this product
in order to create a new bug. Create a new component.
When I try to do so by saving the enter\_bug.cgi form locally and hacking it, I
get the following whether or not I specify a component:
To file this bug, you must first choose a component.

With the patch, I can't enter bugs into either kind of product. Whether I hack
the URL or the form, both kinds of products give me the error:
Sorry, either the product PRODUCTNAME does not exist, or you don't have the
required permissions to enter a bug against that product.
So the fix does prevent me from entering bugs into products I shouldn't be
entering them into. But in the process it makes the error message for
componentless products worse. We need to give users accurate information about
why they can't enter bugs into products instead of just telling them they don't
have permission to do so.
The message for disabled products should be:
Sorry, entering bugs into product PRODUCTNAME has been disabled.
For componentless products, it's:
Sorry, product PRODUCTNAME needs to have at least one component
before you can enter bugs into it. Create a new component.

Note that DBI's documentation suggests exercising caution when using
selectrow\_array in a scalar context. It doesn't seem there's any reason to do
it in this case, so it'd be better to do:
my ($allow\_new\_bugs) = $dbh->selectrow\_array(...);
However, you could also do this more simply with an inner join and using scalar
context:
my $allow\_new\_bugs =
$dbh->selectrow\_array("SELECT CASE WHEN disallownew = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0
END
FROM products JOIN components
ON components.product\_id = products.id
WHERE products.name = ? " .
$dbh->sql\_limit(1),
undef, $productname);
Then, $allow\_new\_bugs would contain 1 if disallownew = 0 and there are any
components, 0 if disallownew = 1 and there are any components, and undef (which
equals 0) if there are no components.
In testing: without the patch, I can enter bugs into disabled products, but I
can't enter bugs into componentless products. When I try to enter a bug into a
componentless product by hacking the URL to enter\_bug.cgi, switching the
product parameter from a valid product to the componentless product, I get:
Sorry; there needs to be at least one component for this product
in order to create a new bug. Create a new component.
When I try to do so by saving the enter\_bug.cgi form locally and hacking it, I
get the following whether or not I specify a component:
To file this bug, you must first choose a component.
If necessary, just guess.

I disagree! We said several times the user should not know if a product does not
exist or if it has restrictions on who can enter bugs into. Applying this idea
to disabled products or products without components, I think we should not give
the exact reason why the user cannot access this product... or am I missing
something? Any opinion guys?

Here's what I said on IRC when LpSolit asked me about this:
<justdave\_> LpSolit: Myk is correct.
<justdave\_> As long as the user would otherwise be able to see the product
<LpSolit> justdave\_: so you want to display some "confidential" information?
<justdave\_> they should get an accurate reason why they can't enter in it.
<justdave\_> neither of those are confidential situations
<justdave\_> he's talking about if the user can already see the product, but the
product has been disabled or hasn't had components created yet.
<justdave\_> that's completely different from if the product doesn't exist of if
the user doesn't have access to the product.
<justdave\_> A user not having access to a product should be treated as if the
product doesn't exist
<justdave\_> (or give an ambiguous message indicating that either is possible)
<justdave\_> "doesn't exist or you don't have access to it"
<justdave\_> if the user DOES have access to the product, but the product has
been closed for entry or there are not components defined in it, then there's no
reason to hide that from the user, as they can already see it anyway.
<justdave\_> whether the user has access to the product should be checked prior
to checking for closed or no components though.

What you ask me to do is a pain. CanEnterProduct() has to reject a request
returning an appropriate value based on the following cases:
1) the user cannot enter the product
2) the product is closed for new bug entry
3) the product has no component
Most developers use "if (CanEnterProduct($product))" so that we should be
careful on the value returned by this function. I see only two possible values:
0 and undef, meaning that I cannot distinguish more than two cases. :(
Another possibility is to use an intermediate function CanEnterProductOrWarn()
which would return an appropriate error message based on the value returned by
CanEnterProduct(), assuming it can returned any value, for example -1 for no
access, 0 for a closed product and undef for a product with no component. But
then, we would need to change the logic in the whole code, replacing "if
(CanEnterProduct($product))" by "if (CanEnterProduct($product)) > 0". Is that a
safe solution? I'm not sure!
Any better idea?

It's really a pain!!! When moving a bug to a different product, Bugzilla asks
you to choose the component, the version and the target\_milestone independently
whether or not the product has group restrictions or is closed for bugs entry!!!

2.16 backport patch v1,2. like v1.1 except it tests in process\_bug.cgi that a
bug is not being moved to a product which is closed for bug entry. The
placement of the test here is tricky. We don't want to leak version and
component names of a product to a user who is not entitled to see that product.
So we test \*before\* showing the version/component selection dropdowns.
However, we test by calling CanEnterProductOrWarn(). What if usebuggroupsentry
is not set but usebuggroups is set, and the user isn't in the necessary group?
Should such a user be allowed to move bugs into the product? What's the desired
semantics?

I'm having some difficulty testing this on 2.16.8 as I don't have a concrete
list of use cases and the desired outcome, for all the affected code. This v1.3
patch seems to work for the tests which I have devised so far.

Your version 1.3 of the 2.16 backport does not consider the fact that all bugs
could already be in the product we are moving to and you would then generate a
useless (and incorrect) error message. I'm waiting for joel's and myk's review
of the v3 patch before backporting it to 2.18 and 2.16.

Well, it does consider that fact. It documents in the comment that it doesn't
handle it well.
The only alternative is to iterate through the bug IDs getting their current
products, before potentially asking CanEnterProductOrWarn. I'm happy to write
that code, if we decide it's indicated. But it'll make this a bigger patch, and
we should endeavour to keep it small for a security fix to a maintenance branch.

Huh? Please read my last patch first. I already fixed that problem.

There is no need to be two developers on this bug. This one is already assigned
to me and I feel able to fix it without any help. But thanks for proposing your
help! You can help by reviewing the 2.16 patch as soon as I upload a new one. :)

I have no 2.16 installation, so I cannot test this patch, except running
runtests.pl, which does not complain. Table fields have changed a lot between
2.16 and 2.19 so I may be wrong here. This patch \*really\* needs to be tested.
Nick, could you do some tests for 2.16? I just realized that you did not test
previous 2.16 patches, even yours, because there are invalid field names in
them and any trivial test would have failed immediately. ;)

A basic set of tests for these fixes are to create componentless, disabled, and
confidential products and then try to load enter\_bug.cgi and post\_bug.cgi,
specifying those products, both before and after applying the patch.
I ran such tests on 2.18 and 2.16 installations and got the attached results.

Nit: writing the comment this way is a little easier to read:
>+# This function determines whether or not a user can enter bugs
>+# into the named product.
(Putting the line break between the phrases "a user can enter bugs" and "into
the named product" makes the comment easier to read than putting it within the
phrase "can enter bugs".)

Nit: better as "my ($check\_can\_enter) = ...".
Nit: the message for componentless products should be "Sorry, the product
<product> has to have at least one component in order for you to enter a bug
into it. Please contact <maintainer> and ask them to add a component to this
product."
Nit: the message for disabled products should be "Sorry, entering bugs into the
product <product> has been disabled." (adding the word "the"--yes, I realize I
missed this on the trunk review)
Nit: the message for confidential products should be "Sorry, either the product
<product> does not exist or you aren't authorized to enter a bug into that
product."

Seems like this works, and 2.16 is virtually EOLed anyway, so it probably
doesn't matter, but is there a particular reason you combined the work done by
both CanEnterProduct and CanEnterProductOrWarn in other patches into a single
function in this patch? It seems like unnecessarily divergent code paths.

Nit: though I don't think it'll cause problems in this particular case, queries
in subroutines that don't push and pop the global SQL state run the risk of
corrupting a query done outside the subroutine whose data has not been fully
retrieved when the subroutine gets called. You should push and pop the global
SQL state around these statements.
Message nits from the 2.18 patch apply here as well.
Otherwise, the code looks good and the tests all come up smelling like roses.

Unfortunately, the patch author isn't around to do these checkins, and I don't
feel comfortable addressing the message nits on my personal checkin. Perhaps we
should have another bug marked as "trivial" for dealing with them.

mkanat, yes. That's what I had in mind. Don't worry for that. :)

2.16 backport, v2
This really seems to break something in bugzilla 2.16. enter\_bug.cgi now gives
me always an error saying that I'm not alowed to access the component while I
do have a component.

2.16 backport, v2
This should actually still be r+, since it passed review, and the review was
myk's. I talked to sukria about it on IRC.
If we do find a problem with this patch... we'll probably have to open anohther
bug and pull 2.16.9 if possible.

Just for the record, I confirm that the bug still appears with a 2.16.9 tarball.
The problem really seems to come from the fact that I use a database wich was
created for a 2.16.7 system. Maybe something is missing somewhere... (running
checksetup.pl did not help)

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers two security bugs that have recently been
discovered and fixed in the Bugzilla code:

+ In all versions of Bugzilla since at least 2.16, it is possible
  to guess the name of a hidden product and have Bugzilla confirm that
  you were correct.
+ In Bugzilla 2.18 and above, a user's username and password are
  sometimes exposed in the URL after generating a Report.

All Bugzilla installations are advised to upgrade to the latest stable
version of Bugzilla, 2.18.1.

Development snapshots of 2.19 and above are also vulnerable. If you are
using a development snapshot, you should obtain a newer one (2.19.3)
or use CVS to update or apply the patches from the specific bugs listed
below.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
-------
Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.10 through 2.18, 2.19.1, 2.19.2
Description: If a user correctly guesses the name of a product that
             should be invisible to them, they will be specifically
             informed that they do not have access to it, thus letting
             them know that the product exists.
             Also, users can enter bugs into products that are closed for
             bug entry, if they correctly guess the name of the product.
Reference:   <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=287109>

Issue 2
-------
Class:       User Password Embedded in URL
Versions:    2.17.1 through 2.18, 2.19.1, 2.19.2
Description: The user's password can be embedded as part of a report URL,
             and thus visible in the web server logs, if the user is
             prompted to log in while attempting to view a chart.
Reference:   <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=287436>

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fixes for all of the security bugs mentioned in this advisory
are included in the 2.16.9, 2.18.1, and 2.19.3 releases.  Upgrading
to these releases will protect installations from possible exploits
of these issues.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and CVS upgrade instructions are available at:
