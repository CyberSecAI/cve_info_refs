| [Description](#c0)  Romang    2005-05-24 04:27:02 UTC  ``` Hello,  During the drop off a database, xmysqladmin dropt the database and create a tar.gz inside /tmp without checking if the file exist already.  void dropdb_drop(FL_OBJECT *obj, long data) {   char *cmd;    if(!fl_show_question("WARNING!!!\nThis database will be delete.\nDo you want to continue?", 0))         return;   if(!fl_show_question("WARNING!!!\nThis database will be delete.\nAre you sure?", 0))         return;    cmd = (char *) malloc(2048);   if(!cmd) return;    sprintf(cmd, "%s %s/%s.tar%s %s%s/*", BACKUP, BACKUPDIR, g_dropdb_dbfname,           BACKUPSUFFIX, Setup.datapath, g_dropdb_dbfname);    fl_show_command_log(FL_TRANSIENT);   fl_exe_command(cmd, 1);   free(cmd);    {     MYSQL connection;     if(g_mysql_connect(&connection, Setup.host, Setup.user, Setup.password))     {       if(mysql_drop_db(&connection, g_dropdb_dbfname))         {           fl_show_alert(mysql_error(&connection),"","",0);         }       else         {           fl_show_message("The database",g_dropdb_dbfname,"has been destroyed");         }        mysql_close(&connection);     }     else       {           fl_show_alert("Cannot connect to server","","",0);       }   }  Possible to overwrite arbitrary files or get the content off the database.  Maybe more bugs into this soft ;)  Regards. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-05-29 01:15:51 UTC  ``` Yes, perhaps BACKUPDIR could be set to "." in the Makefile? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Romang    2005-05-29 07:51:27 UTC  ``` Hello,  Yes it's a solution. If the . directory is not world writable. Upstream should find another solution.  I contact him, and propose him the . solution.  Regards. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Romang    2005-06-06 01:22:34 UTC  ``` Hello,  No upstream response.  Regards. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-09 09:37:39 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 95571](show_bug.cgi?id=95571 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - dev-db/xmysqladmin: Insecure Temporary File Creation") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-09 09:38:17 UTC  ``` public ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-24 05:56:43 UTC  ``` So we need to patch the Makefile (or remove the package) since upstream is silent.  No maintainer... mysql herd, do you feel like taking this one ? rphillips: you're the only survivor in the old committers, let us know if you accept to patch again.  I guess we'll have to mask/remove it if noone wants it. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Francesco R. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-27 01:38:27 UTC  ``` Koon: can you hard mask it in my place please ? Waiting approval from herd lead to remove it.  ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-06-27 01:57:39 UTC  ``` Package masked on vivo's request. Bug kept open until complete removal. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Robin Johnson   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2005-08-17 17:25:59 UTC  ``` I don't agree that this is insecure temp file creation. the permissions of the created file in /tmp are 644.  sure the design decision of creating /tmp/foo.tar.gz without checkign that it already exists isn't great, but it's not bad given that xmysqladmin is run with user permissions. it fails if the user doesn't have permissions to write there, provided your /tmp is set up correctly with the sticky bit.  It looks like it should be acceptable to set umask(0077) before running tar. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-22 12:41:27 UTC  ``` Any news on this one? ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Luca Longinotti (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-16 13:09:15 UTC  ``` MySQL herd doesn't really want to maintain this, since it's p.masked since a long time, I'd go for removal. If none speaks up, I'll send the last rites email tomorrow, and remove from the tree two weeks after that. Best regards, CHTEKK. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Luca Longinotti (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-08-26 15:43:55 UTC  ``` Removed from Portage. Best regards, CHTEKK. ``` |  |
