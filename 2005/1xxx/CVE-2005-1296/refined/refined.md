Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `include.cgi` script is vulnerable due to insufficient input sanitization. It directly includes user-supplied input as part of a file path or executes it as a command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The script allows attackers to specify a file path, leading to the inclusion of sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`
- **Remote Command Execution:** The script executes commands specified by the user, making remote code execution possible.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The script reflects user-supplied input without proper encoding allowing XSS attacks, as demonstrated by the example involving `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd` can be exposed.
- **System Compromise:** Remote command execution allows attackers to gain complete control over the server.
- **User Compromise:** XSS could allow an attacker to steal cookies, redirect to malicious sites, or perform other client-side attacks on users who visit a vulnerable page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to the `include.cgi` script with a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior access is needed.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the `include.cgi` script
