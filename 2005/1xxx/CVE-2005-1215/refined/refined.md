  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-1215",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way ISA Server 2000 handles malformed HTTP requests with multiple content-length headers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of malformed HTTP requests",
        "Cache poisoning vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to poison the cache of the affected ISA server. This could result in bypassing content restrictions and accessing restricted content or redirecting users to unexpected content. Additionally, it could be used in combination with a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability to obtain sensitive information, such as logon credentials.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Constructing a malicious HTTP request and sending it to an affected ISA server"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a malformed HTTP request to an ISA server configured to publish a web server or proxy web content.  The source of the attack would determine the scope of the affected clients. An attacker would need to submit the malicious request before the valid version of the page is cached."
