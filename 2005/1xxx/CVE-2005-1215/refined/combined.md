## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in each âVulnerability Detailsâ sections of this bulletin, this update includes a change in functionality: A Basic Credentials issue as addressed originally in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 821724](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/821724) was reintroduced after installing [MS04-039](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms04-039), a fix for this issue has been included in this update and the referenced KB article has been updated to reflect this change.

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

No. MBSA does not support ISA Server, and will not detect whether the update is required for that program. However, Microsoft has developed a version of the [Enterprise Update Scanning Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) (EST) that will help customers determine if this security update is required.
For detailed information about the programs that MBSA currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**What is the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, [detailed documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For more information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). For more detailed deployment information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894192). There is also a version of this tool that SMS customers can obtain by visiting the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154). This tool may also be available for SMS customers from the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.
However, there is a version of the EST that SMS customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators from the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894194).

The Security Update Inventory Tool is required for detecting Microsoft Windows and other affected Microsoft products. For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460)

For more information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

You can deploy this update by using the [Inventory and Software Distribution](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33333) feature of SMS.

## Vulnerability Details

#### HTTP Content Header Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1215:

A vulnerability exists in ISA Server 2000 because of the way that it handles malformed HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious HTTP request that could potentially allow an attacker to poison the cache of the affected ISA server. As a result, the attacker could either bypass content restrictions and access content that they would normally not have access to or they could cause users to be directed to unexpected content. Additionally, an attacker could use this in combination with a separate Cross Site Scripting vulnerability to obtain sensitive information such as logon credentials.

#### Mitigating Factors for HTTP Content Header Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1215:

* An attacker would only be able to poison the cache with existing content from the IP address or domain name of the targeted server
* Due to the way that caching works, an attacker would need to be able to submit a malicious request before a valid version of the page is cached via another method, either user or automatically invoked.
* ISA Servers that are configured in Firewall Mode are not vulnerable to this issue.
* Typical usage of Internet Explorer will not produce malformed HTTP requests.

#### Workarounds for HTTP Content Header Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1215:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for HTTP Content Header Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1215:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could either bypass content restrictions and access content that they would normally not have access to or they could cause users to be directed to unexpected content. Additionally, an attacker could use this in conjunction with a separate Cross Site Scripting vulnerability to obtain sensitive information such as logon credentials.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process used by ISA Server to handle multiple HTTP content length headers.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could poison the ISA cache or bypass content restriction policies.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

In order to attempt to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send a malformed http request packet to an ISA Server which has been either configured to publish a web server or proxy web content. The source of the attack would determine the scope of the affected clients. In a web publishing scenario, clients attempting to view the contents of the published Web Site could be directed to unexpected content. In a web caching configuration, clients could be directed to unexpected content from external web content previously cached.

**What is ISA Server 2000?**

ISA Server 2000 provides an enterprise firewall and a high-performance Web cache. The firewall helps protect the network by regulating which resources can be accessed through the firewall, and under what conditions. The Web cache helps improve network performance by storing local copies of frequently-requested Web content. ISA Server can be installed in three modes: firewall mode, cache mode, and integrated mode.Firewall mode allows an administrator to secure network communication by configuring rules that control communication between the corporate network and the Internet. Cache mode improves network performance by storing frequently-accessed Web pages on the server. In integrated mode, all cache and firewall features are available.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted HTTP request packet and sending the packet to an affected ISA Server.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

ISA Servers that are configured to cache Web requests or to publish Web servers.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that ISA Server handles HTTP request packets that have multiple content-length headers.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. However, it had not been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number. This type of vulnerability has also been named âHTTP Smugglingâ by the larger security community.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### NetBIOS Predefined Filter Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1216:

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in ISA Server 2000 that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to create a NetBIOS connection with an ISA Server by utilizing the NetBIOS (all) predefined packet filter. The attacker would be limited to services that use the NetBIOS protocol running on the affected ISA Server.

#### Mitigating Factors for NetBIOS Predefined Filter Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1216:

An ISA administrator would have to enable the NetBIOS (all) predefined packet filter to allow access to local services that use the NetBIOS protocol.

#### Workarounds for NetBIOS Predefined Filter Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1216:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for NetBIOS Predefined Filter Vulnerability - CAN-2005-1216:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could connect to services utilizing the NetBIOS protocol on the affected ISA Server.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process used by ISA Server to validate NetBIOS connections through the NetBIOS (all) predefined packet filter.

**What is NetBIOS?**

NetBIOS is a set of networking services for computer networking. NetBIOS can be implemented on top of a number of different networking protocols, such as TCP/IP.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could connect to services on the ISA Server that use the NetBIOS protocol. However, these connection attempts are subject to the typical security checks that are employed by the respective services.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

On ISA Server 2000, any anonymous user who could create a NetBIOS connection to the affected ISA Server could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**What is ISA Server 2000?**

ISA Server 2000 provides an enterprise firewall and a high-performance Web cache. The firewall helps protect the network by regulating which resources can be accessed through the firewall, and under what conditions. The Web cache helps improve network performance by storing local copies of frequently-requested Web content.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a NetBIOS connection with an ISA Server that uses the NetBIOS (all) predefined packet filter. The attacker would be limited to services by using the NetBIOS protocol running on the affected ISA Server.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

ISA Servers that have been configured to allow inbound NetBIOS traffic by using the NetBIOS (all) predefined packet filter are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
