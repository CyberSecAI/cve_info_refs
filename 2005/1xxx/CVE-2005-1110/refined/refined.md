Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Remote Stack-Based Buffer Overflow

**Root Cause:**
- The `sumus` server's HTTP handling code has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `RespondeHTTPPendiente` function.
- The vulnerability occurs within a `while` loop that copies data from the received buffer into a local buffer (`tmpCad`).
- The loop's indices are not properly validated, which allows an attacker to write past the bounds of the `tmpCad` buffer.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Insufficient bounds checking:** The `while` loop condition `(p1[j] != ' ' && p1[j])` only checks for spaces or null terminators, not the size of the destination buffer, `tmpCad`.
- **Integer Overflow:** The integer variable `kk` used as an index for the destination buffer `tmpCad`, is overwritten by a value provided in the crafted request, which allows an attacker to bypass the buffer boundary check.

**Attack Vector:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `sumus` server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable `sumus` server on the configured port.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific HTTP GET request with an overflow payload.
- No prior authentication or access is required.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer and overwriting the return address, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the `sumus` server.
- **System Compromise:** If the server runs with elevated privileges (e.g., root), the attacker could potentially gain complete control over the system.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `RespondeHTTPPendiente` function within the sumus server code.
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```c
    char tmpCad[100], *p1, *p2 ;
    ...
    if( p1 != NULL )
   {
    j = 5 ;
    kk = 0 ;
    if( j < strlen(p1) )
      while ( p1[j] != ' ' && p1[j] )
	tmpCad[kk++] = p1[j++] ;
    tmpCad[kk] = 0 ;
   }
```
- The provided exploit formats the malicious request as follows: `[FILLER]["GET"][FILLER][new "kk"][ADDR][EGG]`.
- The `[FILLER]` portion fills the buffer up to a certain point (399 bytes), `[new "kk"]` overwrites the integer `kk`, which then controls the location where the return address `[ADDR]` is written. `[EGG]` contains the attacker's shellcode.
- The attacker controls the `kk` integer by placing a specific byte in the request at an offset.
- The `ADDR` is used to overwrite the return address on the stack, redirecting execution flow to the attacker's shellcode.
- The exploit uses either a bindshell or a connect-back shellcode payload.
