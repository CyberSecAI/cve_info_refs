This document does not contain information about CVE-2005-4882. It discusses vulnerabilities in TFTPD32 that are included in Wyse Simple Imager (WSI). The vulnerabilities discussed are:

- **CVE-2002-2226**: Buffer overflow in tftpd of TFTP32 2.21 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename argument.
    - **Root cause:** Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking of filename arguments.
    - **Weakness:** Buffer overflow vulnerability.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending a long filename argument to the TFTP server.
    - **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the TFTP server.

- **CVE-2002-2237**: tftp32 TFTP server 2.21 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a GET request with a DOS device name such as com1 or aux.
    - **Root cause:** Improper handling of specific filenames that can cause a denial of service.
    - **Weakness:** Improper input validation leading to denial of service.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending a GET request with a DOS device name.
    - **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the TFTP server.

- **CVE-2002-2353**: tftpd32 2.50 and 2.50.2 allows remote attackers to read or write arbitrary files via a full pathname in GET and PUT requests.
    - **Root cause:** Allows arbitrary file read/write due to improper handling of full pathnames.
    - **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary file read and write.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending GET/PUT requests with a full path name.
    - **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the TFTP server.

- **CVE-2006-0328**: Format string vulnerability in Tftpd32 2.81 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via format string specifiers in a filename in a (1) GET or (2) SEND request.
    - **Root cause:** Uncontrolled format string usage in filename processing.
    - **Weakness:** Format string vulnerability.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending requests with format string specifiers in the filename.
    - **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the TFTP server.

- **CVE-2006-6141**: Buffer overflow in Tftpd32 3.01 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a long GET or PUT request, which is not properly handled when the request is displayed in the title of the gauge window.
     - **Root cause:** Buffer overflow when displaying long filenames in the gauge window title.
    - **Weakness:** Buffer overflow vulnerability.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending long GET/PUT requests.
    - **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the TFTP server.

- **OSVDB ID: 12898**: Tftpd32 contains a flaw that may allow a remote denial of service. The issue is triggered when the server receives a TFTP request with a long filename.
    - **Root cause:** Denial of service due to improper handling of long filenames in TFTP requests.
    - **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation leading to denial of service.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending TFTP requests with long filenames.
    - **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the TFTP server.
