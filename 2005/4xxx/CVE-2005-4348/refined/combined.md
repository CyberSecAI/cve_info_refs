How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research).

# Fetchmail

Fetchmail ist ein vollwertiges, robustes, gut dokumentiertes Dienstprogramm zum Abrufen und Weiterleiten von Remote-Mails, das für die Verwendung über On-Demand-TCP/IP-Verbindungen (wie SLIP- oder PPP-Verbindungen) vorgesehen ist. Es unterstützt jedes Remote-Mail-Protokoll, das derzeit im Internet verwendet wird: POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, alle Varianten von IMAP, ETRN und ODMR. Es kann sogar IPv6 und IPSEC unterstützen.

Fetchmail ruft E-Mails von entfernten Mail-Servern ab und leitet sie über SMTP weiter, so dass sie dann von normalen Mail-Benutzeragenten wie mutt, elm oder BSD Mail gelesen werden können. Es ermöglicht es allen Filter-, Weiterleitungs- und Aliasing-Funktionen Ihres System-MTAs, genauso zu arbeiten wie auf normalen E-Mails.

Fetchmail bietet einen besseren Schutz vor Passwortsniffing als jeder andere Unix-Remote-Mail-Client. Es unterstützt APOP, KPOP, OTP, Compuserve RPA, Microsoft NTLM und IMAP RFC1731 verschlüsselte Authentifizierungsmethoden einschließlich CRAM-MD5, um das Senden von Passwörtern en clair zu vermeiden. Es kann konfiguriert werden, um eine End-to-End-Verschlüsselung über Tunneling mit ssh, der Secure Shell, zu unterstützen.

Fetchmail kann als POP/IMAP-zu-SMTP-Gateway für eine gesamte DNS-Domäne verwendet werden, indem E-Mails aus einer einzigen Dropdown-Box auf einem ISP gesammelt und SMTP basierend auf Kopfadressen weitergeleitet werden. (Wir empfehlen dies jedoch nicht wirklich, da es wichtige Informationen über den Kuvertkopf verlieren kann. ETRN oder eine UUCP-Verbindung ist besser.)

Fetchmail kann automatisch und geräuschlos als Systemdämon beim Booten gestartet werden. Wenn man in diesem Modus mit einem kurzen Poll-Intervall läuft, ist es für jeden ziemlich schwer zu sagen, dass der eingehende Mail-Link keine Vollzeit- „Push“-Verbindung ist.

Fetchmail ist einfach zu konfigurieren. Sie können die Dotfile direkt bearbeiten oder den interaktiven GUI-Konfigurator (fetchmailconf) verwenden, der mit der fetchmail-Distribution geliefert wird. Es wird auch direkt in linuxconf Versionen 1.16r8 und höher unterstützt.

Fetchmail ist schnell und leicht. Es enthält alle seine Standardfunktionen (POP3-, IMAP- und ETRN-Unterstützung) in 196K Core auf einem Pentium unter Linux.

Fetchmail ist eine Open-Source- und kostenlose Software.

## Download

Fetchmail Download unter <https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/>

## Alternative

Eine gute Alternative ist getmail.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Security: DoS attack possible - crashes on empty message
Date: Sun, 18 Dec 2005 03:44:41 +0000
```
Package: fetchmail
Version: 6.2.5.4-1
Severity: important

Wondering why only local mail had arrived in my mailbox for several
days I found from the syslog that whenever fetchmail was started it
got as far as message 46 from my ISPs POP3 server then crashed.

I used telnet to log in to the POP3 server directly and fetched message
46 which seemed to consist only of a single blank line:

RETR 46
+OK

.
DELE 46
+OK

I have been able to work around this by deleting message 46 and it is
now fetching the other messages OK, but clearly someone could plant
such a message in someone's mailbox to disrupt their mail service - a
kind of DoS attack.

Thanks a lot Matthias,

The patch does not apply though, since xfree() is unknown in version 6.2.5.
I assume that the xfree only frees the memory when it is not NULL and sets
the variable to NULL again, so the attached patch should do the same and apply
to the version in Debian sarge/etch/sid.

Regards,

	Joey

Whoops, my apologies. Your assumptions are right, we are using this macro,
which is part of fetchmail 6.2.5.5's transact.c:

#define xfree(p) { if (p) { free(p); (p) = 0; } }

It is perhaps easier to advance to fetchmail 6.2.5.5. The number of changes
is low, and all changes either add documentation or fix important bugs.
While 6.2.5 on Debian may not need the Solaris or gettext build fix of the
day, I haven't yet heard of problems introduced that way. OTOH, I don't know
how many people have gone for 6.3.X right away.

The changelog vs. 6.2.5 is at <<http://mandree.home.pages.de/fetchmail/NEWS.txt>>

HTH,
Matthias

For sid yes.  For once released Debian versions this is not an option.

This is misattributed:
Daniel Drake (Gentoo) had publicly reported the issue on December 5 already,
<<http://lists.ccil.org/pipermail/fetchmail-friends/2005-December/009880.html>>,
two weeks before Steve Fosdick did.

At that time, a different fix had already been in the upstream fetchmail
CVS, which was in pretest phase for the 6.3.1 release that was released
one day after Steve's report.

The patch that was committed /upstream/ was a variant of
<<http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/fetchmail-devel/2005-December/000585.html>>
that left the curly braces in fetchmail. It may not qualify as the
minimum fix though.

     - Rename fetchmailconf to fetchmailconf.py. Created a /bin/sh wrapper.
     - New dummy fetchmailconf manual page.
     - fetchmailconf redirects fetchmail's input from /dev/null so it doesn't
       wait for the user to enter a password when the user doesn't even see the prompt.
     - Write RFC-compliant BSMTP envelopes.
     - Received: headers now enclose the for <...> destination address in angle
       brackets for consistency with Postfix.
     - Delete oversized messages with the new --limitflush option.
       (Closes: #[212240](bugreport.cgi?bug=212240)).
     - Add full support for --service option.
     - Make "envelope 'Delivered-To'" work with dropdelivered.
     - fetchmail should now automatically detect if OpenSSL requires -ldl
     - Missed --port/--service/--ssl cleanups in the manual.
     - Properly shut down SSL connections.
     - Add support for SubjectAltName (RFC-2595 or 2818), to avoid bogus certificate
       mismatch errors. Patch by Roland Stigge, Debian Bug#201113. (MA)
     - make fetchmail --silent --quit really silent. (Closes: #[229014](bugreport.cgi?bug=229014))
     - Exit with error if the lock file cannot be read.
     - Do not break some other process's lockfile in "-q" mode, but wait for
       the other process's exit.
     - Man page: --sslfingerprint points user to x509(1ssl) and gives an
          example how to use it. (Closes: #[213484](bugreport.cgi?bug=213484))
     - Try to obtain FQDN as our own host by default, rather than using
      "localhost". If hostname cannot be qualified, complain noisily and continue,
       unless Kerberos, ODMR or ETRN are used (these require a FQDN).
       Partial fix of Debian Bug#150137. (Closes: #[316454](bugreport.cgi?bug=316454)).
     - fetchmailconf now sets the service properly after autoprobe.
       (Closes: #[320645](bugreport.cgi?bug=320645)).
     - When eating IMAP message trailer, don't see any line containing "OK"
       as the end of the trailer, but wait for the proper tagged OK line. To work
       around the qmail + Courier-IMAP problem in Debian. (Closes: #[338007](bugreport.cgi?bug=338007)).
     - Fixes: when trying to send a bounce message, don't bail out if we cannot
       qualify our own hostname, so we aren't losing the bounce. Instead, pass the
       buck on to the SMTP server and use our own unqualified hostname.
       (Closes: #[317761](bugreport.cgi?bug=317761))
     - Updated translations: Albanian [sq] (Besnik Bleta), Catalan [ca] (Ernest
       Adrogué Calveras), Czech [cs] (Miloslav Trmac), German [de] (MA),
       Spanish (Castilian) [es] (Javier Kohen), French [fr] (MA),
       Polish [pl] (Jakub Bogusz), Russian [ru] (Pavel Maryanov).
     - In oversized warning messages, print the account name, too.
       (Closes: #[213299](bugreport.cgi?bug=213299)).
   * Remove man1 from mandir on install time. (change on the packaging).
   * Deleted es.po patch. Included upstream. Updated 00list.
   * Added myself to uploaders.
   * Added patch to fix warning on fetchmail man page. Should submit upstream.

Package        : fetchmail
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-4348

Daniel Drake discovered a problem in fetchmail, an SSL enabled POP3,
APOP, IMAP mail gatherer/forwarder, that can cause a crash when the
program is running in multidrop mode and receives messages without
headers.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2.5-12sarge4.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your fetchmail package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
