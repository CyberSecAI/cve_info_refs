How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H3 (2.0.6).

This is a security release that fixes cross site scripting
vulnerabilities in several of the calendar name and event data
fields. None of the vulnerabilities can be exploited by
unauthenticated users; however, we strongly recommend that all users
of Kronolith 2.0.5 upgrade to 2.0.6 as soon as possible.

Many thanks to Johannes Greil of SEC Consult
(<http://www.sec-consult.com/>) for reporting these problems and working
with us to test the fixes.

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application.  It provides web-based calendar=
s
backed by a SQL database, the MCAL library, or a Kolab server.  Supported
features include shared calendars, remote calendars, meeting management,
alarms, recurring events, and a sophisticated day/week view which handles
arbitrary numbers of overlapping events.

Major changes compared to the Kronolith version H3 (2.0.5) are:
    * Close several XSS problems with calendar and event fields.

The full list of changes (from version H3 (2.0.5)) can be viewed here:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 970-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
February 14th, 2006                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : kronolith
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-4189
Debian Bugs    : 342943 349261

Johannes Greil of SEC Consult discovered several cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities in kronolith, the Horde calendar application.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain kronolith packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.4-2sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.6-1 of kronolith2.

We recommend that you upgrade your kronolith and kronolith2 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
