      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-4536",
      "description": "Mail::Audit module in libmail-audit-perl 2.1-5, when logging is enabled without a default log file specified, uses predictable log filenames, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the [PID]-audit.log temporary file.",
      "root_cause": "The Mail::Audit module, when logging is enabled, creates a log file in /tmp with a predictable name based on the user ID and process ID. It also follows symlinks when writing to the log file.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Insecure temporary file creation",
        "Symlink following"
      ],
      "impact": "Local users can overwrite arbitrary files by creating a symlink to the target file, then triggering the logging functionality.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local user privileges on the system.",
       "additional_details": "The module logs by default to `/tmp/`.getpwuid($>).`-audit.log` if logging is enabled and no logfile is explicitly specified. The module will follow symlinks and append to the corresponding file. A patch was created that checks if `$ENV{HOME}` is set and writable, and uses `$ENV{HOME}/.mail_audit.log` for the log file. If `$ENV{HOME}` is not set or writable, it uses `tempfile()` to create a temporary file, but due to a bug, this file was also written to the current working directory and would fail if it was not writable. This was fixed in a later version.",
