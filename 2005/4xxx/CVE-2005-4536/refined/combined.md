How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Mail::Audit module in libmail-audit-perl 2.1-5, when logging is enabled without a default log file specified, uses predictable log filenames, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the [PID]-audit.log temporary file. |

Subject: libmail-audit-perl: insecure /tmp handling
Date: Mon, 19 Dec 2005 16:45:28 +0200
```
Package: libmail-audit-perl
Version: 2.1-5
Severity: serious
Justification: Etch RC policy

The Mail::Audit module logs by default to

my $logfile = "/tmp/".getpwuid($>)."-audit.log";

if logging is turned on (the loglevel parameter to new()) and
no logfile is explicitly specified.

The module will follow any symlinks and append to the corresponding file:

if ($logging) { open LOG, ">>$logfile" or open LOG, ">>/dev/null";

This is RC according to the Etch release policy [1]:

  (h) Temporary files

	Any programs and scripts that create files in /tmp or other
	world writable directories must use a mechanism which fails if
	the file already exists.

An obvious workaround would be to log into eg. "$HOME/mail-audit.log".

(I'm not sure if this should be tagged "security" and fixed for sarge too,
 so I'm leaving that for others to judge.)

Attached is the patch for the NMU that I am preparing; I will upload
it to a delay queue sometime tomorrow (assuming it checks out when
I've had more sleep.)

Hi,

and thanks for the patch.

FWIW, we discussed this package a bit on the Debian Perl list (see the
thread at <<http://lists.debian.org/debian-perl/2005/12/msg00033.html>>),
and the consensus was that is should be removed. It's officially
unsupported upstream, and the author recommends Email::Filter
(currently in NEW) as a replacement. I'm going to file a removal
request once libemail-filter-perl gets in.

As for the /tmp vulnerabilities, the one in Mail::Audit::MimeEntity
doesn't look quite as serious to me. I looked into it a bit, and
although it does fall back to /tmp and follows symlinks, MIME::Parser
uses a not quite trivially guessable directory underneath (current time
+ process ID, IIRC). Naturally, this doesn't mean it shouldn't be
fixed.

If you still want to do the NMU, that's fine of course. I guess the
sarge version should be patched anyway.

Cheers,

The important issue is that we've made a stable release with the
package, and so the (albiet not so serious) security bug needs to be
fixed, even if we end up removing it from unstable and testing. [Which
I would recommend, given the rather lackluster quality of the code in
that module.]

Hi,

The bug is indeed important, even if it is not easily exploitable, and
the fix is trivial. I am pushing it to the security team so they can
apply it to the version in Sarge as well.

Please use [CVE-2005-4536](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4536) for this problem.

Are you in contact with upstream?

Upstream has abandoned this package and suggest replacing it - But
it's present in Sarge (the complete information is in the bug
report).

Ok.  I'll prepare a DSA with updates for sarge and woody.

What should really happen is the package should be removed from
testing and unstable; I'll make an upload with it sometime today, then
request removal once it has propogated to unstable/testing.

Florian,

Don't bother with the NMU - I just filed bug #349551 requesting the
removal of this package, as libemail-filter-perl has already got in.

Greetings,

Hi security team,

unfortunately there's an error in the sarge package:

% perl -c /usr/share/perl5/Mail/Audit/MimeEntity.pm
syntax error at /usr/share/perl5/Mail/Audit/MimeEntity.pm line 8, near "use MIME::Parser"
/usr/share/perl5/Mail/Audit/MimeEntity.pm had compilation errors.

ii  libmail-audit-perl        2.1-5sarge1               Perl library for creating easy mail filters

Don's patch in #344029 had a typo (missing semicolon). See #349838 for the fix.

Apologies; we should have Cc'd the patch to security@ .

Subject: DSA-960 - New bug possibly introduced
Date: Wed, 1 Feb 2006 01:11:09 -0800 (PST)
```
Hello,

The recent security update for libmail-audit-perl (DSA-960) appears to
have introduced a new bug.  I have been using debian for several years now
and this is the first time that a security update turned out to be
problematic for me.  Still an excellent track record in my book. :)

E-mail is often a touchy subject for a lot of people, so I thought I would
post the problem I encountered, which might be causing delivery problems
for other Debian/Mail::Audit users.

I am using Woody, Exim 3 and a perl script that make use of Mail::Audit. This
script executes as the mail user; the same user id under which Exim is running.

The problematic portion of the patch seems to be here:

-my $logfile = "/tmp/".getpwuid($>)."-audit.log";
+my $logfile;
+if (exists $ENV{HOME} and defined $ENV{HOME} and -d $ENV{HOME}) {
+     $logfile = "$ENV{HOME}/.mail_audit.log"
+}
+else {
+     (undef,$logfile) = tempfile("mail_audit.log-XXXXX",TMPDIR=>1);
+}

For reasons I haven't investigated, $ENV{HOME} is not being set when a
child process (my script) is spawned.  This is causing the else clause to
be triggered, in the above logic.  I further looked at the code for
File::Temp, and don't see any reference to a 'TMPDIR' option related to
the tempfile function.  I also have determined that the cwd of my
executing script does not default to the mail user's home directory, but
to an unwritable directory (/) under which $logfile cannot be written to.

So instead of relying on the HOME environment variable being set, it could
possibly make more sense to use to do a getpwuid call for the UID present in $<.

Below is a simple patch, but I'm sure there is more than one way to do it. I
didn't look in to how trustworthy $< is, but I think any serious risk is
mitigated with subsequent getpwuid call.

Thanks,

Brian Hodges

Hi security team,

I'm very sorry that you have to hear from me again :(

There's a regression in the patch for DSA-960-1, for both woody and sarge.
When $HOME is not set, Mail::Audit is now creating logfiles in cwd and
dying if it's not writable.  This happens even if logging is turned off,
which makes the problem much more serious.

I have not yet had a proper look at the proposed patches in #350954 and
the last message of #344029, but I wanted to make you aware of this.

Again, my apologies for the bad handling of this.

Doo, I have to agree that it is confusing to have tempdir() use different
parameters as tempfile(), but only partially.

Comments to the attached patch, which are least intrusive to the
update we're already distributing?

It's certainly the minimum required change. However, after this patch
Mail::Audit is still leaving behind a file in /tmp every time it's used
without $HOME, whether logging is enabled or not. And the documentation
remains out of sync. (Naturally, it's your call to decide whether these
should be fixed or not, but I just wanted to point them out.)

FWIW, the patch in #350954 by Robert L Mathews addresses both of these issues.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
