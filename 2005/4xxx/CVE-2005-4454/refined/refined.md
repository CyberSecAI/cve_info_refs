  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in LiveJournal's cleanhtml.pl script. This script, responsible for parsing user-supplied HTML, incorrectly handles style attributes when the cleancss option is enabled. It strips slashes after checking for 'javascript', allowing 'java\\script' to become 'javascript'.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input sanitization, specifically a flawed logic in stripping slashes within CSS style attributes, which bypasses the intended 'javascript' filter.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a LiveJournal page. When a user views this page, the injected script executes in the user's browser, enabling the attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, phishing, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is user-supplied HTML content, specifically through the style attribute of HTML tags. By inserting a crafted style attribute containing 'java\\script' an attacker can bypass the filter and inject arbitrary JavaScript.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to submit user-supplied HTML content that will be processed by the vulnerable cleanhtml.pl script. This would typically involve creating a LiveJournal post or comment."
