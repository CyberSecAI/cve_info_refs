{
  "CVE-2005-4874": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The XMLHttpRequest object in Mozilla browsers allowed newline characters in the value field of setRequestHeader, enabling attackers to inject arbitrary data into HTTP headers.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Ability to inject arbitrary header data",
        "Lack of restriction on modifiable headers"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers, leading to request splitting, credential theft (including Basic authentication passwords and cookies), and external script injection. This could also allow redirection of requests to other domains, especially in shared hosting environments.",
      "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious web page that uses XMLHttpRequest to send crafted requests containing newline characters.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to host a malicious web page and have a victim visit it in a vulnerable browser. The attack is more effective in shared-hosting environments or when a user is behind a proxy server."
    },
    {
       "Root cause": "The XMLHttpRequest object allowed the use of the TRACE method, which could reveal proxy passwords.",
       "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of restriction on HTTP methods",
        "Inadequate security checks on XMLHttpRequest API"
        ],
       "Impact": "A malicious webpage could use the TRACE method via XMLHttpRequest to steal proxy passwords, especially if the proxy does not implement protections against TRACE requests.",
       "Attack vectors": "Malicious JavaScript code in a webpage using XMLHttpRequest with the TRACE method.",
       "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to host a malicious web page and convince a victim to visit it using a vulnerable browser behind a proxy."
