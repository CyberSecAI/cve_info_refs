{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-4318",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the `_SERVER[REMOTE_ADDR]` variable before using it in a SQL query when register_globals is off in LIMBO CMS <= v1.0.4.2.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "SQL injection",
	 "Arbitrary PHP Code Execution",
	 "Local File Inclusion",
	"Path Disclosure",
	"Cross-site scripting"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to remote code execution, sensitive data disclosure, and other malicious activities. Furthermore, arbitrary php files can be included from local resources leading to arbitrary code execution. Path disclosure can leak information on the server file system. It is possible to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks to steal user cookies.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests",
		"By manipulating _SERVER array and REMOTE_ADDR value"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker also needs to be able to set the value of the `_SERVER` array, which is possible when register_globals is off."
