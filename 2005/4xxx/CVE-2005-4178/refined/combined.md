Hi all.

I've put up a new release 0.47 of Dropbear, which has
various fixes and new features - see the change summary
below.
<http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html> is the
url as usual or directly at
<http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear-0.47.tar.bz2>

This release also fixes a potential security issue, which
may allow authenticated users to run arbitrary code as the
server user. I'm unsure exactly how likely it is to be
exploitable, but anyone who's running a multi-user server is
advised to upgrade. For older releases, the patch is:
(against chanesssion.c for 0.43 and earlier).

--- svr-chansession.c
+++ svr-chansession.c

 	/* need to increase size */

 		svr_ses.childpids = (struct ChildPid*)m_realloc(svr_ses.childpids,

+				sizeof(struct ChildPid) * (svr_ses.childpidsize+1));
 		svr_ses.childpidsize++;

Matt

0.47 - Thurs Dec 8 2005

- SECURITY: fix for buffer allocation error in server code, could potentially
  allow authenticated users to gain elevated privileges. All multi-user systems
  running the server should upgrade (or apply the patch available on the
  Dropbear webpage).

- Fix channel handling code so that redirecting to /dev/null doesn't use
  100% CPU.

- Turn on zlib compression for dbclient.

- Set "low delay" TOS bit, can significantly improve interactivity
  over some links.

- Added client keyboard-interactive mode support, allows operation with
  newer OpenSSH servers in default config.

- Log when pubkey auth fails because of bad ~/.ssh/authorized_keys permissions

- Improve logging of assertions

- Added aes-256 cipher and sha1-96 hmac.

- Fix twofish so that it actually works.

- Improve PAM prompt comparison.

- Added -g (dbclient) and -a (dropbear server) options to allow
  connections to listening forwarded ports from remote machines.

- Various other minor fixes

- Compile fixes for glibc 2.1 (ss_family vs __ss_family) and NetBSD
  (netinet/in_systm.h needs to be included).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 923-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
December 19th, 2005                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : dropbear
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-4178

A buffer overflow has been discovered in dropbear, a lightweight SSH2
server and client, that may allow authenticated users to execute
arbitrary code as the server user (usually root).

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain dropbear packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.45-2sarge0.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.47-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dropbear package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

[Download](./)

Latest is 2024.86

22 October 2024

[dropbear‑2024.86.tar.bz2](releases/dropbear-2024.86.tar.bz2 "Latest Release")

[Changelog](CHANGES)

[Git Source](https://github.com/mkj/dropbear)

[Mailing List](https://lists.ucc.asn.au/mailman/listinfo/dropbear)

[Mirror](https://mirror.dropbear.nl/mirror/)

## Dropbear SSH

Dropbear is a relatively small [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) server and client. It runs on a
variety of unix platforms. Dropbear is open
source software, distributed under a [MIT-style
license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkj/dropbear/master/LICENSE). Dropbear is particularly useful for "embedded"-type Linux (or other Unix) systems, such as wireless routers.

If you want to be notified of new releases, or for general discussion of
Dropbear, you can subscribe to the relatively low volume [mailing
list](https://lists.ucc.asn.au/mailman/listinfo/dropbear).

### Features

* A small memory footprint suitable for memory-constrained environments – Dropbear can compile to a [110kB statically
  linked binary](http://lists.ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au/pipermail/dropbear/2004q3/000022.html) with uClibc on x86 (only minimal options selected)
* Dropbear server implements X11 forwarding, and authentication-agent forwarding for [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.org)
  clients
* Can run from inetd or standalone
* Compatible with OpenSSH ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys public key authentication
* The server, client, keygen, and key converter can be compiled into a single binary (like [busybox](http://www.busybox.net))
* Features can easily be disabled when compiling to save space
* Multi-hop mode uses SSH TCP forwarding to tunnel through multiple SSH
  hosts in a single command. dbclient user1@hop1,user2@hop2,destination

### Platforms

* Linux – standard distributions, [uClibc](http://www.uclibc.org), [dietlibc](http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/), [musl libc](http://musl.libc.org/), uClinux from inetd
* Mac OS X (compile with PAM support)
* FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD
* Solaris – tested v8 x86 and v9 Sparc
* IRIX 6.5 (with /dev/urandom, or prngd should work)
* Tru64 5.1 (using prngd for entropy)
* AIX 4.3.3 (with gcc and Linux Affinity Toolkit), AIX 5.2 (with /dev/urandom).
* HPUX 11.00 (+prngd), TCP forwarding doesn't work
* Cygwin – tested 1.5.19 on Windows XP

It shouldn't be hard to get it to work on other POSIX platforms, it is mostly a
case of setting up the configure and Makefile settings.

### Acknowledgements

The cryptographic code utilises Tom St Denis's
[LibTomCrypt](http://www.libtom.net/LibTomCrypt/), and uses his
[LibTomMath](http://www.libtom.net/LibTomMath/) library for the
bignum parts.
PTY handling code is taken from
[OpenSSH](http://openssh.org/) (from Tatu Ylönen's original
ssh), login recording (utmp/wtmp) code is from OpenSSH by Andre Lucas,
and some implementation details were gleaned from
[PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).
Numerous people have contributed patches and bug reports, see <CHANGES>. Particular thanks go to Mihnea Stoenescu for his
work on the client portion.

Dropbear's website is hosted by
[The University Computer Club](https://www.ucc.asn.au/) in
Perth, Australia

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Dropbear: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200512-13**

A buffer overflow in Dropbear could allow authenticated users to execute
arbitrary code as the root user.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/dropbear** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.47** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.47** |

### Background

Dropbear is an SSH server and client with a small memory
footprint.

### Description

Under certain conditions Dropbear could fail to allocate a
sufficient amount of memory, possibly resulting in a buffer overflow.

### Impact

By sending specially crafted data to the server, authenticated
users could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with
the permissions of the SSH server user, which is the root user by
default.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Dropbear users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/dropbear-0.47"
```
