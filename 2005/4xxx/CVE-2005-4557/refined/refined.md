  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient input validation and improper initialization of variables in IceWarp Web Mail.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of 'lang' parameter leading to arbitrary local file inclusion.",
        "Improper initialization of 'language' and 'lang_settings' variables allowing overwriting and inclusion of arbitrary PHP scripts.",
          "Improper initialization of 'default_layout' and 'layout_settings' variables when encountering unrecognized HTTP_USER_AGENT strings leading to local file disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to:\n  - Arbitrary PHP code execution on the vulnerable server with SYSTEM privileges.\n  - Disclosure of sensitive information by accessing arbitrary files on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP requests to specific vulnerable scripts with manipulated parameters.",
