      "source": "www.ush.it_90714d35_20250125_140201.html",
      "details": "Php Web Statistik is vulnerable to multiple issues:\n\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `lastnumber` GET parameter is not validated, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript. Single quotes are escaped, but other injection methods are possible.\n    *   **Attack vector**: GET request with malicious value in the `lastnumber` parameter.\n    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation for the `lastnumber` GET parameter.\n    *   **Impact**: Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.\n*   **Configuration Exposure:** The configuration file (`stat.cfg`) is accessible via a direct GET request.\n    *   **Attack vector**: Direct access via a GET request to `/stat/stat.cfg`\n    *   **Weakness:**  Configuration file exposed in the webroot.\n    *   **Impact**: Disclosure of the application's configuration, including the database directory.\n*   **Log Database Exposure**: The log database file can be accessed using the directory path exposed in the config file, even when directory listing is disabled.\n    *  **Attack vector**: Direct access via a GET request to location identified in config file.\n    *   **Weakness:**  Database location revealed through exposed configuration, potentially allowing unauthorized access.\n    *   **Impact**: Disclosure of the stats database which may contain sensitive information.\n*   **Application-Level Denial of Service (DoS):** Submitting a large integer for `lastnumber` can cause a script timeout due to excessive resource consumption.\n    *   **Attack vector**: GET request with a large integer value for the `lastnumber` parameter.\n    *   **Weakness:** Unvalidated integer input leads to resource exhaustion.\n    *  **Impact**: Denial of service by exhausting server resources.\n*   **XSS via Referer Field:** The referer field is stored in the flat database, which allows for XSS attacks when the data is displayed on the backend.\n    *   **Attack vector**:  Malicious javascript in the referrer header sent via a request to the pixel.php file.\n    *   **Weakness:**  Unvalidated referrer data is stored in the database and displayed on the backend.\n    *   **Impact**:  XSS when viewing logged data, can be used to execute arbitrary javascript by attacker.\n*  **Disk and Quota Misuse**: The database doesn't rotate, allowing attackers to fill disk space with large referrer values.\n    *   **Attack vector**: Repeated requests with large referrer values.\n    *  **Weakness**: Lack of database rotation allows an attacker to exhaust disk quota\n    *   **Impact**:  Disk quota exhaustion and denial of service."
