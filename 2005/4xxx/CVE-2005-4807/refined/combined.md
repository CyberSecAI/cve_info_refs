(2a.

Do you think it's worth adding the patch to our package Spanky?  ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-07-21 23:30:05 UTC  ``` Rerating as B2.  ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2005-07-22 10:34:23 UTC  ``` not really ... if i do this one, then i should go through all the other BFD fixes that have been posted to the binutils mailing list in the last few months since the 1.16.1 release ... ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-07-30 06:39:58 UTC  ``` Even if we did some GLSAs in the past that required heavy social engineering (read: dumb user) to work, I don't think we should continue on that trend. I propose to downgrade this to simple bug status.  Security: please give your opinion. ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-07-31 12:59:42 UTC  ``` I agree. Reassigning to toolchain, keeping security on cc.  ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2005-09-26 17:11:26 UTC  ``` should be all set now ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-336-1: binutils vulnerability

17 August 2006

binutils vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

A buffer overflow was discovered in gas (the GNU assembler). By

tricking an user or automated system (like a compile farm) into

assembling a specially crafted source file with gcc or gas, this could

be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* binutils
  -
  2.16.1-2ubuntu6.2
* binutils-static
  -
  2.16.1-2ubuntu6.2

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* binutils
  -
  2.15-5ubuntu2.4

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
