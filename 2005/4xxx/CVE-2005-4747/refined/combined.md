Hello,

I signed up to be able to mail support a question regarding your product,
but it says that since I don't have a contract I can't do that. Hopefully
you will be able to forward this on to the appropriate people.

Recently, a few security vulnerabilities were reported in one of your
products:

<http://pridels.blogspot.com/2006/03/helm-web-hosting-control-panel-xss.html>

The above reports says there are some cross-site scripting (XSS) issues in
default.asp. This report says that 3.2.10 is vulnerable but I noticed the
product history lists the following:

<http://www.webhostautomation.com/webhost-301>

3.2.6
Fixed XSS entry in default page

Can you confirm these are seperate issues? Does this changelog entry note
a previous (but different) cross-site scripting issue?

Thanks,

Brian

```

[..]

Yes, they were separate issues. 3.2.10 isn't even released yet. It is in
beta. The XSS problem mentioned in the below article has already been
fixed, and when 3.2.10 stable is released, the fixes will be included.

Kind regards,

Rob Kershaw
