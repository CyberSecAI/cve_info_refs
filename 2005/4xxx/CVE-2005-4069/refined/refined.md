  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "www.kb.cert.org_d9a5d348_20250124_155804.html",
      "root_cause": "The MediaMax software is installed with overly permissive file permissions, specifically granting 'Full Control' to 'Everyone' for the installation directory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure File Permissions"
      ],
      "impact": "A user with filesystem access can replace MediaMax software with arbitrary code. When a MediaMax CD is launched, this malicious code will execute with the privileges of the user, potentially leading to privilege escalation if an administrator launches the CD.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "File system manipulation",
         "CD Autorun"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs filesystem access and ability to replace files in the MediaMax installation directory. No specific user privileges are needed before the attack. However, the impact is higher if the user launching the CD has administrative privileges."
