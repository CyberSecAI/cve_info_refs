Affected Version:
WinRAR 3.51 English Version
Other versions may also be affected.
Tested Entironment:
Windows XP Korea Version(full patched without SP.)
WinRAR 3.51 English Version
A file with Chinese Filename
Description:
When we use "Add to archive" command in right click menu to create a compressed file ,if there are some non-default-codepage and non-ansi characters in the name of the file(s) to be compressed ,a buffer overflow fault will occured.
details:
[1]:%eax should be sum of filename-base and strlen ,but %eax will be incorrect in the entironment mention above .maybe it's because WinRAR can't get the right strlen [reason is not confirmed]
[2]:the WideCharToMultiByte API will overwrite the pointer referenced by [1]
0048CFAE mov edx,dword ptr ds:[4a330c]
0048CFB4 mov eax, edx
0048D028 mov ecx, [eax] ; [1]

0040ACC4 mov ecx, 10000000h ; cbMultiByte
0040ACC9 mov edx, [ebp+lpMultiByteStr] ; lpMultiByteStr
0040ACCF mov eax, esi ; lpWideCharStr
0040ACD1 call sub\_40F874
0040F874 push ebx
0040F875 push esi

0040F878 mov bl,1
0040F87A push 0 ; /pDefaultCharUsed = NULL
0040F87C push 0 ; |pDefaultChar = NULL
0040F87E push esi ; |MultiByteCount = 10000000h

0040F885 push 0 ; |CodePage = CP\_ACP
0040F887 call WideCharToMultiByte ; \WideCharToMultiByte
etc
for this vulnerability is difficult to exploit, I post it here directly without notifying the vendor.
