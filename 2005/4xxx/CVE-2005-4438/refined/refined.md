{
  "CVE-2005-4438": {
    "Description": "The Symantec RAR decompression library Dec2RAR.dll contains multiple heap buffer overflows. A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by causing a Symantec product to scan a specially crafted RAR archive.",
    "Root cause": "Multiple heap buffer overflows in the Symantec RAR decompression library (Dec2RAR.dll).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. Since many scanning processes run with Local System privileges, the attacker could take complete control of a vulnerable system.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Hosting the malicious RAR archive on a website",
      "Sending the malicious RAR archive as an email attachment",
      "Providing the malicious RAR archive on a file system or network share"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious RAR archive to trigger the heap overflow."
  }
