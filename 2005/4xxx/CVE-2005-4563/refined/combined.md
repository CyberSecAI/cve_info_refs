[[Attachment #2 (multipart/alternative)]](?l=full-disclosure&m=113510305413525&q=p2)

Author: Attila Gerendi (Darkz)
Date: December 20, 2005
Package: Enterprise Connector (
<http://www.enterpriseheart.com/site/modules/mydownloads/>)
Versions Affected: 1.02 (Other versions may also be affected.)
Severity: SQL Injection, Login Bypass

Description:

Some of this SQL injection vulnerabilities are already reported at:
    <http://secunia.com/advisories/17743/>

A new SQL vulnerability not listed in the previous report:

Input passed to the "loginid" parameter in "main.php" isn't properly
sanitised before being used in
a SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
arbitrary SQL code and
bypass login sequence.

Login Bypass Example:
    username 'or isnull(1/0) /*
    password (no password required)

or just simply call main.php with POST_PARAMETER loginid='or isnull(1/0) /*

Vulnerable code piece:

$sql = "SELECT userid, companyid, departmentid, status, languagefile FROM
connector_user WHERE ";
    $sql .= "userid = '" . $_POST['loginid'] . "' ";
    $sql .= " AND password = '" . $_POST['password'] . "'";
    $result = sql_execute($sql);

There may be more SQL injection vulnerabilities there.

The Author was contacted via home page "contact us" module at December 8
2005, no response given.

Solution:
Enterprise Connector  development seen to be suspended by now. No new
release from 2004/4/27.
You may edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
