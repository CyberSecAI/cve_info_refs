Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2005-4808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow was discovered in `gas` (the GNU assembler).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability in the GNU assembler (`gas`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By tricking a user or automated system into assembling a specially crafted source file with `gcc` or `gas`, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by assembling a specially crafted source file. This could involve:
    - Social engineering to trick a user into compiling a malicious file.
    - Compromising automated systems (like a compile farm) to assemble malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide or trick a user into assembling a specially crafted source file using `gcc` or `gas`.
