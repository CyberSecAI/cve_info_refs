# Geeklog 1.3.11sr3

[![Security](https://www.geeklog.net/images/topics/security.png "Security")](https://www.geeklog.net/index.php/topic/Security)

Geeklog 1.3.11sr3 addresses two security issues as well as a few bugs:

* It was possible to submit comments even if you didn't have read permissions for the story or the topic, provided you knew the story's ID (reported by LWC).
* When tampering with the dates in a search, Geeklog produced a warning message that would disclose the path in which Geeklog was installed on the server (reported by r0t3d3Vil). It was **not** possible to use this for SQL injections.

The most notable bugfix in this release addresses the problems editing static pages when 'url\_rewrite' was enabled (that bug was only introduced in 1.3.11sr2).

As usual, we provide both a [complete 1.3.11sr3 tarball](http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/singlefile.php?lid=631) as well as an [upgrade](http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/singlefile.php?lid=630) over 1.3.11sr2 (please see the included installation instructions).

Note: Both issues also exist in [Geeklog 1.4.0b1](http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/geeklog-1.4.0b1) but have since been fixed in CVS. We will be releasing 1.4.0rc1 in a couple of days. In the meantime, you can get the [nightly tarball](http://www.geeklog.net/staticpages/index.php/CVS) if you want to update your 1.4.0b1 install now.

Does the comment bug apply to other themes? (It looks like only a fix for the Professional theme was included in the upgrade.)

Does the comment bug apply if comments have been disabled?

The supplied change for commentbar.thtml has to be applied to all themes. This is for the comment bug mentioned in the changelog, **not** for the comment security issue.

### Geeklog 1.3.11sr3

Authored by: Anonymous (Anonymous User) on Monday, December 19 2005 @ 02:26 am EST

I replaced all included files to update to sr3 but when I get to replace the lib-common.php file and reload my site I get this error:
"An SQL error has occured. Please see error.log for details."

My error log says:
"Mon Dec 19 14:00:52 2005 - 1146: Table 'xxx\_gl\_b.WP\_BB\_LOG' doesn't exist. SQL in question: SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM WP\_BB\_LOG "

I can't even imagine for which plugin these table are meant to be....

Bad Behavior. You forgot that extra line in lib-common.php which that plugin needs.

### Inmemoriam Install Problem

Authored by: [jackbox](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=12043) on Saturday, December 24 2005 @ 09:27 pm EST

When I installed Inmemoriam photo galleries it created double menu items for the forums and for itself. I do not know what file I need to edit to remove the double menu items. Anyone who knows how to fix this please reply asap. Thank you.

Recently, I have moved stories that tracked a lot of spammers - and were not blocked from anonymous access - into topics that are.

After putting those stories in safe places and also since [Spam-X was shipped with Geeklog](http:///forum/viewtopic.php?forum=2&showtopic=60440) (yea, I've updated to the last mt-blocklist), I've decided it was time to once again enable anonymous comments.

One day later I've got dozens - dozens - of spam comments...to THOSE stories (in the no anonymous access' topics)!

How come? Those topics are blocked from anonymous access!

And what can I do now?!

The easiest thing is to delete comments by the commentator's IP address via Spam-x's "Edit IP Blacklist", but mass delete ignores it! Perhaps it only works for **future** comments?

Then, importing Geeklog's censor list to "Edit Personal Blacklist" is no good because Geeklog has automatically censored the comments!!!

I actually tried adding the word "\*\*censored\*\*", but other than the fact that legit comments may have been censored, most comments used words that were not censored (and some of them don't even have links).

If I'm forced not to use an IP address, which would have been the easiest way, what can I do? There are too many unique words in those comments!

Please help!

P.S.
For .htaccess purposes (for the future), the spammer used no referrer.

I've just read it's fixed in 1.3.11sr3! It's great to realize my posts are noticed even if I get no replies.

Anyway, I just thought it was a flaw in the topics' protection. It's scary to think (according to what you wrote) it happened when the stories were protected directly.

Thanks for the fix!

Yeah, sorry, should at least have sent you an email ...

Btw, our preferred procedure for reporting supposed security issues is outlined [here](http://www.geeklog.net/staticpages/index.php?page=GeeklogSecurity).
