Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and Denial of Service (DoS)

**Products Affected:**
*   Groupmax Collaboration Portal
*   Groupmax Collaboration Web Client - Forum/File Sharing
*   Cosminexus Collaboration Portal
*   Cosminexus Collaboration Portal - Forum/File Sharing
Specifically, the vulnerabilities are in the "Collaboration - Schedule" and "Collaboration - Calendar" components of these products.

**Root Cause:**
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The products do not properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into web pages, which are then executed in a user's browser.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The products are vulnerable to DoS attacks due to the ability to send repeated invalid requests to "Collaboration - Schedule", leading to resource exhaustion or service disruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XSS:** Improper input validation and sanitization.
*  **DoS:** Insufficient protection against repeated invalid requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:**
    *   Malicious users can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser when accessing the affected web pages. This could lead to unauthorized actions on the user's behalf, data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the web page.
*   **DoS:**
    *   Malicious users can cause the system to become unresponsive or unavailable by sending repeated invalid requests, disrupting the normal operation of the products and affecting legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** The attacker injects malicious scripts through vulnerable input fields or parameters within the "Collaboration - Schedule" and "Collaboration - Calendar" components, which are then reflected back to users' browsers.
*   **DoS:** The attacker sends repeated invalid requests to the "Collaboration - Schedule" component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web application. This could be achieved by either having an account within the system or by exploiting publicly accessible interfaces of the application.
*   For XSS, the attacker requires a method to inject malicious code into fields that are reflected to users' browsers.
* For DoS, the attacker needs to be able to send a high volume of crafted requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   Hitachi released fixes for these vulnerabilities on October 31, 2005, with the advisory being published on November 18, 2005.
*  The advisory provides a list of affected product versions and the fixed versions.
