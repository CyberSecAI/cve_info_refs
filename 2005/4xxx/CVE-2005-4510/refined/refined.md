  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing file paths, allowing directory traversal.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Directory Traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a URL with directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../), an attacker can access files outside of the web root directory.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the file system to target specific files."
