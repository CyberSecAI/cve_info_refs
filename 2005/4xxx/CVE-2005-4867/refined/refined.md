Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-4867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `SATENCRYPT` function within the `SATADMIN` schema of IBM DB2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `SATENCRYPT` function creates a 40-byte buffer on the stack. User-supplied data is copied into this buffer without proper bounds checking. By providing an input longer than 40 bytes, an attacker can overwrite the buffer, including the saved return address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevated Privileges:** Overwriting the saved return address allows an attacker to redirect program execution to arbitrary code, potentially gaining elevated privileges on the system.
*   The advisory mentions "medium risk from remote".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection**: The vulnerability is exploited by passing a string longer than 40 bytes as a parameter to the vulnerable SQL function, `SATENCRYPT`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to DB2:** The attacker needs access to the DB2 database server to execute the vulnerable `SATENCRYPT` function.
*   **Function Execution Rights:** Although the advisory notes that by default, public cannot execute this function, an attacker with the necessary rights could exploit the vulnerability.
*  The advisory mentions a "medium risk from remote".

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects DB2 version 8.1 and potentially 7.x.
*   IBM has released patches to address this vulnerability via fixpacks for the affected versions.
*   NGSSQuirreL for DB2 can be used to assess if a DB2 server is vulnerable.
