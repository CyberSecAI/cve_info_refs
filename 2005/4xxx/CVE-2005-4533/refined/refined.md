{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient command-line parameter validation in scponly when handling scp or rsync commands.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "The scponlyc command allows chrooting into arbitrary directories.",
    "Insufficient validation of command-line parameters in scponly for scp and rsync commands."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local attacker can gain root privileges by chrooting into arbitrary directories containing hardlinks to setuid programs. A remote scponly user can escape shell restrictions and execute arbitrary programs.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Local exploitation via the scponlyc command.",
     "Remote exploitation by sending malicious parameters to scp or rsync commands."
    ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker needs access to the system, remote attacker requires a restricted scponly shell."
