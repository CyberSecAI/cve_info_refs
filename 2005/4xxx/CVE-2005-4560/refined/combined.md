How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, public vulnerability. The vulnerability is documented in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin.

**Note** This vulnerability is currently being exploited and was previously discussed by Microsoft in Microsoft Security Advisory 912840.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows ME | Windows 2000 | Windows XP Service Pack 1 | Windows XP Service Pack 2 | Windows Server 2003 | Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - [CVE-2005-4560](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4560) | Remote Code Execution\ | Not Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The severity ratings for non-x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating systems versions as follows:

* The Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows XP Service Pack 2 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. The change introduced to address this vulnerability removes the support for the SETABORTPROC record type from the META\_ESCAPE record in a WMF image. This update does not remove support for ABORTPROC functions registered by application SetAbortProc() API calls.

**How does the extended support for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition affect the release of security updates for these operating systems?**

For these versions of Windows, Microsoft will only release security updates for critical security issues. Non-critical security issues are not offered during this support period. For more information about the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policies for these operating systems, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33327).

For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities that are addressed in this security bulletin?**

No. Although Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition do contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical because an exploitable attack vector has not been identified that would yield a Critical severity rating for these versions. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 ended on June 30, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a ended on December 31, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 ended on June 30, 2005. Iâm still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 have reached the end of their support life cycles. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require additional support for Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - CVE-2005-4560:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Graphics Rendering Engine because of the way that it handles Windows Metafile (WMF) images. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted WMF image that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or opened a specially crafted attachment in e-mail. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - CVE-2005-4560:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. Also, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites, may contain malicious content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - CVE-2005-4560:

Microsoft has tested the following workaround. While this workaround will not correct the underlying vulnerability, it will help block known attack vectors.

* **Unregister the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer (Shimgvw.dll) on Windows XP Service Pack 1; Windows XP Service Pack 2; Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1**

  Microsoft has tested the following workaround. While this workaround will not correct the underlying vulnerability, it helps block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

  **Note** This workaround is intended to help protect against Web based exploit vectors and is not effective against exploits that have Windows Metafile images embedded in Word documents and other similar attack vectors.

  **Note** The following steps require Administrative privileges. We recommend that you restart the computer after you apply this workaround. Alternatively, you can log out and log back in after you apply the workaround. However, we do recommend that you restart the computer.

  To un-register Shimgvw.dll, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regsvr32 -u %windir%\system32\shimgvw.dll**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. When a dialog box appears that confirms that the process has been successful, click **OK**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** The Windows Picture and Fax Viewer will no longer start when users click a link to an image type that is associated with the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer.

  To undo this workaround after the security update has been deployed, reregister Shimgvw.dll. To do this, use this same procedure, but replace the text in step 1 with **âregsvr32 %windir%\system32\shimgvw.dllâ** (without the quotation marks).

#### FAQ for Graphics Rendering Engine Vulnerability - CVE-2005-4560:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A vulnerability exists in the way that the Graphics Rendering Engine handles specially crafted WMF images that could allow arbitrary code to be executed.

**What is the Windows Metafile (WMF) image format?**

A Windows Metafile (WMF) image is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.

For more information about image types and formats, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/320314) or visit the [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms536391.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or a specially crafted attachment in e-mail and then persuading the user to visit the page or open the attachment. If the user visited the page or opened the attachment, the attacker could cause malicious code to run in the security context of the locally logged on user. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

An attacker could also attempt to exploit this vulnerability by embedding a specially crafted Windows Metafile (WMF) image within other files such as Word documents and convince a user to open this document.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**Does this vulnerability affect image formats other than Windows Metafile (WMF)?**

The only image format that is affected is the Windows Metafile (WMF) format. It is possible, however, that an attacker could rename the file name extension of a WMF file to that of a different image format. In this situation, it is likely that the Graphics Rendering Engine would detect and render the file as a WMF image, which could allow exploitation.

**If I block files that use the .wmf file name extension, can this protect me against attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

No. The Graphics Rendering Engine does not determine file types by the file name extensions that they use. Therefore, if an attacker alters the file name extension of a WMF file, the Graphics Rendering Engine could still render the file in a way that could exploit the vulnerability.

**Does the workaround in this bulletin protect me from attempts to exploit this vulnerability through WMF images with changed extensions?**

Yes. The workaround in this bulletin help protect against WMF images with changed extensions. This workaround is only effective in scenarios where the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer (Shimgvw.dll) would have been opened. This workaround is intended to help protect against Web based exploit vectors and is not effective against exploits that have Windows Metafile images embedded in Word documents and other similar attack vectors.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Although Windows Millennium Edition does contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows Metafile (WMF) images are handled.

Specifically, the change introduced to address this vulnerability removes the support for the SETABORTPROC record type from the META\_ESCAPE record in a WMF image. This update does not remove support for ABORTPROC functions registered by application SetAbortProc() API calls.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2005-4560.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. When the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was being exploited.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code that has been published publicly that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability that is currently being exploited. The vulnerability that has been addressed has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2005-4560.

**Whatâs Microsoftâs response to the availability of third party patches for the WMF vulnerability?**

Microsoft recommends that customers download and deploy the security update associated with this security bulletin.

As a general rule, it is a best practice to obtain security updates for software vulnerabilities from the original vendor of the software. With Microsoft software, Microsoft carefully reviews and tests security updates to ensure that they are of high quality and have been evaluated thoroughly for application compatibility. In addition, Microsoftâs security updates are offered in 23 languages for all affected versions of the software simultaneously.

Microsoft cannot provide similar assurance for independent third party security updates.

**How does this vulnerability relate to the vulnerabilities that were corrected by MS05-053?**

Both vulnerabilities were in the Graphics Rendering Engine. However, this update addresses a new vulnerability that was not addressed as part of MS05-053. MS05-053 helps protect against the vulnerability that is discussed in that bulletin, but does not address this new vulnerability. This update does not replace MS05-053. You must install this update and the update that is provided as part of the MS05-053 security bulletin to help protect your system against both vulnerabilities.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB912919\Filelist

  For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB912919\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 912919 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows 2000 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.

## Microsoft Windows Metafile handler SETABORTPROC GDI Escape vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#181038

Original Release Date: 2005-12-28 | Last Revised: 2006-01-20

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows is vulnerable to remote code execution via an error in handling files using the Windows Metafile image format. Exploit code has been publicly posted and used to successfully attack fully-patched Windows XP SP2 systems. However, other versions of the Windows operating system also may be at risk.

### Description

| **Windows Graphic Display Interface (GDI)**  Windows [GDI](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnanchor/html/gdi.asp) is an interface that "enables applications to use graphics and formatted text on both the video display and the printer." GDI functions can be used to draw lines, text, curves, and other graphical elements.**GDI Escape function**The [GDI Escape](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdi/prntspol_0d6b.asp) function allows an application to access capabilities of a device that are not directly available through GDI. For example, a print job can be cancelled via a GDI Escape call.**Windows Metafile (WMF)**Microsoft [Windows Metafile](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;320314#XSLTH4204121123120121120120) (WMF) format images are graphical files that can contain both vector and bitmap-based picture information. WMF files contain a sequence of GDI function calls. The image is created by executing the GDI functions.**The problem**Certain GDI functions can have unexpected security implications. According to the MSDN document [Security Considerations: GDI](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdi/sec_gdi.asp):   Bitmaps, metafiles, and fonts are complex structures that could become corrupted. It is good practice to try to ensure that these items are uncorrupted and from a trustworthy source. Current public exploits use the [SETABORTPROC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdi/prntspol_0883.asp) GDI Escape function to execute arbitrary code when viewed. The SETABORTPROC GDI Escape is obsolete, and is provided only for compatibility with 16-bit versions of Windows. Other GDI functions, in particular the GDI Escape functions, may also have similar vulnerabilities.The public exploits currently use the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer (SHIMGVW.DLL) as an attack vector. However, please note that disabling the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer will not eliminate this vulnerability. Limited testing has shown that any application that makes the [SetWinMetaFileBits](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/metafile_1xwz.asp) GDI function call may be used to trigger the SETABORTPROC GDI Escape on Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. The GDI implementation of Windows 98 and Windows Me appears to be different in that the [PlayMetaFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/metafile_62cl.asp) GDI function seems to trigger the SETABORTPROC GDI Escape.Any application that can open a file with the associated program for that file type, such as one that uses [ShellExecute](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/functions/shellexecute.asp), can be used as an attack vector. Most email clients can be used as an attack vector for this vulnerability in this way. Windows Picture and Fax Viewer is the application that is associated with WMF and other graphic files by default on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.Internet Explorer is a common attack vector for this vulnerability because, in its default configuration, it can automatically launch the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer as the result of viewing a web page. Google Desktop Search (GDS) can also trigger the vulnerability if a malicious WMF file is placed in a location that is indexed. Other content indexing software may also be vulnerable.The following diagram illustrates several attack vectors for this vulnerability:Attack Vector Diagram |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code if the user is persuaded to view a specially crafted Windows Metafile. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**Microsoft addresses this issue with the updates listed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-001](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-001.mspx). This update disables support for SETABORTPROC in a WMF image.**Note****:** If Windows Picture and Fax Viewer was un-registered as a workaround, it can be re-registered after installation of the MS06-001 update with the following command:regsvr32 %windir%\system32\shimgvw.dllIf an unofficial hotfix was installed as a workaround, it should be uninstalled after the installation of the MS06-001 update. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds:****Disable or reset the file association for Windows Metafiles**Disabling or remapping Windows Metafile files to open a program other than the default Windows Picture and Fax Viewer may prevent exploitation via some attack vectors. Microsoft has suggested taking the following steps to disable shimgvw.dll in [Microsoft Security Advisory (912840)](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/912840.mspx):Microsoft has tested the following workaround. While this workaround will not correct the underlying vulnerability, it will help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.     + Un-register the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer (Shimgvw.dll) on Windows XP Service Pack 1; Windows XP Service Pack 2; Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1  To un-register Shimgvw.dll, follow these steps:  1. Click Start, click Run, type "regsvr32 -u %windir%\system32\shimgvw.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK. 2. A dialog box appears to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click OK to close the dialog box.  Impact of Workaround: The Windows Picture and Fax Viewer will no longer be started when users click on a link to an image type that is associated with the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer.To undo this change, re-register Shimgvw.dll by following the above steps. Replace the text in Step 1 with "regsvr32 %windir%\system32\shimgvw.dll" (without the quotation marks).**Install an unofficial hotfix**[Ilfak Guilfanov](http://www.hexblog.com/about.html) has provided a [hotfix](http://www.hexblog.com/2005/12/wmf_vuln.html) to intercept calls to the Escape function in GDI32.DLL. With this hotfix installed, calls to the obsolete SETABORTPROC GDI Escape will reportedly fail. This appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Note that this is not an official fix from Microsoft. Please take the appropriate risk assessment steps to determine whether such a hotfix should be installed in your environment.**Do not access Windows Metafiles from untrusted sources**Exploitation occurs by accessing a specially crafted Windows Metafile. By only accessing Windows Metafiles from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced.Attackers may host malicious Windows Metafiles on web sites. In order to convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use a variety of techniques to create misleading links including URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, and intentional misspellings. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting.Please note that Windows Metafile data may be saved with an extension other than WMF. A file with any extension that is associated with Windows Picture and Fax Viewer can be used to exploit this vulnerability. By default, Windows Picture and Fax Viewer is associated with the following file extensions:  BMP DIB GIF EMF JFIF JPE JPEG JPG PNG TIF TIFF WMF **Block access to Windows Metafiles at network perimeters**By blocking access to Windows Metafiles using HTTP proxies, mail gateways, and other network filter technologies, system administrators may also limit potential attack vectors.Please be aware we have confirmed that filtering based just on the WMF file extensions or MIME type application/x-msMetafile will not block all known attack vectors for this vulnerability. Filter mechanisms should be looking for any file that Microsoft Windows recognizes as a Windows Metafile by virtue of its file header. Please check with your network vendor for updated signatures. WMF files can begin with various byte sequences such as:  01 00 09 00 ...02 00 09 00 ...D7 CD C6 9A ... **Disable downloads in Internet Explorer**Disabling downloads in the Internet Explorer Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. This can be achieved by changing the Internet Zone security setting to "High." Instructions for changing zone security settings can be found in the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56). While this change does not remove the vulnerability, it does help to prevent a common attack vector. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## 1. Overview:

Microsoft has issued a security bulletin regarding a vulnerability with WMF
in Windows products (MS06-001). A description of the vulnerability can be found
in the Microsoft Advisory [here](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-001.mspx).

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be
affected by this vulnerability.

## 2. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose Operating Systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying Operating
System or applications which come with the Operating System. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerabilities directly but the underlying Microsoft platform may be
impacted. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems, Microsoft recommends
installing patches. Detailed instructions from patching the Operating System are
given by Microsoft at the following link:

<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-001.mspx>

The following Avaya software-only products run on Microsoft Operating Systems
and may have been installed on a vulnerable Microsoft Operating System.
Customers should determine on which Microsoft Operating System the product was
installed and then follow Microsoft�s guidance for applying patches:

## 4. Recommended Actions:

Avaya recommends that the Microsoft patches and/or workaround solutions are
applied for the vulnerability outlined in the above system product table.
Although certain Avaya system products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and
may be affected by these vulnerabilities, Avaya recommends that the use of
e-mail clients and Internet browsers be restricted on Avaya system products
(i.e. Outlook Express and Internet Explorer). The use of browsers should be
restricted to authorized users-only as well as limited to the operational-needs
of the product. Unrestricted access to the Intranet or Internet should be
prohibited beyond the necessary functions of the product's web administration
interface and to obtaining patches. This reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in
these applications.

Further information regarding the Microsoft patches on Avaya system products
is below:

**MS06-001** Vulnerability in Graphics Rendering Engine Could Allow Remote
Code Execution (912919): A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the
Graphics Rendering Engine because of the way that it handles Windows Metafile
(WMF) images. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a
specially crafted WMF image that could potentially allow remote code execution
if a user visited a malicious Web site or opened a specially crafted attachment
in e-mail. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take
complete control of an affected system. A local user must open an e-mail or web
site for this vulnerability to be exploited. This vulnerability impacts
S8100/DefinityOne/IP600 Media Servers, Modular Messaging Message Application
Server (MAS), and Unified Communication Center. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) had assigned the name [CVE-2005-4560](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4560)
to this issue.

Instead of shopping for Christmas they keep creating and spreading new downloaders. We just got a few reports about a new Bagle-related downloader that is now being spammed as a ZIP attachment containing a file named DFC00027.EXE. The mass-mailer that is responsible for this Bagle round was uploaded to one of the websites that are monitored by old Bagle downloaders some time ago. I hope that this round will be as short as the [previous](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-122005#00000744) one.   | **Tuesday, December 20, 2005** | | --- | | --- | |  | [**Sober does something good for a change**](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00000745) | Posted by Mikko @ 12:35 GMT | | --- | --- | | --- | |   Remember [Sober.Y](https://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/sober_y.shtml)?

The downloaded file is a minor variant of the previous Bagle mass-mailer, we detect it as [W32/Bagle.FC@mm](https://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/bagle_fc.shtml).

Although the language used in these emails is so horribly bad it's just funny.   | **Tuesday, December 13, 2005** | | --- | | --- | |  | [**Fake McAfee download links**](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00000733) | Posted by Mikko @ 13:52 GMT | | --- | --- | | --- | |   We've received several reports of emails, warning about a new virus called "Kongo31.XRW" (which doesn't exist).    | [**Upcoming conferences in early 2006**](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00000732) | Posted by Jarno @ 08:49 GMT | | --- | --- | | --- | |   When looking at Anti-Virus research conference calendar, the time after new year seems to be quite active indeed.   | **Sunday, December 11, 2005** | | --- | | --- | |  | [**Fishing on the amazon**](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00000731) | Posted by Mikko @ 21:00 GMT | | --- | --- | | --- | |   Almost any online shop can be a target of phishing scams. Amazon.com, being one of the largest online shops in the world, is a popular target.   | **Friday, December 9, 2005** | | --- | | --- | |  | [**Nordea.fi phish redux**](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00000730) | Posted by Era @ 16:32 GMT | | --- | --- | | --- | |   nordea phishing site   | **Thursday, December 8, 2005** | | --- | | --- | |  | [**How Sober activates**](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00000729) | Posted by Mikko @ 16:02 GMT | | --- | --- | | --- | |   First Sober variant was found in October 2003.

This question is not that easy to answer with precise numbers, as there are very few malware named "Rootkit.Win32.Something". Most malware that uses rootkit techniques is called "Backdoor.Win32.Something", "Worm.Win32.Something", "Virtool.Win32.Something", etc. However, since our [BlackLight rootkit scanner](https://www.f-secure.com/blacklight/) (generic rootkit detection) has now been available for 9 months we have a pretty good feel on what the rootkit menace currently is all about.   | **Monday, December 5, 2005** | | --- | | --- | |  | [**Old skool virus fighting**](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00000726) | Posted by Mikko @ 23:13 GMT | | --- | --- | | --- | |   I was searching my hard drive for something else and I happened to run into this: a story I wrote over 12 years ago. It's about analysing a virus called Crepate. I hope you enjoy it.   | **Thursday, December 1, 2005** | | --- | | --- | |  | [**We just bought a company**](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00000725) | Posted by Mikko @ 07:09 GMT | | --- | --- | | --- | |   After announcing [F-Secure Messaging Security Gateway](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-092005#00000649) two months ago, we're going deeper into the hardware appliance business.
