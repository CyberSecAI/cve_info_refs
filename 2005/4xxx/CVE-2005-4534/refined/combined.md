Package        : bugzilla
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-4534 CVE-2006-5453
Debian Bug     : 395094 329387

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Bugzilla
bug tracking system, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2005-4534

    Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered that insecure temporary
    file usage may lead to denial of service through a symlink attack.

CVE-2006-5453

    Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities may lead to injection
    of arbitrary web script code.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.16.7-7sarge2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) these problems have been
fixed in version 2.22.1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.22.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your bugzilla packages.

Package: bugzilla
Version: 2.16.7-7sarge1
Priority: critical
Tags: patch sarge woody

I sent this mail to the security team a while back and forwarded it upstream
too. Since this bug is now public
(<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=305353>), I'm opening up a
ticket in the BTS for easier tracking of this issue. Notice that a DSA fixing
this should also fix #321567.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi there,

Bugzilla (bugzilla_2.14.2-0woody4 and bugzilla_2.16.7-7sarge1) contains
a script which is used to synchronise the bugzilla user database with
the shadow password database called syncshadowdb. This script is intented
to be run by the Bug Tracking System.

The script uses temporary files in an unsafe way since it selects a
name for the file based on PID and does not make any effort to determine
if the file exists and if it is a symlink. A local user could use this
to direct symlink attacks and overwrite files that the Bug Tracking System
has access to.

The attached (untested) patch, which uses File::Temp should fix this issue
and prevent any symlink attacks.

Regards

Javier

Hi,

I'm the maintainer of the backup manager package.
There are currently one security issue in our sarge package (0.5.7-7sarge1).

I made a package with the patch submitted against the bug #329387 which
closes the issue.

Can we plan to upload that package to security updates?

The package is available on my repository:
    deb-src <http://www.sukria.net/debian> ./

Of course I was speaking about bugzilla, not backup-manager, sorry!

Umh... I don't have a CVE name to share anymore.  Will provide one
when I got a new bunch.

Do you happen to know about the package in woody?

> Can we plan to upload that package to security updates?

Yes.  I've copied it into the private security archive.

Next steps:

 a) what about woody

 b) what about sid

 c) release advisory

Well, I don't know. Where can I grab woody's source packages?

As soon as I know where to fetch woody's sources, I will tell you.

Sid is not affected, the vulnerable script does not exist in the sid
version.

Woody is vulnerable as well, the vulnerable code is present in
syncshadowdb:164

Alexis, you can download the Woody sources through packages.debian.org.

```
FYI, the reporter was mistaken, the upstream bug was NOT public.  He
could see it because he reported it.  It might as well be now.  (I just
removed the security flag from it, so it is indeed public now).

The patch he supplied (while a good start) was stated to be untested,
and we also determined that it did not, in fact, solve the problem
(because it re-opened the file from scratch after creating the secure
temp file, rather than using the handle passed back from File::Temp).

We have an upstream patch ready to go, which was awaiting the 2.16.11
release expected in the next couple weeks.  No point in waiting now.

Thanks!  I'm not getting any traction on trying to push a full release
out for this.  Seems nobody cares about the 2.16 branch anymore (it's
two stable releases back, and due for EOL on security support by us in a
couple weeks anyway).  Or it could be that anyone who cares is still on
Christmas vacation.  Anyhow, I'll have an advisory going out in a few
hours which just points at the patch.  In reality there's probably very
few sites using this feature.  There will be a 2.16.11 release, just not
tonight.

I guess that I've already answered this mail, but since I can't find
a reply, I better reply now (maybe again).

Btw. this issue has been assigned [CVE-2005-4534](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4534), so please add it to the
changelog if you prepare a fixed package for woody as well.

tags 329387 + pending
thanks

Hello,

I've packaged a new version of bugzilla for closing a security issue
reported on sarge:

<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=329387>

This package is 2.16.7-7sarge2 and is available here:

<http://www.sukria.net/debian/source/bugzilla_2.16.7-7sarge2_i386.changes>
<http://www.sukria.net/debian/source/bugzilla_2.16.7-7sarge2.diff.gz>
<http://www.sukria.net/debian/source/bugzilla_2.16.7-7sarge2.dsc>
<http://www.sukria.net/debian/source/bugzilla_2.16.7.orig.tar.gz>

It only provides the upstream patch (backported from 2.16.11) that
closes that security issue : [CVE-2005-4534](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4534)

If an upload is possible to the security archive, that would be great.

Thanks.

The distribution should be stable-security instead of
testing-proposed-updates. Please also remove all the i18n updates:

Ok, I'll make a new package with the correct distribution.

The i18n updates are automatically made by the build process, it's only
timtestamp updates, how can I safely disable this?

You simply build the source package before you are working on the
binary package and don't build the source package after you've built
the binary packages.

Subject: Bugzilla: Unsafe use of temporary files in the syncshadow script
User-Agent: Mutt/1.5.9i
[ Note: this is a different bug from the one I reported in the BTS
since it affects the stable / oldstable release and not the testing /
unstable branches ]
Hi there,
Bugzilla (bugzilla\_2.14.2-0woody4 and bugzilla\_2.16.7-7sarge1) contains
a script which is used to synchronise the bugzilla user database with
the shadow password database called syncshadowdb. This script is intented
to be run by the Bug Tracking System.
The script uses temporary files in an unsafe way since it selects a
name for the file based on PID and does not make any effort to determine
if the file exists and if it is a symlink. A local user could use this
to direct symlink attacks and overwrite files that the Bug Tracking System
has access to.
The attached (untested) patch, which uses File::Temp should fix this issue
and prevent any symlink attacks.
Regards
Javier

The patch that was attached to the email
Something about this implementation bugs me... tempfile returns a filehandle,
but we redirect output to the file later, instead, which opens it again, which
will probably fail because tempfile already opened it for writing.
Instead of redirecting STDOUT to the filename, we should redirect it to the
filehandle that was returned from tempfile.
Also, just as a point of comparison, other places in the code where we use
File::Temp don't import any functions from File::Temp on the use line, and
explicitly spell out File::Temp::tempfile(). It'll still work the way you did
it, it's just nice to keep the code consistent sometimes. :)

This assumes that the 'cat' command is in /bin, which we don't know (what OS are we running on?)
Oh, on the other hand, this is 2.16, which required hacks to run on anything other than Linux anyway. Maybe that'll work.
I want to test this before I r+ it. Setting up the test environment for this particular situation is going to be a pain though, so it probably won't be tonight.

On the other hand, Teemu stated he tested it already, and he has a very good prior history of accurate testing. By inspection this looks good to me, and it compiles.

The original reported (jfs) mistakenly thought we'd opened this to the public because he could see it (which in fact it was only because he was CCed on the bug, and thus could see it), and filed this in Debian's public bug system on September 21st: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=329387>
Secunia just picked it up this morning: <http://secunia.com/advisories/18218/>

I must make an apology to Javier, this was never intended to be sat on for so long, and he's obviously used to how Debian does things, and not how we do things. We all let it sit expecting Javier to update the patch after it was reviewed, and then that never happened. And I'm as much at fault because I failed to indicate in my review that he should update it.
Since Teemu doesn't have checkin privs, I'm checking this in.

Forgot to mark this fixed when I checked in.
FYI, It's likely going to be tomorrow some time before the advisory actually happens. We're still too close to Christmas, and I can't get all the right people in the right place at the same time to make it happen. :(Status: ASSIGNED → RESOLVEDClosed: 19 years agoResolution: --- → FIXEDWhiteboard: [ready for 2.16.11] [does not affect 2.18/2.20/trunk] → [fixed in 2.16.11] [does not affect 2.18/2.20/trunk]

Not that it matters much now, but wouldn't it be a good idea to close the $tmpfh filehandle before running "/bin/cat $tempfile", even though buffering is disabled?
open STDOUT, ">&SAVEOUT"; # redirect back to original stream
close($tmpfh);

The File::Temp construct that we're using to create the temp file automatically deletes the file when we close it, so if we did that, there would be nothing there to cat. Doing a $tmpfh->flush() might not be a bad idea. Reading the documentation, having autoflush enabled ($|=1) is probably sufficient though.

Bugzilla Security Advisory
==========================
December 27, 2005
Summary
=======
Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.
This advisory covers an insecure temporary filename handling issue in
versions of Bugzilla prior to 2.16.11 which make use of the shadow
database feature. Versions 2.18 and newer are not affected, nor are
older installations which do not use the shadow database.
Vulnerability Details
=====================
Class: Insecure temporary filename handling
Impact: Privilege escalation
Where: Local system
Versions: 2.9 through 2.16.10. Newer versions are not
affected.
Description: Bugzilla uses a script called syncshadowdb to manually
replicate data between a master database and a slave.
The script uses temporary files in an unsafe way since it
selects a name for the file based on PID and does not make
any effort to determine if the file exists and if it is a
symlink. A local user could use this to direct symlink
attacks and overwrite files that Bugzilla has access to.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=305353
CVE Name: CVE-2005-4534
Vulnerability Solutions
=======================
The fix for this security issue will be included in the upcoming 2.16.11
release of Bugzilla. In the meantime, the patch to fix this issue can
be obtained from the URL listed in the reference above. The patch only
touches the syncshadowdb file.
Please note that Bugzilla version 2.16.\* is an older release and very
near end-of-life of its security support. Users are advised to upgrade
to the latest stable release as soon as possible to continue to receive
security support.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
