  "CVE-2005-4134": {
    "description": "Web pages with extremely long titles cause subsequent launches of the browser to appear to \"hang\" for up to a few minutes, or even crash if the computer has insufficient memory.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow issue related to how browsers handle and store document titles in history files, specifically when the title is excessively long.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition where the browser hangs, becomes unresponsive or crashes during startup. In severe cases, systems with insufficient memory may experience a crash upon browser launch. The condition persists until the malicious entry is removed from the browser history or the history file is manually deleted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web pages with extremely long titles",
      "Malicious websites"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a web page with an extremely long title. This can be done through a malicious website or by injecting the malicious code into a website.",
    "additional_details": "Some sources indicate that this vulnerability can cause a complete system crash (blue screen of death) if sufficient memory resources are not available. This vulnerability affects various browsers, including Mozilla Firefox, Netscape, K-Meleon, and potentially others based on the same rendering engine. Disabling history saving or utilizing browser extensions like NoScript can provide temporary mitigations."
