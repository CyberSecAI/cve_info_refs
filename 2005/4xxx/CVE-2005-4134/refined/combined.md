# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-03

## Long document title causes startup denial of service

Announced
February 1, 2006
Reporter
ZIPLOCK
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.8
* Firefox 1.5.0.1
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.13
* SeaMonkey 1

### Description

Web pages with extremely long titles--the public demonstration
had a title 2.5 million characters long--cause subsequent
launches of the browser to appear to "hang" for up to a few
minutes, or even crash if the computer has insufficient memory.

Once affected this condition will recur every time the browser
is started until the item expires from the saved browsing history
or the user deletes the file `history.dat` from
the user profile directory.

**Update (13 April 2006)**

Updated versions of Firefox 1.0 and the Mozilla Suite 1.7
have been released containing this fix.

### Workaround

This problem can be prevented in vulnerable versions by turning off
the saving of browser history. In Firefox:

1. Open the **Options** dialog from the **Tools** menu
2. Select the **Privacy** icon
3. In the **History** section set the remembered duration to
   **0** days

The steps for the Mozilla Suite are similar

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla
Firefox.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2005-4134

    Web pages with extremely long titles cause subsequent launches of
    the browser to appear to "hang" for up to a few minutes, or even
    crash if the computer has insufficient memory.  [MFSA-2006-03]

CVE-2006-0292

    The Javascript interpreter does not properly dereference objects,
    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
    execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-01]

CVE-2006-0293

    The function allocation code allows attackers to cause a denial of
    service and possibly execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-01]

CVE-2006-0296

    XULDocument.persist() did not validate the attribute name,
    allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary XML and JavaScript code
    into localstore.rdf that would be read and acted upon during
    startup.  [MFSA-2006-05]

CVE-2006-0748

    An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day
    Initiative reported that an invalid and nonsensical ordering of
    table-related tags can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
    [MFSA-2006-27]

CVE-2006-0749

    A particular sequence of HTML tags can cause memory corruption
    that can be exploited to exectute arbitary code.  [MFSA-2006-18]

CVE-2006-1727

    Georgi Guninski reported two variants of using scripts in an XBL
    control to gain chrome privileges when the page is viewed under
    "Print Preview".under "Print Preview".  [MFSA-2006-25]

CVE-2006-1728

    "shutdown" discovered that the crypto.generateCRMFRequest method
    can be used to run arbitrary code with the privilege of the user
    running the browser, which could enable an attacker to install
    malware.  [MFSA-2006-24]

CVE-2006-1729

    Claus Jørgensen reported that a text input box can be pre-filled
    with a filename and then turned into a file-upload control,
    allowing a malicious website to steal any local file whose name
    they can guess.  [MFSA-2006-23]

CVE-2006-1730

    An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day
    Initiative discovered an integer overflow triggered by the CSS
    letter-spacing property, which could be exploited to execute
    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-22]

CVE-2006-1731

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that some internal functions return
    prototypes instead of objects, which allows remote attackers to
    conduct cross-site scripting attacks.  [MFSA-2006-19]

CVE-2006-1732

    "shutdown" discovered that it is possible to bypass same-origin
    protections, allowing a malicious site to inject script into
    content from another site, which could allow the malicious page to
    steal information such as cookies or passwords from the other
    site, or perform transactions on the user's behalf if the user
    were already logged in.  [MFSA-2006-17]

CVE-2006-1733

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that the compilation scope of privileged
    built-in XBL bindings is not fully protected from web content and
    can still be executed which could be used to execute arbitrary
    JavaScript, which could allow an attacker to install malware such
    as viruses and password sniffers.  [MFSA-2006-16]

CVE-2006-1734

    "shutdown" discovered that it is possible to access an internal
    function object which could then be used to run arbitrary
    JavaScriptcode with full permissions of the user running the
    browser, which could be used to install spyware or viruses.
    [MFSA-2006-15]

CVE-2006-1735

    It is possible to create JavaScript functions that would get
    compiled with the wrong privileges, allowing an attacker to run
    code of their choice with full permissions of the user running the
    browser, which could be used to install spyware or viruses.
    [MFSA-2006-14]

CVE-2006-1736

    It is possible to trick users into downloading and saving an
    executable file via an image that is overlaid by a transparent
    image link that points to the executable.  [MFSA-2006-13]

CVE-2006-1737

    An integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service and possibly execute arbitrary bytecode via JavaScript
    with a large regular expression.  [MFSA-2006-11]

CVE-2006-1738

    An unspecified vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service.  [MFSA-2006-11]

CVE-2006-1739

    Certain Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can cause an out-of-bounds
    array write and buffer overflow that could lead to a denial of
    service and the possible execution of arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-11]

CVE-2006-1740

    It is possible for remote attackers to spoof secure site
    indicators such as the locked icon by opening the trusted site in
    a popup window, then changing the location to a malicious site.
    [MFSA-2006-12]

CVE-2006-1741

    "shutdown" discovered that it is possible to inject arbitrary
    JavaScript code into a page on another site using a modal alert to
    suspend an event handler while a new page is being loaded.  This
    could be used to steal confidential information.  [MFSA-2006-09]

CVE-2006-1742

    Igor Bukanov discovered that the JavaScript engine does not
    properly handle temporary variables, which might allow remote
    attackers to trigger operations on freed memory and cause memory
    corruption, causing memory corruption.  [MFSA-2006-10]

CVE-2006-1790

    A regression fix that could lead to memory corruption allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-11]

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.2-2.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Solution:**
 - Do not browse untrusted web sites when browsing trusted sites.

 Workarounds provided by the
researcher:
 - 1. Check the URL address opening new dialog box titled as 'Explorer User Prompt' and
containing text like 'Script Prompt' etc. If the domain contains multiple domain suffixes, for example
www.real-address.com.non-real-address.com, use the following workaround method:
 - 2. When typing
sensitive information to a Web site password-type dialog boxes, be sure that this site is a legitimate
site.
 ***Update:*** Use special security features included to some browsers,
IP-URL Checker etc. to resolve the origin of the Web page. Use popup blocker in some situations.
 Move
the JavaScript dialog box from covering the original URL address at location bar.
 NOTE: Using multiple
domain suffixes may indicate a spoofing attempt.
 In Mozilla-based browsers: Those dialog boxes
mentioned are titled as [JavaScript Application] (Javascript-sovelma in Finnish etc.).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla
Thunderbird.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2005-2353

    The "run-mozilla.sh" script allows local users to create or
    overwrite arbitrary files when debugging is enabled via a symlink
    attack on temporary files.

CVE-2005-4134

    Web pages with extremely long titles cause subsequent launches of
    the browser to appear to "hang" for up to a few minutes, or even
    crash if the computer has insufficient memory.  [MFSA-2006-03]

CVE-2006-0292

    The Javascript interpreter does not properly dereference objects,
    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or

|  | |

From the URL:
Basically firefox logs all kinda of URL data in it's history.dat file,
this little script will set a really large topic and Firefox will then
save that topic into it's history.dat.. The next time that firefox is
opened, it will instantly crash due to a buffer overflow -- this will
happen everytime until you manually delete the history.dat file -- which
most users won't figure out.
We're probably blowing Mork's little mind, and it'll be easier to defend in the history code than in Mork.
People are reporting varying results in #developers.

Trying with a clean profile and a recent trunk build on Windows XP, I get a slight delay when clicking the link, and then an approximately 1.5 minute hang on the next startup. Everything seems to work fine after that, including the Go menu.

I didn't get a crash in Camino (branch), but startup time was hugely increased.
In morkSpool::SpillPutc, mork is reading in a morkCoil, growing it 512 bytes at a time, and on each grow, copying the old buffer into the new buffer.

This is being reported as 'remote exploit' in the news:
<http://digg.com/security/Kill_Firefox_1.5_with_remote_exploit>
While it's not a security issue it should be fixed fast as malicious users may start using it now that it's known.

What about using Sanitize feature, it will empty the broken History.dat when FF is closed. Setting 'Visited pages' to zero is not always a good decision. This Sanitizing would be a workaround?

Please change OS to "All" because the problem is also present in FF1.5 under Linux.
Everything gets very slow and FF will not be usable (also after restarts) until the history.dat file have been removed (or the wrong entry have been deleted).

I wasn't able to reproduce the crash on startup with 1.5 under linux, OSX, or Windows; it's pretty slow on startup, but recovers (usually after about 15-30 seconds).
A simple fix would be to change history to only store a max of 512 characters of the document title; however, you can still do the same thing with the location (e.g. append #AAAAAAAAAAAAAA....), and we can't truncate that easily.

Can anyone reproduce a crash? I can't. I see the same stupid Mork code on the stack that Gavin reported in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=319004#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - CVE-2005-4134 overlong document.title setting can corrupt history data, causing non-responsive temporary hang (crash?) on subsequent startups"), and when that O(N^2) alg completes, the browser finishes starting up and seems in good health.
Who is claiming an exploitable crash? Where is the stack backtrace or other evidence of exploitability? The "PoC" doesn't prove its assertion, and all I see is a quadratic growth rate design botch in Mork, resulting in a fairly short non-responsive state (not a true hang) on startup.
We need more info to do something about this, unless it turns out not to be exploitable (in which case, the PoC author's name is mud in my book).

We can clamp both URI and title at some generous but not-too-large upper bound (64K, e.g.), but we might want to fix the O(n^2) bug too.

I've also tried this with windows with a 15000\*10000 string (150MB or so); we baloon up to 300MB+ memory usage (UTF16), but no crash. On restart, though, memory usage kept jumping between 68MB and 75MB, never really growing -- I didn't have a debug build handy, but it looks like it's just mork being really, really slow. The same thing on linux; I have it up in the debugger now, and mork is happily getc()'ing and putc()'ing one character at a time.. it'll take it a while to get to 150MB, malloc'ing 512 more chars at a time and memcpy'ing the whole thing over.
Note that on windows I was a little worried that we may be overflowing some OS buffer when setting the window title; however, the WM\_SETTEXT message takes a null-terminated string, so we're ok there. This is just a really crappy perf bug that we ought to fix.
(IE seems to only store the original page title in history, before it's munged by script.)

No, that bug involves BiDi layout. This is a history database O(n^2) bug.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=319004&attachment=205318)

This patch clamps the history service's URIs and page titles to 65k.
(Can someone who can wrap their head around our string API better than myself tell me how to accomplish what I want here without a string copy if the string is already less than 65k?)

The above two patches fix things for me; I get fairly quick startup even with super long strings in my history file (saved before the 64k patch). I've got a third patch that has mork using realloc(), but it's more involved as it has to munge mork APIs to add Realloc() to its crazyness. I'll attach it later, but we should probably not apply it. The above two things should fix the problem.

I can confirm the "DoS" with firefox-1.0.7 on a gentoo linux system. Upon executing the javascript, both X and xfce4 immediatly hang, followed momentarly after with xfce4 then crashing. Killing X is nessessary to restart the system.
After X and the WM have been restarted, firefox stars as usual.

Maybe XFCE can't handle extremely long window titles? That would be an XFCE problem, not a Firefox problem. Though maybe Firefox should truncate them.

just had some of my fellow devs test this and came up with the following results:
ff-1.5.0 + gnome(gtk): WM/X crash
ff-1.0.7 + xfce4(gtk): WM/X crash
ff-1.5.0 + kde(qt): hang on startup until history.dat is removed
so no, I wouldn't call it a xfce bug, more likly a gtk bug.

Still, though, not a Firefox bug, though if Firefox truncated really long titles the crashes would probably be prevented.
(Not completely bugspam, but I'll shut up now. :P )

I see no crash with the X and gtk as shipped (and patched up) with Fedora Core 4.

I am able to reproduce the crash on this machine:
AMD 2100+ w/ 512 MB PC2100, running Windows XP Pro SP2 and FF1.5. The test page was served by Apache 2.0.55, also on the same machine.
I had to run the "exploit" several times before FF finally hosed. The first four times, I go to "Go" on the FF menu, and I would see "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA....". I close FF and reopen, now "Go" shows "heh" instead. Run the "exploit" again, same results. FF runs noticeably slower after the third try. On the fifth, FF hangs with "Opening <http://www.yahoo.com>" in the status bar and a blank page. One Three-Finger-Salute later, and FF again crashes on try 6 with a "Looking up <http://www.yahoo.com>" message in the status bar. I tried FF about 5 or 6 more times with the same results. Fixed the problem by deleting "C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\vm8tginr.default\history.dat". FF works flawlessly afterwards!

Looks like we can't make the basis case for size (mBlob\_Size) be a power of two, but the patch copes by testing > 65536 to switch from binary-exponential to linear growth.

You would think, except I couldn't get the incantations to work right. I'll try again tomorrow morning.
And yes, the bloat impact needs to be measured. If it's significant, maybe we can have mork realloc "coils" down to their actual size once they're read in.

This will always result in a copy, no? I think we want to avoid given that the majority of strings passed in here will be less than HISTORY\_STRING\_LENGTH\_MAX.

We can't clamp the URI just here, we have to fix all the callsites if at all.

There is some intrinsic limitation of Mork that we are
concerned about here, right? I think it would be good
to describe that intrinsic limitation here.
As for page titles, I think it would be find to limit
them by much more. Maybe 1024 characters (or at most
4096) is enough title for any page?

You could probably use StringHead to simplify this slightly.
nsAutoString titleString(StringHead(aTitle, HISTORY\_STRING\_LENGTH\_MAX));
Ideally, the string code should be able to optimize away any
copying here if aTitle already contains a ref-counted buffer.
However, it does not do that today. Probably worth filing a
bug to make it so.
You could write code like this if you really wanted to avoid
the copy:
const PRUnichar \*titleString;
nsAutoString titleBuf;
if (aTitle.Length() > 1024 || !aTitle.IsTerminated()) {
titleBuf = StringHead(aTitle, 1024);
titleString = titleBuf.get();
} else {
titleString = aTitle.BeginReading();
}
>+ if (URISpec.Length() > HISTORY\_STRING\_LENGTH\_MAX)
>+ URISpec.Left(URISpec, HISTORY\_STRING\_LENGTH\_MAX);
Hrm... I'm not sure that it is good to insert a modified URI into
global history. Perhaps if the URI is that long, we should just
abort the history operation.

There is no crash and the browser behaves reasonably, in the sense of being

Not with the other patch to this bug. This is all just FYI, not to detract from your review comment cited above.
The underlying limitation in Mork was a bad O(n^2) growth rate (growing a buffer by 512 bytes at a time, indefinitely). But we want a sane upper bound on title and URL for history's own sake, even with the Mork flaw fixed. With the Mork fix, Mork grows binary-exponentially till 64K and then switches to linear, so faces an O(n^2) cliff that's less severe.
So I suggested to vlad that he make the history code clamp at that threshold, so the only growth rate we ever see is O(log(n). So (so!) you are right, there is a magic coupling here to comment! ;-)

Just happened across this from the sr request earlier.. but I have to agree with darin that actually using modifed URIs seems like a bad idea... the operation should just fail.
At best it means that long links appear visited when they aren't.. at worst there's going to be some kind of exploit because of some other flaw in history or mork...
i.e. someone is going to figure out how to make one URI look like another because of the truncation.

Ok; how about this: we do a length check on the Title and the URI; if either exceeds 64k, we return NS\_OK and silently ignore the history entry. How's that sound?

I'm not a developer so my opinion isn't greatly important, but I think it should be safe enough to just snip long titles but still store them. Snipping URIs sounds like a bad idea because the shorter version might actually be a different valid page, but the titles aren't important like that.
So, do the NS\_OK and silently not adding long URIs, but just chop down long titles.

Any URI 64K or longer is a fake one generated by a nasty script, I say (anyone with a counterexample from a real server, please cite it). So we could bail on overlong URI too, and never break any real case that matters.
Some kind of message dumped to the JS console might be appropriate, to let savvy users and debuggers-in-the-field know what happened, but NS\_OK is the only way to be sure we won't propagate a failure up into the user's face, or into a latent bug.

It works here.
seems it depends on how much ram you've. i got 2 blue screens, after
changed the code a bit. the first one was about MEMORY\_MANAGEMENT and
the second one was a PAGE\_FAULT\_IN\_NONPAGED\_AREA. And both occurs
without user interaction, the second one i just've opened firefox, not
the bug file (maybe cache ?)
ps: i've 1Gb of ram

The history system refuses to store data: URIs:
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/toolkit/components/history/src/nsGlobalHistory.cpp#581>
Odd that it does not include javascript URIs since those could be very long as well if they are being used to pass around data.

I'm fine with this, even though it always copies the string.. trying to make it not do that seems to be a black art.
I think blake (mrbkap) was doing another patch, that fixed the actual calls to set the document title to clamp to 4k. We should probably take that one as well.

> A quick workarround is to set this setting:
> user\_pref("capability.policy.default.HTMLDocument.title.set","noAccess");
It should be noted that setting that pref only works around a JavaScript version of this PoC. It was incredibly easy to modify it to use server-side scripting such as PHP and see the same effects, and even to generate a plain HTML file that does the trick. Many people seem to think that using the NoScript extension or otherwise blocking JavaScript protects them, which simply isn't true (as I assume most of you know).
Also, by increasing the number of iterations of the first loop to 10000 and the second to 5000, my Mac started to completely lock up and become unusable. After a few minutes, I got a warning that I was low on disk space, so I reset my machine. While I don't remember for sure what my free disk space was before, I don't have much less now, and there seems to be about a 2.5GB discrepency between what I can identify as taking up space and how much space is being used. My first thought was some sort of cache file in my Firefox profile, but that doesn't seem to be the case; my profile is only about 357.6MB (mostly due to [bug 157152](/show_bug.cgi?id=157152 "RESOLVED INVALID - read-only/hidden bookmarks.html (or bookmarks.html.moztmp) causes creation of bookmarks-{n+1}.html") I assume; I'm up to bookmarks-1283.html now)...

Using NoScript version 1.1.3.5 \*is\* actually effective also against server-side exploits, since it truncates document titles to 255 characters by default.
In facts, I released 1.1.3.5 as soon as I became aware of this bug and of the general belief you're referring to (Dec 7, IIRC).
Of course you're right about blocking JavaScript otherwise (e.g. through the Firefox Content Options).

We're missing a fix for [bug 322167](/show_bug.cgi?id=322167 "REOPENED - Title chopping from bug 319004 might split a character in the middle"), although that doesn't seem very serious. The number of real titles > 4096 characters has to be exceptionally small and the worst that would happen is to have a dangling byte at the end of the title (don't know how serious that is). I hope to get a fix for that in the next day or so.Status: NEW → RESOLVEDClosed: 19 years agoResolution: --- → FIXED

I believe we decided not to touch mork at all, and just fix the caller -- the bad growth handling is just a slowdown, and not a big deal with a 65k cap. Noone seemed to be sure how fragile mork was, no matter how safe the patch looked.

Re the mork patch, I doubt it's going to break anything, but it might increase Mork's memory usage substantially. I'd need to check what kind of data this code is used on, and the lifetime of the storage it allocates. If this memory stays allocated while the db is open, I'd suggest only doing the doubling of the size if the string is > 2K or so, since strings like that are going to be relatively rare.

See [comment #38](/show_bug.cgi?id=319004#c38 "VERIFIED FIXED - CVE-2005-4134 overlong document.title setting can corrupt history data, causing non-responsive temporary hang (crash?) on subsequent startups") :) I only measure global history though, and not other mork clients.

Attached patch

[Port to Firefox 1.0.7](attachment.cgi?id=210094&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=210094&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=319004&attachment=210094)

Just for reference, 3 out of the hunks failed when applying to aviary 1.0.x, so this is an patch which applies to aviary. The patch looks almost identical to what was checked in. The patch failed to apply mostly because of surrounding code changing.

Advisory 2006-03 <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/mfsa2006-03.html> indicates that this flaw is also in Mozilla but no references seem to be here about fixing this. This Advisory does indicate to set the History Duration to 0 days.
Is someone fixing this for Mozilla Suite and when will it be available?
thanks,

It's already fixed for the Mozilla Suite. The keyword "fixed1.7.13" is telling it. You have to wait for the next bugfix release 1.7.13 of Mozilla.

# Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200604-18**

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Suite allow attacks ranging from script
execution with elevated privileges to information leaks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.13** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.13** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.13** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.13** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that
includes a mail and news reader.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in Mozilla Suite. Version
1.7.13 was released to fix them.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft malicious web pages or emails that
would leverage these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code
with elevated privileges, steal local files, cookies or other
information from web pages or emails, and spoof content. Some of these
vulnerabilities might even be exploited to execute arbitrary code with
the rights of the user running the client.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.13"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.13"
```

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200604-12**

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox allow attacks ranging from
execution of script code with elevated privileges to information leaks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.8** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.8** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation web browser from the
Mozilla project.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in Mozilla Firefox. Versions
1.0.8 and 1.5.0.2 were released to fix them.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft malicious web pages that would
leverage these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code with
elevated privileges, steal local files, cookies or other information
from web pages, and spoof content. Some of these vulnerabilities might
even be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the
browser user.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.8"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.8"
```
