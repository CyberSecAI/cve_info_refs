Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-4360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an unchecked buffer within an object used by the Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.1 URL parser to maintain statistics on hosted applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability. The lack of proper bounds checking when handling URL requests leads to a memory corruption when processing specially crafted URL requests.
- **Remote Code Execution:** This buffer overflow can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Complete System Control:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can run arbitrary code with the privileges of the local system account. This would allow them to install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, with the attacker sending specially crafted URL requests to a web page hosted on a vulnerable IIS 5.1 server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to craft malicious URL requests to trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Target Environment:** The attacker needs to target a system running Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 with IIS 5.1 installed.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was originally disclosed as a denial-of-service (DoS) issue but was later found to be exploitable for remote code execution.
- The vulnerability is specific to IIS 5.1 on Windows XP Professional SP2 and is not present in other versions of IIS or Windows operating systems.
- IIS 5.1 is not part of a default Windows XP Professional SP2 installation, making it a less common attack target.
- Microsoft released a security update to address the vulnerability by validating memory requests within IIS.
- Workarounds include using URLScan 2.5 or blocking access to port 80 (TCP)

**Mitigating Factors**
- IIS 5.1 is not installed by default on Windows XP Professional SP2

**Affected Software:**
- Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 with Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.1
