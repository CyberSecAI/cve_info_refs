    {
      "source": "www.ush.it_90714d35_20250125_130406.html",
      "root_cause": "Lack of input validation for the 'lastnumber' GET parameter in stat.php",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unfiltered 'lastnumber' parameter",
        "Exposure of configuration file (stat.cfg) via direct access",
        "Exposure of log database via the 'directory' value in config file",
        "Application-level Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource consumption with large int inputs",
         "XSS via the referer field",
        "Disk and quota misuse due to large referrer fields and lack of database rotation"

      "impact": "XSS allows attackers to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript, configuration and log database exposure can lead to sensitive information disclosure, DoS attacks can make the application unavailable, disk space can be exhausted by large referers.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "GET requests to stat.php with malicious 'lastnumber' parameter",
        "Direct GET request to /stat/stat.cfg to expose configuration",
        "GET requests using 'directory' value from stat.cfg to access log database",
        "GET requests to stat.php with large integer for 'lastnumber' to cause a DoS",
