- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `P_SUGID` flag was being unconditionally cleared during exec, which is incorrect behavior.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect handling of the `P_SUGID` flag during exec.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Incorrectly clearing the `P_SUGID` flag could lead to privilege escalation by allowing programs to retain set-user-ID privileges when they shouldn't.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation involves executing a program with set-user-ID bits set.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to execute a set-user-ID program.

This commit fixes the issue by only clearing the `P_SUGID` flag when the real and effective user and group IDs match.
