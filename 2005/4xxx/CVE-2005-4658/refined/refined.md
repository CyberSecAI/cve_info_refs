Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-4658:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in ASPKnowledgebase, a software by www.asp-programmers.com. Specifically, several input fields are vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the admin form-fields, allowing malicious script injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are automatically executed when a user visits the affected page.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, including cookie theft and other unauthorized actions within the user's browser context.
- The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session on the vulnerable website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves compromising the logon of ASPKnowledgebase to gain administrative privileges.
- With administrative access, the attacker can then inject XSS payloads into the admin form fields.
- Once injected, these scripts are executed when users visit the pages where these fields are displayed

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have compromised the login credentials to gain administrative privileges to the vulnerable application to inject the malicious script.
- The attacker needs to know the existence of vulnerable input fields within the administrative interface of ASPKnowledgebase.

**Additional Details**

- The advisory mentions that a previous advisory by the same author described how to compromise the login, indicating this vulnerability needs to be chained with a login bypass/compromise.
