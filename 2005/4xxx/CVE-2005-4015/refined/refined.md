{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `lastnumber` GET parameter in `stat.php` is not properly validated or casted to an integer, allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript and HTML code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of input validation on the `lastnumber` parameter.",
       "Exposure of configuration file (`stat.cfg`) through direct access.",
      "Exposure of log database due to predictable path based on config.",
      "Application-level Denial of Service (DoS) by providing a large integer for the `lastnumber` parameter, causing script to hit the PHP time limit.",
      "XSS vulnerability using the Referer field.",
      "Disk quota misuse due to excessive log entries with large Referer field"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code, which can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, and phishing. The attacker could also cause a denial of service by providing large integer values. The attacker could also cause disk exhaustion by providing large referer fields.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to `stat.php` with a malicious `lastnumber` parameter.",
      "Direct GET request to access the configuration file (`stat/stat.cfg`).",
      "HTTP GET request to `pixel.php` with a malicious Referer header."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
