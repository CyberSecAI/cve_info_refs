 ### Analysis of Content Related to CVE-2005-4838
 

 #### Content from bugzilla.redhat.com_a1d64bda_20250126_114512.html
 

 *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The JSPs within the Tomcat Manager application and JSP examples do not sanitize user-provided data before displaying it in the returned page.
 *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
 *  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which will be executed by the user's browser, allowing the attacker to potentially steal cookies, manipulate the page content, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.
 *   **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious scripts through user-controlled input fields in the vulnerable JSPs of the Tomcat Manager application.
 *  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable JSPs. The attacker also needs to be able to inject malicious script in user controllable input fields.
 

 #### Content from www.oliverkarow.de_2acb609e_20250125_202743.html
 

 *   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not sanitize user-provided input.
 *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross Site Scripting.
 *   **Impact of exploitation**: The attacker can execute malicious code on a victim's browser.
 *   **Attack vectors**: HTTP GET requests with injected javascript in the URL, specifically via the path parameter to the manager application. Also, by sending a crafted request to the snoop.jsp via Telnet.
 *   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. For the manager interface, the attacker needs to authenticate to access the /manager/html path.
 

 #### Content from tomcat.apache.org_e3d2cec4_20250125_202743.html
 *   **Root cause of vulnerability**: JSPs in the JSP examples and Tomcat Manager do not properly escape user-provided data before including it in the returned page.
 *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
 *   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed within the user's browser, potentially leading to cookie theft, page manipulation, or user redirection.
 *   **Attack vectors**: Crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable JSPs with user-controlled data.
 *   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send requests to the vulnerable JSPs. Authentication might be required if targeting the manager application.

 ### Summary of Findings
 

 *   The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in various JSPs within the Tomcat Manager and JSP examples.
 *   The root cause is the failure to sanitize or escape user-provided data before rendering it in the web page.
 *   Attackers can exploit this by injecting malicious scripts through user-controllable input fields in the vulnerable JSPs.
 *  Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts within the user's browser, potentially leading to cookie theft, page manipulation, and user redirection.
 *  The attacker needs to have access to the vulnerable JSPs. For the manager application, the attacker needs to be authenticated.
 *   The vulnerability affects Tomcat versions 5.5.x and 4.x.
 *   Patches for the vulnerability were provided by the Tomcat project.
