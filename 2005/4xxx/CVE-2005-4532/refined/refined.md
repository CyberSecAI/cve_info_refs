      "root_cause": "The scponlyc command allows users to chroot into arbitrary directories. Additionally, scponly does not sufficiently validate command-line parameters passed to scp or rsync commands.",

        "Insufficient command-line parameter validation",
         "Insecure chroot implementation"

      "impact": "Local users can gain root privileges by using scponlyc to chroot into arbitrary directories containing hardlinks to setuid programs. Remote users can bypass shell restrictions and execute arbitrary programs by providing malicious parameters to scp or rsync.",

        "Local exploitation via scponlyc.",

      "root_cause": "A design error in scponly allows for execution of arbitrary commands as root. The vulnerability is present when the scponlyc program is installed with setuid root permissions and regular users have shell access.",
