Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-4655:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper filtering of meta tags within the news system of PHP-Fusion 6.0.204.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The primary weakness is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the news posting functionality. Specifically, the system does not properly handle or filter meta tags included in user posts. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML content.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to redirect users to a malicious website by injecting a meta refresh tag into a news post. This can be used for phishing attacks or to spread malware. The impact of exploitation is rated as low, with a CVSS base score of 4.3/10, although it has a high exploitability score of 8.6/10 due to the remote nature of the attack and the lack of authentication requirements. Specifically, confidentiality and availability are not impacted, but there is a partial impact on integrity.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is remote. An attacker can craft a malicious meta refresh tag and include it in a news post through the website's interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to have the ability to post news articles, or manipulate a way to add meta tags within the news system. No authentication is required to perform the attack.
