How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Multiple vulnerabilities in Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version 1 implementations

#### Vulnerability Note VU#226364

Original Release Date: 2005-11-17 | Last Revised: 2006-01-03

---

### Overview

Numerous vulnerabilities have been reported in various Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementations. The impacts of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, or cause an IKEv1 implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner.

### Description

| The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Center (NISCC) and CERT-FI have reported numerous vulnerabilities in IKEv1 implementations. The IKE protocol ([RFC 2409](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2409.txt)) operates within the framework of the Internet Security Association (SA) and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP, [RFC 2408](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2408.txt)) and provides a way for nodes to authenticate each other and exchange keying material that is used to establish secure network services. IKE is commonly used by IPSec-based VPNs. The IKE negotiation process consists of two phases. Phase 1 establishes an ISAKMP SA. Phase 2 is used to create SAs for other security protocols.  These vulnerabilities were discovered using the [PROTOS Test Tool](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c09/isakmp/) developed by [Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG)](http://www.codenomicon.com/). The results of the tests are described in [NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 273756/NISCC/ISAKMP](http://www.niscc.gov.uk/niscc/docs/re-20051114-01014.pdf?lang=en). According to that advisory, many IKEv1 implementations contain buffer overflow, format string, and other unspecified vulnerabilities in phase 1 of IKEv1. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to compromise a system's security. |
| --- |

### Impact

| These vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, gain access to sensitive information, or cause an IKEv1 implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner. In addition, many of these vulnerabilities may be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted packet to a vulnerable IKEv1 installation. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from an affected product vendor |

From <http://www.openswan.org/niscc2/>

| **Executive Summary: Openswan-2 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack as reported by NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 273756/NISCC/ISAKMP** |
| --- |

 **Nov 14th, 2005**

| Vendor response of the Openswan project to the following advisory: [NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 273756/NISCC/ISAKMP](http://www.niscc.gov.uk/niscc/docs/br-20051114-01013.html)  [CVE number](http://www.cve.mitre.org/): Unknown. Not requested or disclosed by reporter  Since we did not have prior knowledge of this vulnerability, and have not been given access to the test kit, so far we have only been able to partially analyse our IPsec implementation.  **Versions of openswan-1 are (apparently) not vulnerable to this attack.**  **Versions of openswan-2 are (apparently) vulnerable to a Denial Of Service attack in two known cases.**  One involves a crafted packet using 3DES with an invalid key length. One other is still unknown to us because no more information was provided. These two cases cannot be used to obtain elevated priviledges, since it is not possible to use these bugs to execute arbitrary code. These attacks are caught within our "assertion fail" verification code.  Today we have released [openswan-2.4.2](http://www.openswan.org/download/). This release fixes the 3DES related Denial Of Service attack.  We **STRONGLY** encourage CERT-FI and/or NISCC to give us access to the test kit if they are concerned about the second vulnerability and the impact of this advisory on the wide install base of Openswan-2 if those systems are left vulnerable to a DOS attack.  Openswan is the defacto IPsec software used on many Linux distributions, such as RedHat Linux, Fedora Linux, Debian, SuSe / Novell, Mandrake and many systems including embedded devices.  For further information, please see:<http://www.openswan.org/>  [NISCC](http://www.niscc.gov.uk/niscc/docs/br-20051114-01013.html) 273756/NISCC/ISAKMP  Contact us at: security@xelerance.com  The Openswan teamXelerance Corp. |
