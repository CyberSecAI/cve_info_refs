```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
  - Off-by-one error in `sql_error` function within the `rlm_sql_unixodbc` module when handling database errors. The error message string is not properly null-terminated, potentially leading to a one-byte overflow.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Off-by-one write leading to memory corruption
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Denial of service (crashing the FreeRADIUS server).
  - Potentially arbitrary code execution, but is unlikely because the overflow is only one byte and there is a high likelihood that the memory will be aligned to 32 or 64 bits with the "extra" bytes after the request area being zero.
- Attack vectors:
  - Remote attackers can trigger the vulnerability by causing database query failures. This is only exploitable if the attacker can control the external SQL database.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Ability to cause a database query to fail via a malformed query.
  - Control of the external database or be able to manipulate it.
