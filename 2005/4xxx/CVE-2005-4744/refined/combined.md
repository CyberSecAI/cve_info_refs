This statement misrepresents our position, which we have previously
articulated to Suse:
(1) We are prepared to coordinate a public statement about the
issues raised by Suse.
(2) We have analyzed the issues raised by Suse, and we believe that
the issues are minor, and not externally exploitable.
(3) We believe a coordinated release is not necessary for minor bug
fixes that have little or no customer impact.
Saying we don't "want" to negotiate a coordinated release date is
inappropriate, and contradicts our previous statements to Suse.
As background, Suse informed us privately of the issues, and asked
us to coordinate a release date. We examined the issues they raised,
and determined that they did not have the severity claimed by Suse.
We then decided that a coordinated release date was not necessary, and
informed Suse of this.
Further, we had substantial technical concerns with the report (66%
false positive rate, among others), which we raised with Suse. To
this date, Suse has not responded in any way to our concerns.
We are disappointed that Suse has felt it necessary to misrepresent
our position in a vendor forum.
If anyone is interested in our full response to Suse's report,
please email me privately at
Alan DeKok.

Package        : freeradius
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-4744 CVE-2006-1354
BugTraq IDs    : 17171 17293
Debian Bug     : 359042

Several problems have been discovered in freeradius, a
high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2005-4744

    SuSE researchers have discovered several off-by-one errors may
    allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-1354

    Due to insufficient input validation it is possible for a remote
    attacker to bypass authentication or cause a denial of service.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain this package.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-4sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your freeradius package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=167676#c0)  Josh Bressers    2005-09-06 21:25:00 UTC  ``` A number of issues have been found in freeradius:  <http://www.freeradius.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/radiusd/src/lib/token.c.diff?r1=1.17&r2=1.18> <http://www.freeradius.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/radiusd/src/modules/rlm_sql/drivers/rlm_sql_unixodbc/sql_unixodbc.c.diff?r1=1.13&r2=1.14> * moderate Off by one error (\0 being written to end of string, probably not even a crash)  <http://www.freeradius.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/radiusd/src/main/session.c.diff?r1=1.27&r2=1.28> <http://www.freeradius.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/radiusd/src/modules/rlm_exec/exec.c.diff?r1=1.2&r2=1.3> * low Use per-system max fd to close, rather than hard-coded number  <http://www.freeradius.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/radiusd/src/main/xlat.c.diff?r1=1.101&r2=1.102> * low If strftime(3) returns 0, the contents of the string array is undefined, therefore it should not be copied.  This could lead to the leaking of 40 bytes off the stack (random unitialized memory).  <http://www.freeradius.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/radiusd/src/main/xlat.c.diff?r1=1.72.2.6&r2=1.72.2.7> * moderate/low Adds boundly length checks, whithout which it could be possible to overflow a var on the stack. * As best as I can tell, this is coming from the server, not a malicious source.  <http://www.freeradius.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/radiusd/src/modules/rlm_exec/exec.c.diff?r1=1.1&r2=1.2> * moderate Adds a boundry length check.  Possible stack buffer overflow. This sould be a crash only.  <http://www.freeradius.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/radiusd/src/modules/rlm_ldap/rlm_ldap.c.diff?r1=1.153&r2=1.154> <http://www.freeradius.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/radiusd/src/modules/rlm_ldap/rlm_ldap.c.diff?r1=1.122.2.6&r2=1.122.2.7> * moderate Properly escape ldap data.  This could possible leak ldap data via a malformed query, without proper acls.  <http://www.freeradius.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/radiusd/src/modules/rlm_sql/drivers/rlm_sql_unixodbc/sql_unixodbc.c.diff?r1=1.11.2.1&r2=1.11.2.2> * low/bug Make things a bit more thread safe by introducing a horrible horrible hack.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=167676#c1)  Josh Bressers    2005-09-06 21:29:55 UTC  ``` These issues may also affect RHEL3.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=167676#c3)  Josh Bressers    2005-09-07 12:53:30 UTC  ``` These issues should be considered public   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=167676#c4)  Josh Bressers    2005-09-12 12:19:10 UTC  ``` After reading upstream's response to these issues, I'm marking the severity as low.  Given I'm not an expert with the FreeRADIUS source, I purposely marked some of these issues as "moderate" severity to prevent us from not giving enough attention to something that may have needed it.  <http://www.freeradius.org/security/20050909-response-to-suse.txt>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=167676#c6)  Josh Bressers    2006-03-28 14:58:36 UTC  ``` After a short discussion with MITRE and some analysis, only the off my one error in sql_unixodbc.c is being considered a security issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=167676#c9)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-04-04 08:45:46 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0271.html>    ``` |  |

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Response to Suse Audit Report on FreeRADIUS.
1. Introduction
The version audited was 1.0.2.5-5. Version 1.0.4 has been out for
almost two months now, and would have been a better choice for
auditing.
3. Methodology
It would be useful to contribute the "fuzzer" back to FreeRADIUS, so
that the code could be tested automatically before any new release.
5.1 rlm\_ldap.c
\* The escaping of additional characters in ldap\_escape\_func() is a
valid consideration, and will be fixed. However, the impact of
this vulnerability is extemely small. Unlike SQL, the use of LDAP
in the server is read-only. As a result, any "exploit" of this
vulnerability means that the attacker can add additional
constraints to an LDAP search. The likely result is that the
information needed by the server will not be found, and the request
will be rejected.
\* an unavailable LDAP server will not block the daemon. See
multiple references to "timeout" in rlm\_ldap.c
5.3 rlm\_sql.c
\* The upper limit for the input conversion is set by the caller of
sql\_escape\_func(). It is the callers responsibility to ensure that
the output buffer is large enough to contain all possible inputs.
The code, and queries have already been audited to ensure that
there is no exploit vector.
And there is no "Auth-Type := SQL" in the server. A cursory
examination of the source code would reveal this information.
The attack vector (User-Name "johndoedorian" being truncated to
"johndoe") postulated in this section is, in fact, impossible to
exploit through the SQL module. The queries used to obtain
passwords take only the user name from the RADIUS packet as input.
That user name can be a maximum of 253 characters long. The buffer
used to create the query is 4k bytes, which is more than sufficient
to hold any possible user name value, even if it consisted solely
of characters that would be escaped.
\* The sql\_set\_user function doesn't do escaping, and is designed to
not do escaping. If it did escaping, then there would be multiple
layers of escaping, which would be a bug. See the comments in the
cvs commit of revision 1.134 of rlm\_sql.c
5.4 sql\_unixodbc.c
\* The one-byte overflow in sql\_error, lines 362-363 is a valid
consideration, and will be fixed. However, the nature of the
memory allocation means that there is a high likelihood that the
size of the memory will be aligned to 32 or 64 bits, and that the
"extra" bytes after the request area will be zero. This
side-effect will minimize the impact of the vulnerability.
Further, the vulnerability is limited to situations where the
query to the external database fails. Unless the external
database is under control of an attacker, this vulnerability is
not exploitable. If the external database is under control of an
attacker, then there are very many other, and worse, things that
they can do.
A cursory examination of the callers code path indicates that the
only use of this data is by the "radlog" (i.e. snprintf) function.
The most likely side-effect of this vulnerability is that the
server walks off the end of allocated memory, and SEGV's.
Finally, a futher examination of the callers code path indicates
that there is another bug, not previously known. The "sql\_error"
function should \*not\* allocate memory, as none of the callers
"free" the string returned by sql\_error.
This bug will be fixed before the next release of the server.
5.7 rlm\_realm.c
\* There is no need to add a trailing zero to vp->strvalue in
check\_for\_realm(), line 209. All strings in VALUE\_PAIR's are NUL
terminated. The code does not have to add a trailing NUL because
the source is a VALUE\_PAIR, which is guaranteed to have a trailing
NUL, and the destination is a VALUE\_PAIR, which is guaranteed to
have enough room to store the source data.
\* There is no need to add a trailing zero to vp->strvalue in
check\_for\_realm(), line 210. See the preceding comment for
details.
5.9 session.c
\* The max FD in rad\_check\_ts(), line 202 is a valid consideration,
but the suggestion of adding Linux-specific code (OPEN\_MAX\_LINUX)
to the server means that it is guaranteed to not build on other
platforms. FreeRADIUS is a cross-platform product, and will
continue to be a cross-platform product. Also, OPEN\_MAX\_LINUX is
not available on 2.4 kernels.
This issue is mitigated by the fact that the program being
executed is "checkrad", which is part of the server core. If an
attacker can access open FD's in checkrad, they can write to any
program on the system, in which case there are very many other,
and worse, things that they can do.
\* The strings used as command-line options in radius\_exec\_program()
line 224 do not need to be sanitized for command-line options.
The only command-line option that checkrad takes is "-d", which is
required to be the first parameter. That first parameter is taken
from the local configuration file (nastype), and cannot be added
by an attacker. The only way to exploit this issue is if an
attacker can write to the server configuration files, in which
case there are very many other, and worse, things that they can
do.
5.11 log.c
\* Integer wrapping in vradlog(), line 133 is impossible, unless
ctime\_r returns more than 8k of data. Since ctime\_r always
returns less than 256 bytes, the buffer overflow and "exploit" is
non-existent.
\* Checking the buffer bounds in vradlog(), line 135 is a valid
consideration, and will be addressed. However, the only way to
access this function is by through code internal to the server,
and none of the server log messages contain sufficient user data
to fill the 8k buffer. So while potentially an exploit, there is
currently no code path in the server by which this buffer can be
over-run.
\* The strcat in vradlog(), line 150 may overflow the buffer in
theory, but a close examination of the code shows that the
preceding comment applies here, too.
5.12 auth.c
\* There is no need to add a trailing zero in rad\_auth\_log(), lines
131, 143, and 145. These comments are based on a misunderstanding
of the server internals. See the comments above for section 5.7.
\* Yes, in rad\_authenticate() line 678, auth\_item->strvalue is
guaranteed to have a trailing zero. See the comments above for
Section 5.7.
5.13 radius.c
\* rad\_decode() Yes, we know that the Vendor-Specific attribute
allows for sub-attributes. The Vendor-Specific attribute MAY also
contain non-RFC vendor attributes, or plain text (if the vendor
does not follow the RFC's). The code in rad\_decode() was written
to specifically handle these situations, and to deal with it
gracefully.
Further, the line you've flagged as "AUD: not even checked by
rad\_recv" (attrlen = \*ptr++) is, in fact, checked by the code few
lines above (via subptr and sublen), which you've quoted on page 5
of the report.. It is apparent that you did not read the code you
quoted, or the comments describing how it works, and what it does.
Your comment that "rad\_decode() actually interprets the
(unchecked) content of the VSA" is simply not true. It should be
obvious that it's not true through two pieces of information:
1) the code you quoted on page 5 does, in fact, check the data
2) You indicated that you were unable to trigger the bug using
your Fuzzer.
As for the "else chunk of the last if() condition", it is unclear
what code you're referring to.
We suggest reading the code in more detail, and observing the
servers response when you send it malformed VSA's. You will see
that it collects the data, and places it into a Vendor-Specific
attribute of type "octets". This attribute will then hold any
data in any format, including non-VSA formats.
There is no potential for overflow, as indicated on page 6 of the
report. Further, the comment that the "overflow can probably be
triggered without knowing any secret" is not entirely correct.
The secret is used to validate the packet a few lines above the
code you quoted in rad\_decode(). For response packets, and for
Access-Request packets containing a Message-Authenticator
attribute, the code you indicate as "potential overflow" will not
be reached. Instead, the packet will be silently discarded as
failing validation.
For Access-Request packets that do not contain a
Message-Authenticator attribute, the "potential overflow" will not
occur, because as indicated above, the data from the packet is
validated before being used.
\* The "overflow" you indicate in rad\_pwdecode() does not exist in
the code. See src/include/radiusd.h. The maximum possible length
for secrets is 32 characters. This buffer is more than large
enough for any possible secret that can be read from a
configuration file. Even if it was exploitable, the server would
only be vulnerable to an attacker who could write to the server
configuration files. In that case, there are very many other, and
worse, things that they can do.
\* The "overflow" you indicate in rad\_tunnel\_pwencode() has the same
response as the preceding comment.
5.14 xlat.c
\* Bounds checking in decode\_attribute. This is a bug, and will be
fixed. However, it is an exploint only for attackers who have
access to the server configuration files. In that case, there are
very many other, and worse, things that they can do.
\* radius\_xlat, line 725. We have no idea why this comment is
relevant. The problem of "SQL characters in DNS hostnames" is,
quite simply, irrelevant.
For outputs which are not used by the SQL module, escaping DNS
data is the wrong thing to do. For outputs which are used by the
SQL module, the "sql\_escape\_func" is used, which you refer to
earlier in your analysis. So there is no vulnerability.
And if this statement was true, there are many, many, other places
in the code where DNS names are used by the server, and those
should have been caught by the audit, too.
5.15 exec.c
\* The closing of file descriptors could be done better. See
also the comments above in section 5.9.
In addition, the program being executed is under control of the
local administrator. If an attacker can access open FD's in the
executed program, they can write to any program on the system, in
which case there are very many other, and worse, things that they
can do.
\* radius\_exec\_program(), lines 117-233. Escaping of strings for "\_"
or "-" will not be done in the server, for the simple reason that
any escaping will be wrong. A little time spent thinking about
possible solutions and side-effects should lead you to the same
conclusion.
e.g. "foo-bar" is a valid Unix command. Escaping the "-" is wrong.
It is the responsibility of the administrator to ensure that the
configuration he creates is not vulnerable to issues such as this.
All the server can do is to not create more issues itself, as your
solution would do.
\* Checking for MAX\_ENVP is a valid consideration, and will be fixed.
It is mitigated by the "security" section of the server, where the
server will not accept more than 200 attributes, and MAX\_ENVP is
set here to 1024.
6. Summary.
The summary paragraph is wrong. The comment that "FreeRADIUS tries
hardly to enforce the rules of the RADIUS RFC" is condescending, and
is designed to inflame. The comments in the source code that you
quoted in the report indicates \*why\* the server processes "malformated
packages". (Perhaps you mean "malformed attributes"?)
The purpose behind accepting attributes that do not follow the RFC
recommendations is vendor interoperability. This purpose is clearly
described in the code, so we're not sure how it was missed.
See also the comments above for section 5.13. Making
recommendations based on misunderstandings and/or misreading of the
source code is inappropriate. We suggest that future audit reports do
not contain recommendations such as these.
There are some valid points in the document. Others, however, show
a lack of understanding of RADIUS, and a failure to adequately read
the code being audited.
7. The RADIUS Fuzzer
It would be good to make the code public.
8. Status
The "decoding functions in radius.c need more attention" by Suse,
not by FreeRADIUS. The code has been audited multiple times, and
there are no known issues. Further, the issues raised by Suse about
that code indicate that THE CODE WAS NOT READ. The data flagged as
"unchecked" is, in fact, checked by the code a few lines above it,
which are quoted in the report (see 5.13, above).
This statement indicates severe flaws with the analysis methods used
to generate the report.
Our Response
------------
By our analysis, the issues Suse raises may be grouped into the
following categories:
(a) low-impact, non-exploitable externally accessible issues
5.1 (1) ldap escaping
(b) low-impact non-exploitable, non-externally accessible issues.
5.4 sql\_unixodbc memory allocation error
(c) issues exploitable by the RADIUS server administrator
5.9 (1) max\_fd
5.11 (2) vradlog, line 135
5.11 (3) vradlog, line 150
5.15 (1) max\_fd
5.15 (3) MAX\_ENVP not checked
(d) Misunderstandings or misreading of the source:
5.1 (2) unavailable LDAP blocking the server
5.3 (1) sql\_escape\_func
5.3 (2) rlm\_sql\_authorize, line 747
5.7 (1) check\_for\_realm, line 209
5.7 (2) check\_for\_realm, line 210
5.9 (2) arguments to checkrad
5.11 (1) vradlog, line 133
5.12 (1) rad\_auth\_log
5.12 (2) rad\_authenticate line 678
5.13 (2) rad\_decode()
5.13 (3) rad\_pwdecode()
5.13 (4) rad\_tunnel\_pwdecode()
5.14 (2) DNS escaping for SQL
5.15 (2) escaping command-line options
Out of 21 reported issues, 14 are not real. A false-positive rate
of 67% is indicates serious issues with the analysis methods.
The issues listed under (d), above are not appropriate for public
release. We suggest you delete them from any vulnerability list you
have compiled for FreeRADIUS.
The other issues will be addressed in 1.0.5, which we were already
planning to release this week. Our analysis indicates that an
attacker can not use knowledge of these issues to successfully
propogate any attack which would result in server compromise, or DoS
of the server. As a result, there is no need to keep knowledge of
these issues a secret, and we have decided to fix them in CVS.
Our Response to later comments by Suse and RedHat
-------------------------------------------------
We have concerns with a message Suse sent to the vendor-sec mailing
list. Our response is here:
http://www.freeradius.org/security/suse-vendor-sec.txt
Shortly after our response, RedHat posted a message on Bugtraq,
which led to the following vulnerability listing on Security Focus:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/14775
The comments under "discuss" say:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/14775/discuss
The first issues are memory handling vulnerabilities. These
issues may allow remote attackers to crash affected services,
or possibly execute arbitrary machine code in the context of
the vulnerable application.
FreeRADIUS is also affected by a possible file descriptor
leak. This may be exploited to gain access to files that an attacker
may not normally have access to.
Based on our analysis, both of these comments are, quite simply,
false. For the issues found by Suse, there is no possible external
exploit vector that crashes the system or allows execution of
arbitrary machine code.
If Suse or RedHat knows of such exploits, it is imperative that they
inform the FreeRADIUS team as soon as possible, using the contact
address , as indicated on the FreeRADIUS web
site. At this time, no such contact has been received.
The second comment, that an attacker can use a file descriptor leak
"to gain access to files that an attacker may not normally have access
to" is again not true. The analysis above in Sections 5.9 and 5.15
explain why this "exploit" is nonsense.
RedHat also posted the following bug report on their web site:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show\_bug.cgi?id=167676
It appears that RedHat did not perform any additional analysis of
the project, in order to make an independent determination of any
vulnerabilities in FreeRADIUS. This determination is apparent from
the fact that other issues discovered by Primoz Bratanic are listed in
"doc/ChangeLog", but are not found in RedHat's bug report, or on the
Security Focus page.
We curious as to Suse's response to our analysis. An earlier
version of this response to Suse's report was sent to Suse, and they
have not, as yet, responded to the criticisms raised here-in. We
believe that Suse should address it's analysis methods, but we have no
reason to expect that will happen.
In summary, we have released version 1.0.5 of the server in order to
address the issues raised by Suse, by Primoz Bratanic, and from
internal analysis. We are willing to communicate with anyone about
vulnerabilities in the server (potential or otherwise). We welcome
the chance to educate security analysts about the design of the
server, and about how apparent vulnerabilities may, in fact, be
non-exploitable.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

freeradius security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0271)

## Topic

Updated freeradius packages that fix an authentication weakness are now
available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly configurable free RADIUS server
designed to allow centralized authentication and authorization for a network.

A bug was found in the way FreeRADIUS authenticates users via the MSCHAP V2
protocol. It is possible for a remote attacker to authenticate as a victim
by sending a malformed MSCHAP V2 login request to the FreeRADIUS server.
(CVE-2006-1354)

Please note that FreeRADIUS installations not using the MSCHAP V2 protocol
for authentication are not vulnerable to this issue.

A bug was also found in the way FreeRADIUS logs SQL errors from the
sql\_unixodbc module. It may be possible for an attacker to cause FreeRADIUS
to crash or execute arbitrary code if they are able to manipulate the SQL
database FreeRADIUS is connecting to. (CVE-2005-4744)

Users of FreeRADIUS should update to these erratum packages, which contain
backported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
