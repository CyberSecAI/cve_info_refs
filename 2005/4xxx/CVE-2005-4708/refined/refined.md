{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improperly configured access controls in Microsoft Windows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure configurations within user accounts and groups allow local users to access and manipulate system resources. Specifically, the vulnerabilities lie in weak permissions on Windows services, files and directories, and registry keys.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local user with valid login credentials may gain elevated privileges on the vulnerable Windows system. Publicly available exploit code exists that can identify vulnerable services, potentially allowing a remote attacker to gain access.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access; a user with valid login credentials can exploit the misconfigured permissions. Remote exploitation is possible if the attacker can run the exploit code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local user with valid login credentials is required for local privilege escalation. For remote exploitation, the attacker needs the ability to execute an exploit on the vulnerable system."
