How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle WebLogic Server

Oracle WebLogic Server is a unified and extensible platform for developing, deploying, and running enterprise applications in Java for on-premises and in the cloud. WebLogic Server offers a robust, mature, and scalable implementation of Jakarta EE.

**WebLogic Server on Kubernetes**

Oracle WebLogic Server is fully supported on Kubernetes and enables users to migrate and efficiently build modern container apps with comprehensive Java services. Check out the WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit, a complete set of open source tools that simplifies running on Kubernetes, on-premises, or in the cloud.

[Learn about the ToolKit](//blogs.oracle.com/weblogicserver/weblogic-kubernetes-toolkit-update-operator-3)

**Run WebLogic applications in the cloud**

With rapid provisioning and choice of infrastructure and pricing, Oracle WebLogic Server for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides full support to run Jakarta EE applications in the cloud.

[Learn about the features](//blogs.oracle.com/weblogicserver/announcing-oracle-weblogic-server-for-oracle-cloud-infrastructure)

### Why build with Oracle WebLogic Server?

#### Full Jakarta EE implementation

Jakarta EE provides a powerful combination of technologies and APIs that focus on ease of enterprise application development and management.
