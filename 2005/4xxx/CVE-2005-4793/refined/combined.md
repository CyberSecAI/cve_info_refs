(*2) Upgrade this version.

Note that products that operate while linked to NNM might also have to be
upgraded. For the appropriate version of such linked products, refer to the
applicable documentation for that product (such as readme files or
documentation provided with the software).

(*3) NNM 07-10-02 or 07-10-03 is a prerequisite for the fixed version

(accumulative patch) NNM 07-10-04. If your system uses NNM 07-10 or
07-10-01, an overwrite installation must be performed for NNM 07-10-02
before applying NNM 07-10-04.
Alternatively, if your system uses NNM 07-10-02 or 07-10-03 and
workaround #2 (below) has been carried out, restore the CGI programs to
their original directories before applying NNM 07-10-04.

(*4) For detailed information about this model, contact your Hitachi support

service representative.

For the fixed versions and older versions not mentioned in the above table,
contact your Hitachi support service representative.

[Workarounds]
Until the fixed versions are released, carry out both of the workarounds indicated
below.

Workaround #1: (Workaround for vulnerability #1 and #3)
Set filtering for the firewall or router so that the TCP port that the web server for
the web utility function of NNM uses can only communicate with reliable
parties.

Workaround #2: (Workaround for vulnerability #2)
When the following version number of NNM matches your system, move the
corresponding CGI programs that NNM supplies to any other new directory.

connectedNodes.ovpl (In the case of NNM 06-51 or later)
cdpView.ovpl (In the case of NNM 06-51 or later)
freeIPaddrs.ovpl (In the case of NNM 06-51 or later)
ecscmg.ovpl (*4) (In the case of NNM 05-20 or later)

(*4) This CGI program is being examined to determine whether it is vulnerable.

The above CGI programs are placed in the following path.

Windows
 <installation-folder-for-NNM>\www\cgi-bin
UNIX
 /opt/OV/www/cgi-bin

Performing the workarounds and moving the CGI programs affects NNM
functions as follows.

connectedNodes.ovpl
 The GUI menu for "Port/Address Mapping" becomes disabled.
cdpView.ovpl
 The CDP view becomes disabled.
freeIPaddrs.ovpl
 The GUI menu for "IP addresses not in use" becomes disabled.
ecscmg.ovpl
 The configuration for actions triggered by events becomes disabled.
