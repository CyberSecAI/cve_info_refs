# VMware Workstation: Vulnerability in NAT networking — GLSA **200601-04**

VMware guest operating systems can execute arbitrary code with elevated
privileges on the host operating system through a flaw in NAT networking.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.5.1.19175** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.5.1.19175**revision >= **4.5.3.19414**revision >= **3.2.1.2242-r10** |

### Background

VMware Workstation is a powerful virtual machine for developers and
system administrators.

### Description

Tim Shelton discovered that vmnet-natd, the host module providing
NAT-style networking for VMware guest operating systems, is unable to
process incorrect 'EPRT' and 'PORT' FTP requests.

### Impact

Malicious guest operating systems using the NAT networking feature or
local VMware Workstation users could exploit this vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code on the host system with elevated privileges.

### Workaround

Disable the NAT service by following the instructions at http://www.vmware.com/support/k
b, Answer ID 2002.

### Resolution

All VMware Workstation users should upgrade to a fixed version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose app-emulation/vmware-workstation
```

## VMware NAT Service vulnerable to buffer overflow via FTP PORT/EPRT commands

#### Vulnerability Note VU#856689

Original Release Date: 2005-12-21 | Last Revised: 2005-12-24

---

### Overview

The VMware NAT Service used in multiple VMware products contains a buffer overflow in the way it handles FTP PORT and EPRT commands. An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the NAT service or cause a denial of service.

### Description

| VMware virtualization software provides Network Address Translation ([NAT](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1631.txt)) for guest systems to access networks. The VMware NAT Service does not adequately validate parameters to the PORT and EPRT commands. As a result, specially crafted PORT or EPRT commands can trigger a buffer overflow. VMware Workstation, GSX Server, ACE, and Player products for Windows, Linux, and Solaris host platforms are affected. Additional information is available in VMware Knowledge Base Answer ID [2000](http://www.vmware.com/support/kb/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2000).  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a user to run code provided by the attacker on a VMware guest/virtual system. The attacker could then cross the boundary of the guest system and run arbitrary code within the context of the NAT process on the VMware host system. This attack vector may be of particular concern to users who intentionally run untrusted code in VMware environments. An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability remotely if the VMware NAT Service is configured to forward connections to guest/virtual systems. By default, the VMware NAT Service is not configured to forward connections, and in either scenario it may be necessary for the attacker to connect to an FTP server in order to issue crafted PORT or EPRT commands. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the VMware NAT Service (Local System on Windows platforms, root on Linux platforms) or cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This vulnerability is addressed in:     + VMware Workstation 5.5.1 + VMware GSX Server 3.2.1 + VMware ACE 1.0.2 + VMware Player 1.0.1  The latest releases of these products are available from the [VMware Download Center](http://www.vmware.com/download/). |
| --- |

| **Disable VMware NAT Service**Disable the VMware NAT Service as described in VMware Knowledge Base Answer ID [2002](http://www.vmware.com/support/kb/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2002). |
