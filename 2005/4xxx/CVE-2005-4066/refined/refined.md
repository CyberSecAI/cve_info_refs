**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the way Total Commander encrypts FTP account information in the `WCX_FTP.INI` file. The encryption is not robust, allowing an attacker to potentially recover the stored FTP credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak encryption of FTP account information.
- Storing potentially sensitive credentials in a file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of FTP credentials, allowing unauthorized access to FTP servers.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could gain access to the `WCX_FTP.INI` file from a compromised system or through other means.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to access the `WCX_FTP.INI` file.
- Basic knowledge of the weak encryption used.
