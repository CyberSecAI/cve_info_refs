How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Title: Cerberus Helpdesk multiple vulnerabilities.
Severity: Medium
Affected: cerberus-gui (2.649), support-center (2.649<->3.2.0pr2)
Problem type: remote
Author: Alejandro Ramos

Description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cerberus Helpdesk is a WebGroup Media helpdesk suite based in php enviroment.
Official webpage: <http://www.cerberusweb.com/>

Details:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

support-center:
*******************************
a
    SQL injection in attachment_send.php (line 112):
        You can download files from other users or use blind sql injection attacks:
        Example url:
       .../support-center/cerberus-support-center/attachment_send.php?file_id=N [SQL] \
&thread_id=1  CODE:
        $sql = "SELECT part_content FROM thread_attachments_parts WHERE file_id = \
$file_id";

    XSS:
    <http://server/support-center/index.php?mod_id=2&kb_ask=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22XSS%22%29%3C%2Fscript%3E>

cerberus-gui (parser-related):
*******************************

There are few sql injections if XML is malicious generated:

    SQL injections in email_parser.php:

    Function: "is_queue_address" (line: 1397) doesn´t check properly the "$addy" \
value.    CODE:
        $sql = sprintf("SELECT q.queue_name, q.queue_mode, \
q.queue_email_display_name, ".  "qa.queue_addresses_id, qa.queue_id, \
qa.queue_address, ".  "qa.queue_domain, q.queue_prefix, q.queue_response_open, ".

        strtolower($mailbox),
        strtolower($domain)

    Function: "is_banned_address" (line: 752) doesn´t check "$address" properly.
     CODE:
        SELECT a.address_banned FROM address a WHERE a.address_address = \
'".$address."'";
    Function: "is_admin_address" (line 1532) you can bypass this function using, as \
an email address, the following query: "'OR'u.user_superuser'='1'--".  Example of \
                result of this query:
        SELECT u.user_id FROM user u WHERE u.user_email != '' AND u.user_email = '' \
OR u.user_superuser = '1'  CODE:
        SELECT u.user_id FROM user u WHERE u.user_email != '' AND u.user_email = \
'$address'";

    SQL injection in structs.php:
    Function: "cer_email_address_struct" (line: 167) doesn´t check the following \
query.  CODE:
        $sql = "SELECT a.address_id,a.address_banned FROM address a WHERE \
a.address_address = '" . $a_address . "'";

cerberus-gui:
*******************************

    SQL injection in cer_KnowledgebaseHandler.class.php:
    Function: "_load_article_details" (line 270), you can fetch "superuser" md5 \
