The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Cerberus Helpdesk, specifically affecting `cerberus-gui` (version 2.649) and `support-center` (versions 2.649 to 3.2.0pr2).

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection in `support-center/attachment_send.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `file_id` parameter in the URL is directly used in an SQL query without sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can download files from other users or execute blind SQL injection attacks to extract sensitive data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted URL with malicious SQL code in the `file_id` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `support-center/index.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `kb_ask` parameter in the URL is not sanitized, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
    *   **Weakness:** XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted URL with malicious JavaScript code in the `kb_ask` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server and have a user visit the malicious link.
*   **Multiple SQL Injections in `cerberus-gui/email_parser.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The functions `is_queue_address`, `is_banned_address`, and `is_admin_address` do not properly sanitize input parameters before using them in SQL queries.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can extract sensitive database information by injecting malicious SQL. In the `is_admin_address` function, attackers can bypass authentication.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted XML data processed by `email_parser.php` or specially crafted email addresses.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests containing the malicious XML or send email.
*   **SQL Injection in `cerberus-gui/structs.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `cer_email_address_struct` function doesn't sanitize the `$a_address` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can extract sensitive data via SQL injection
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted input passed to the `cer_email_address_struct` function.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected function.
*  **SQL Injection in `cerberus-gui/cer_KnowledgebaseHandler.class.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `_load_article_details` function does not properly sanitize the `kbid` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can fetch sensitive information, such as user passwords using a blind SQL injection technique.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted URL with malicious SQL code in the `kbid` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
*   **SQL Injection in `cerberus-gui/addresses_export.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The `queues` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query
    *   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can extract sensitive data through SQL injection
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with a malicous SQL code in the `queues` parameter.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
*   **SQL Injection in `cerberus-gui/display.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `$thread` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can extract sensitive data via SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a request with a malicious value for the `$thread` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
*   **SQL Injection in `cerberus-gui/display_ticket_thread.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `ticket` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can extract sensitive data via SQL injection
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a request with a malicious value for the `ticket` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.

**Proposed Solution:**
The author suggests changing every `$cerberus_db->query($sql)` to `$cerberus_db->escape($sql)` to properly sanitize the input before using it in SQL queries, preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.
