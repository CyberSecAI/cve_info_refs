## 1. Overview:

Microsoft issued a security bulletin summary for March 2006 which
contained two security advisories: MS06-011 and MS06-012. Microsoft
also
released an update for MS06-011 on June 13, 2006. The advisories

A
description of the vulnerabilities can
be found at:

* <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-mar.mspx>

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be
affected by these vulnerabilities.
## 2. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose Operating
Systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
Operating
System or applications which come with the Operating System. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
these vulnerabilities directly but the underlying Microsoft platform may
be impacted. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems, Microsoft
recommends
installing patches. Detailed instructions for patching the Operating
System are given by Microsoft at the following links:

* <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-011.mspx>
* <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-012.mspx>

The following Avaya software-only products run on Microsoft Operating
Systems
and may have been installed on a vulnerable Microsoft Operating System.
Customers should determine on which Microsoft Operating System the
product was
installed and then follow Microsoft's guidance for applying patches:

## 3. Avaya System Products

Avaya system products include an Operating System with the product
when it is
delivered. The system products described below are delivered with a
Microsoft
Operating System. Actions to be taken with these products are also
described
below.

| Product: | Affected S/W Version(s): | Recommended Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unified Communications Center (UCC) - S3400 | None | Not Affected. The Unified Communications Center product is deployed with the Microsoft Windows 2000 Operating System. |
| Modular Messaging - Messaging Application Server (MAS) | 3.0 | Follow Microsoft's recommendation for installing the Operating System patch: MS06-011MS06-012 The Modular Messaging - Messaging Application Server (MAS) is deployed with the Microsoft Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows 2003 Operating System. Only version 3 is affected by these two vulnerabilities. Avaya recommends applying the updated patch from Microsoft for MS06-011. |
| S8100/DefinityOne/IP600 Media Servers> | None | Not Affected. These products are deployed with either the Microsoft Windows 2000 Operating System or the Microsoft Windows NT Operating System. |

## 4. Recommended Actions:

Avaya recommends that the Microsoft patches and/or workaround
solutions are
applied for the vulnerability outlined in the above system product
table.
Although certain Avaya system products utilize Microsoft Operating
Systems and
may be affected by these vulnerabilities, Avaya recommends that the use
of
e-mail clients and Internet browsers be restricted on Avaya system
products
(i.e. Outlook Express and Internet Explorer). The use of browsers should
be
restricted to authorized users-only as well as limited to the
operational-needs
of the product. Unrestricted access to the Intranet or Internet should
be
prohibited beyond the necessary functions of the product's web
administration
interface and to obtaining patches. This reduces the risk of
vulnerabilities in
these applications.

Further information regarding the Microsoft patches on Avaya system
products
is below:

**MS06-011** [Permissive Windows Services DACLs Could Allow Elevation of Privilege
(914798)](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-011.mspx):
A vulnerability has been discovered in Windows XP SP1 and Windows 2003
that
could allow for an attacker which is already validated as a member of
the
Network Configuration Operators group on the targeted machine to take
complete
control of the systems. An update to this advisory has been published
as of June
13, 2006. The Avaya Modular Messaging Message Application Server V 3.0
runs on
Windows 2003, and is affected by this vulnerability. The Common
Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-0023](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2006-0023) to this issue.

**MS06-012**[Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution
(905413)](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-012.mspx):
A vulnerability has been reported in Microsoft Office Excel. An
attacker that
attacks a vulnerable system where the logged in user has administrative
rights
can take complete control of the system. Avaya system products do not
ship with
Microsoft Office Excel, and are therefore not affected by this
vulnerability.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) had
assigned the
names
[CVE-2006-0020](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4131),

Details of a zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet program have been put up for sale on eBay, with the seller offering a starting price of 1 US cent. At the time of writing, the bidding had reached $US60 ($A79).

Zero day means information that is not publicly available and is used to describe security vulnerabilities exploits which are unknown to security professionals.

The seller said the vulnerability had been discovered on December 6 and the details had been sent to Microsoft.

"All the details were submitted to Microsoft, and the reply was received indicating that they may start working on it," he wrote. "It can be assumed that no patch addressing this vulnerability will be available within the next few months.

"So, since I was unable to find any use for this by-product of Microsoft developers, it is now available for you at the low starting price of $0.01 (a fair value estimation for any Microsoft product). A percentage of this sale will be contributed to various open-source projects."

As a special offer, he said Microsoft representatives who bid would get 10 per cent off the price they offered. "To qualify, you

must provide @microsoft.com e-mail address and must mention discount code LINUXRULZ during checkout," the seller specified.

Anyone who bid for the vulnerability details had to agree not to use the information for malicious or illegal purposes. "The information you receive is for educational and research purposes only," the seller wrote.

The winning bidder will receive two Excel files, one being the original document, and the other being is a copy modified to demonstrate the vulnerability. A detailed description of the flaw will also be provided.

Online auction giant eBay shut down the bidding for a vulnerability in Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet program on Thursday, saying that the sale of flaw research violates the site's policy against encouraging illegal activity.

The vulnerability, which could allow a malicious programmer to create an Excel file that could take control of a Windows computer when opened, appears to be real. Members of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) are investigating the [vulnerability report](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/15780/info), a spokesperson for the software giant said Thursday night. eBay pulled the auction after Microsoft complained to the company's Trust and Safety Team, said Catherine England, spokeswoman for the online auctioneer.

"The listing was immediately reviewed and pulled from the site for violating our policy against promoting illegal activity - hacking," England said in an email to SecurityFocus. "In general, research can be sold as a product. However, if the research were to violate the law or intellectual property rights then it would not be allowed."

The online auction company "prohibits the sale of items or links to items that encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activity," according to its [stated policy](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/encouraging-illegal-activity.html).

The move comes as the idea of selling vulnerability research has gained more traction amongst the security industry and research communities. Buying flaw information is a controversial practice, but one [currently supported](http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11253) by at least two security companies: iDefense and 3Com's TippingPoint. Both companies have created initiatives aimed at procuring original vulnerability research from independent flaw finders.

Software makers tend to [frown upon such tactics](http://www.securityfocus.com/news/10827) because the exposure of vulnerabilities in their product can significantly undermine trust in their product and [even their stock evaluations](http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11197). Microsoft typically will criticize researchers who publicly disclose flaws before giving the company adequate time, typically at least 30 days and frequently many months, to fix the problem.

The person trying to sell the alleged flaw in Excel, identified only by his eBay nickname "fearwall," laced his [description of the flaw](http://www.osvdb.org/blog/?p=71) with barbs aimed at Microsoft.

"Since I was unable to find any use for this by-product of Microsoft developers, it is now available for you at the low starting price of $0.01 -a fair value estimation for any Microsoft product," the seller stated in the description of his auction. Attempts to contact the seller have so far been unsuccessful.

Turning to auctions to maximize a security researcher's profits and fairly value security research is also not a new idea. Two years ago, security expert Greg Hoglund had reserved the domain "zerobay.com" and intended to create an auction site, but worries over liability caused him to scuttle the plan a few days before the site went live, he said.

"I discussed the idea a lot with other people in the community," said Hoglund, who is now the CEO of reverse engineering firm HBGary. "Generally, people thought the idea would be the best way to sell that sort of material."

The problem with the current market for vulnerabilities is that security researchers are generally poorly paid for the amount of work that they have to invest in finding flaws, he said. Knowledgeable researchers, which might otherwise charge $100 or more an hour for their work, can spend weeks searching for security problems, Hoglund said.

"Companies have this expectation that this information should be provided to them for free," he said. "And that's not fair, because these people are highly skilled labor."

Microsoft will continue to analyze the flaw and will provide a patch, if necessary, the software giant's spokesperson said.

---

### Overview

Microsoft Excel contains an error in range validation, which may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly-discovered, privately reported and public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin.

On vulnerable versions of Office, if a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a file.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Office Excel Remote Code Execution Using a Malformed Record Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0031:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Excel opens a specially crafted Excel file using a malformed record, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Excel validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Administrative Installation Information

If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your computer.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

2. Click **Save this program to disk**, and then click **OK**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Using Windows Explorer, locate the folder that contains the saved file. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click OK to extract the .msp file:

   **[path\name of EXE file] /c /t:C:\AdminUpdate**

   **Note** Double-clicking the .exe file does not extract the .msp file; it applies the update to the local computer. In order to update an administrative image, you must first extract the .msp file.
5. Click **Yes** to accept the License Agreement.
6. Click **Yes** if you are prompted to create the folder.
7. If you are familiar with the procedure for updating **your** administrative installation, click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click OK:

   **msiexec /a** *Admin Path*\*\*\\*\*MSI File \*\*/p C:\adminUpdate\\*\**MSP File* **SHORTFILENAMES=TRUE**

   **Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\OfficeXp), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *MSP File* is the name of the administrative update (for example, SHAREDff.msp).

   **Note** You can append /**qb+** to the command line so that the **Administrative Installation** dialog box and the **End User License Agreement** dialog box do not appear.
8. Click **Next** in the provided dialog box. Do not change your CD key, installation location, or company name in the provided dialog box.
9. Click **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then click **Install**.

At this point, your administrative installation point is updated. Next, you must update the workstations configurations that were originally installed from this administrative installation. To do this, please review the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section. Any new installations that you run from this administrative installation point will include the update.

**Warning** Any workstation configuration that was originally installed from this administrative installation before you installed the update cannot use this administrative installation for actions like repairing Office or adding new features until you complete the steps in the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section for this workstation.

**Workstation Deployment Information**

To deploy the update to the client workstations, click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click OK:

**msiexec /I** *Admin Path*\*\*\\*\*MSI File \*\*/qb REINSTALL=\*\*Feature List **REINSTALLMODE=vomu**

**Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\OfficeXP), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *Feature List* is the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update.

To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL** or you can install the following features.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
