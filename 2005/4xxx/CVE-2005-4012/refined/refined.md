Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary root cause is the insufficient input validation of the `lastnumber` GET variable in the `stat.php` script. This allows for the injection of arbitrary code and other attacks.
*   **Exposed Configuration File:** The configuration file (`stat.cfg`) is directly accessible through a GET request, revealing sensitive information.
*   **Unprotected Log Database:** The log database location is exposed, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Unrestricted Referer Field Storage:** The script stores the referrer field without proper sanitization, enabling XSS attacks.
*  **Lack of Log Rotation**: The application does not rotate the database, which can be misused to fill the remote disk with multiple crafted queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The `lastnumber` parameter in `stat.php` is vulnerable to javascript/html injection because it's not properly sanitized.
    *   The referrer field can also be used for XSS attacks since it is stored unsanitized in the database and later displayed in the backend.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   The configuration file (`stat.cfg`) is accessible, revealing the log directory.
    *   The log database file is exposed through the log directory location.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   A large integer value for `lastnumber` can cause the script to exceed the PHP execution time limit, resulting in a DoS.
*   **Disk Quota Misuse:** Sending requests with a large referer field can be used to fill up the server's disk space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts to steal user cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the web application.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive configuration information and log data.
*   **DoS:** The application can be made unavailable by exhausting resources.
*  **Disk Quota Misuse:** Attackers can misuse the remote disk quota by repeatedly sending request with a large referrer field.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerabilities are mainly exploited through crafted HTTP GET requests to `stat.php`, `stat.cfg`, and `pixel.php`.
    * `stat.php?lastnumber=<malicious_code>`
    * `/stat/stat.cfg`
    * `curl -A Opera http://the.vict.im/stat/pixel.php -e "<script>alert(123123);</script>"`
*   **Referer Header:** The referrer field is manipulated to inject malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited without authentication.
*  **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know how the `lastnumber` parameter and the referrer field are handled.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vendor was notified and released a new version at freewebstat.com, although it does not specify which version fixes the vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory is from 2005, so it is possible the described versions are no longer in use.
*   The advisory was written by Francesco “ascii” Ongaro.
