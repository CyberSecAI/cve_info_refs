{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The MD5 algorithm used for EIGRP authentication only covers specific packet fields (Opcode, AS number, Flags, Sequence Number, Nexthop) and does not include the entire packet. This allows an attacker to replay captured, authenticated EIGRP Hello packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient authentication coverage: The MD5 hash does not cover all fields within the EIGRP packet, allowing for replay attacks.",
       "Lack of replay protection: The EIGRP implementation doesn't have countermeasures against replayed, validly authenticated packets."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:\n      - Information leakage: Triggered EIGRP update packets reveal additional information about the EIGRP domain's topology.\n      - Denial of Service: Replayed hello packets can disrupt neighbor relationships and cause routing instability, or even cause a sustained DoS attack by repeatedly tearing down and reforming neighbor relationships. The attack is also reportedly more efficient and causes slower recovery than previously known EIGRP DoS attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Packet sniffing: An attacker must first capture legitimate, authenticated EIGRP Hello packets.",
      "Packet replay: The attacker then replays the captured packets back to the EIGRP routers.",
      "EIGRP packet generator tool: An attacker can use a tool to automate the replay and potentially amplify the effect of the attack."

    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
       "Network access: The attacker needs to be able to sniff EIGRP packets and inject forged or replayed packets into the network.",
      "EIGRP knowledge: The attacker needs a basic understanding of the EIGRP protocol and how authentication works.",
      "EIGRP packet capture: Ability to sniff EIGRP traffic is required",
        "Packet injection: Ability to inject/replay packets to the targeted EIGRP device is required."
