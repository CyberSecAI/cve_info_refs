Based on the provided content, here's the relevant information regarding CVE-2005-4728:

*   **Vulnerability:** The `amaya` binary includes an RPATH (Run-Time Search Path) pointing to a directory within a user's home directory (`/home/anand/Debian/amaya/config--amaya-full/amaya-full/Amaya/WX/Mesa/lib`).
*   **Root Cause:** The build process for `amaya` inadvertently included a hardcoded RPATH pointing to a developer's home directory.
*   **Weakness:** Use of RPATH pointing to user home directory.
*   **Impact:** A local user who has access to the specified home directory (`/home/anand`) could place malicious libraries in that directory.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user could create and place malicious libraries in the RPATH directory. When `amaya` is executed, it would load these malicious libraries in preference to the system libraries.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a local user account and write access to the directory specified in the RPATH of the amaya binary.
