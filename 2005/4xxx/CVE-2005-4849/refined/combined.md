#### Description

Currently all attributes specified in the url with client get sent to the server as part of the database name (RDBNAM). They also print with DatabaseMetaData.getURL().

Since DRDA provides a separate mechanism for sending user and password these attributes should not be exposed in this way.

#### Description

In contrast to EmbeddedDriver, a connection attribute create=true is not recognized when presented as a property in a Properties object.

As a workaround I append the attributes from the Properties object to the url string before invoking the connect() method: then a new database is created and a connection is established.

Next code fragment illustrates the bug and the workaround:

private static final ClientDriver clientDriver = new ClientDriver();

private Connection getClientConnection(String database,

Properties connectionProperties) throws SQLException {

try

{
System.out.println("Try to connect with properties");
String connectionURL = "jdbc:derby://127.0.0.1:1527/" + database;
System.out.println("connectionURL: " + connectionURL);
Connection rv = clientDriver.connect(connectionURL,
connectionProperties);
System.out.println("Connection: " + rv);
return rv;
}

catch (SQLException e) {

System.out.println("Try to connect with URL attributes");

StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();

for (Enumeration enu = connectionProperties.propertyNames(); enu

.hasMoreElements()![](/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png)

{
String key = (String) enu.nextElement();
sb.append(';');
sb.append(key);
sb.append('=');
sb.append(connectionProperties.getProperty(key, ""));
}

String connectionURL = "jdbc:derby://127.0.0.1:1527/" + database

+ sb.toString();

System.out.println("connectionURL: " + connectionURL);

Connection rv = clientDriver.connect(connectionURL,

connectionProperties);

System.out.println("Connection: " + rv);

System.out

.println("!!!!!!!!!!! seems a bug: Properties argument in ClientDriver.connect(String, Properties) has not been used");

return rv;

}

}

## Distributions

Use the links below to download a distribution of Apache Derby from the archives. It is good practice to [verify the integrity](#Verifying+releases) of the distribution files.

There are three different distributions:

* bin distribution - contains the documentation, javadoc, and jar files for Derby.
* lib distribution - contains only the jar files for Derby.
* src distribution - contains the Derby source tree at the point which the binaries were built.

[db-derby-10.1.2.1-bin.zip](http://archive.apache.org/dist/db/derby/db-derby-10.1.2.1/db-derby-10.1.2.1-bin.zip) [[PGP](http://archive.apache.org/dist/db/derby/db-derby-10.1.2.1/db-derby-10.1.2.1-bin.zip.asc)] [[MD5](http://archive.apache.org/dist/db/derby/db-derby-10.1.2.1/db-derby-10.1.2.1-bin.zip.md5)]

There are two separate Eclipse plugins for Derby:

* derby\_core\_plugin - provides the Derby jar files to other plugins in Eclipse.
* derby\_ui\_plugin - provides an Apache Derby Nature in Eclipse for easy database application development.

Several test issues were reported, but no specific code issues were noted.

Tests for a specific platform can be run using the derbyTesting.jar file that can be found in the lib directory of the -lib or -bin distributions.

Instructions on how to run the tests can be found in the [testing README](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/branches/10.1/java/testing/README.htm).

## Verifying releases

It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP and MD5 signatures. MD5 verification ensures the file was not corrupted during the download process. PGP verification ensures that the file came from a certain person.

The PGP signatures can be verified using [PGP](http://www.pgpi.org/) or [GPG](http://www.gnupg.org/). First download the Apache Derby [KEYS](http://www.apache.org/dist/db/derby/KEYS) as well as the asc signature file for the particular distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using ...

```
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

or

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

or

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

```

To verify the MD5 signature on the files, you need to use a program called md5 or md5sum, which is included in many unix distributions. It is also available as part of [GNU Textutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html). Windows users can get binary md5 programs from [here](http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/), [here](http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/), or [here](http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/).

We strongly recommend you verify your downloads with both PGP and MD5.
