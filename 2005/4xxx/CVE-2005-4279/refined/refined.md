    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-4279",
      "root_cause": "Insecure paths were introduced into the list of directories searched for libraries at runtime. Additionally, packages using the MakeMaker Perl module may have incorrectly copied LD_RUN_PATH into DT_RPATH.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure library search paths",
         "Incorrect copying of LD_RUN_PATH to DT_RPATH"

      "impact": "A local attacker, member of the \"portage\" group, could create a malicious shared object in the Portage temporary build directory. This object could be loaded at runtime by a dependent executable, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",

        "Local access",
        "Malicious shared object injection"
