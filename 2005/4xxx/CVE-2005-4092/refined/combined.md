EEYEB-20051117B Apple iTunes (QuickTime.qts) Heap Overflow
Release Date:
January 10, 2006
Date Reported:
November 17, 2005
Patch Development Time (In Days):
54 Days
Severity:
High (Code Execution)
Vendor:
Apple
Systems Affected:
Quicktime on Windows 2000
Quicktime on Windows XP
Quicktime on Mac OS X 10.3.9
Apple iTunes on Windows 2000
Apple iTunes on Windows XP
Apple iTunes on OS X 10.3.9
Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a critical vulnerability in Apple
iTunes. The vulnerability allows an attacker to reliably overwrite heap
memory with user-controlled data and execute arbitrary code in the
context of the user who executed iTunes.
This specific flaw exists within the QuickTime.qts file which many
applications access QuickTime's functionality through. By specially
crafting atoms within a movie file, a direct heap overwrite is
triggered, and reliable code execution is then possible.
Technical Details:
The code in QuickTime.qts responsible for copying Movie Resource atom
type sizes in a QuickTime-format movie into an array allocated on the
heap. According to developer.apple.com, the format of the Movie Resource
atom is as follows:
Field Description
---------------------------
Atom Size 4 bytes
Atom Type 4 bytes
Data Variable
By supplying the .MOV file with a large atom size results in a
insufficiently-sized heap block to be allocated, resulting in a complete
heap memory overwrite ultimately failing in the List\_Component()
function.
References
QuickTime: QuickTime File Format
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/index.html
Vendor Status:
Apple has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available via the Updates section of the affected applications.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CAN-2004-0431.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

EEYEB-20051117A Apple QuickTime STSD Atom Heap Overflow
Release Date:
January 10, 2006
Date Reported:
November 17, 2005
Patch Development Time (In Days):
54 Days
Severity:
High (Code Execution)
Vendor:
Apple
Systems Affected:
Quicktime on Windows 2000
Quicktime on Windows XP
Quicktime on Mac OS X 10.3.9
Apple iTunes on Windows 2000
Apple iTunes on Windows XP
Apple iTunes on OS X 10.3.9
Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a critical vulnerability in
QuickTime Player. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to reliably
overwrite heap memory with user-controlled data and execute arbitrary
code in the context of the user who executed the player or application
hosting the QuickTime plug-in.
This specific flaw exists within the QuickTime.qts file which many
applications access QuickTime's functionality through. By specially
crafting atoms within a movie file, a direct heap overwrite is
triggered, and reliable code execution is then possible.
Technical Details:
Technical Description:
The code in QuickTime.qts responsible for the size of the Sample
Description Table entries from the 'stsd' atom in a QuickTime-format
movie on the heap. According to developer.apple.com, the format of the
Sample Description Atom is as follows:
Field Description
----------------------------------------------------------------
Size 32-bit int
Data Format 4 char code
Reserved 6 bytes that must be 0
Data Reference Index 16-bit int
Hint Track Version 16-bit unsigned int
Last compatible hint track version 16-bit unsigned int
Max Packet Size 32-bit int
Additional Data Table Variable
By setting the size of the Sample Description Table to a size of 00 15 -
00 D0 will cause a heap-based overflow. By supplying the "Last
compatible hint track version" field with the value of 00 05 - 00 09, an
insufficiently-sized heap block will be allocated, resulting in a
classic complete heap memory overwrite
during the RtlAllocateHeap() function and the attacker can control
memory with data taken from the filename of the .MOV file. This
vulnerability can be successfully exploited via an embedded media player
in an HTML page, email, or HTML link.

vulnerability.
Vendor Status:
Apple has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available via the Updates section of the affected applications.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2005-4092.

## Apple QuickTime fails to properly handle corrupt media files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#921193

Original Release Date: 2006-01-11 | Last Revised: 2006-01-12

---

### Overview

Apple QuickTime contains a heap overflow vulnerability in the handling of media files which may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Apple's [QuickTime Player](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/) is multimedia software that allows users to view local and remote audio, video, and image content. Quicktime contains a heap overflow vulnerability in code that handles the [stsd](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/APIREF/-stsd-.htm) atom of a media file.  This vulnerability may be triggered by using the QuickTime Player or an application that uses the QuickTime plug-in, such as a web browser.Note that this issue affects QuickTime installations on both Apple Mac and Windows operating systems. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service if the user is persuaded to view a specially crafted media file. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Install an update**Apple has addressed this issue with Quicktime 7.0.4, as specified in [Apple Support Document 303101](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303101). |
