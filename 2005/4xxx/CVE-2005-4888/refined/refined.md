      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-4888",
      "description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in the NetWare FTP Server (NWFTPD.NLM) where lengthy commands could cause a buffer overflow, stack corruption, and potentially lead to an abend of individual FTP session threads. This could, in rare cases, cause a system restart.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation within the FTP server, specifically a lack of checks on the length of commands sent by FTP clients, which results in a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Lack of input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation could lead to the termination of FTP session threads, potentially disrupting service. In severe cases, it could cause a system crash, requiring a restart.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is via the FTP protocol. An attacker sends specially crafted, lengthy commands to the vulnerable FTP server.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to the FTP server and send commands. No authentication is required as the vulnerability affects both anonymous and authenticated sessions."
