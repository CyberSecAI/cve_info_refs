{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The TellMe application does not properly filter malicious script content and allows access to command line options of the whois function via user-supplied input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper filtering of user input in the 'IP' or 'HOST' parameters.",
      "Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of input passed to the `whois` command.",
	  "Information disclosure vulnerability due to the application revealing the full path of the script in error outputs."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:\n\n1.  Execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user's browser via XSS.\n2.  Execute arbitrary commands on the server via command injection through the `whois` function.\n3.  Gain sensitive information about the server's file system due to path disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "XSS: Injecting malicious script into the 'q_Host' parameter of the URL.",
      "Command Injection: Prepending command options such as `--version` or `--help` to the host entry in the 'q_Host' parameter of the URL.",
      "Information Disclosure: Triggering error outputs by prepending \"--\" to the server and head options."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable TellMe application. This would typically involve the attacker persuading a user to click a malicious link or embedding the attack in a malicious website.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in TellMe v1.2 and earlier versions. The advisory includes proof-of-concept URLs demonstrating the exploits."
