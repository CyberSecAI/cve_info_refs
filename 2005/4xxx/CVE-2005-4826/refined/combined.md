| | Keynote **Simon Davies,** Privacy International | | --- | | Simon Davies is widely acknowledged as the world’s foremost privacy advocate. His work in the fields of civil rights, consumer protection and technology policy has spanned almost twenty years. Simon is perhaps best known as the founder and Director of the watchdog group Privacy International, but is also an academic, journalist, broadcaster and author.  Simon has worked extensively in more than 40 countries on issues ranging from national security, media privacy and human rights reform, through to international law and government data systems. He is the author of five books and more than a thousand articles, and writes regularly for publications such as the Los Angeles Times, the New York Daily News, the San Francisco Chronicle, Wired, The Daily Telegraph (London), The Guardian, The International Herald Tribune and the Sunday Times.  Simon has been a Visiting Law Fellow at both the University of Greenwich and the University of Essex, and since 1997 has been Visiting Fellow in the Department of Information Systems in the London School of Economics.  He has also advised a wide range of corporate, government and professional bodies including UNESCO, the European Parliament, the British Medical Association, UNISYS, the RAND Corporation, IBM and the UK Government. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Yersinia, A Framework For Layer 2 Attacks  David Barroso, Security Consultant, S21SEC Company Alfredo Andres Omella, Security Consultant, S21SEC Company | | --- | | Yersinia is a framework for performing layer 2 attacks. The following protocols have been implemented in Yersinia current version: Spanning Tree Protocol(STP), Virtual Trunking Protocol (VTP), Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP), Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), IEEE 802.1Q, Cisco Discovery Protocol and, finally, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Some of the attacks implemented will cause a DoS in a network, other will help to perform any other more advanced attack or both. In addition, some of them will be first released to the public since there aren’t any public implementation. Yersinia will definitely help both pen-testers and network administrators in their daily tasks. | | David Barroso has been involved in the security field for many years, playing around in different subjects like incident response or network security. He currently holds CISSP, GSEC and GCIA certifications, and there are two papers available in the internet: A practical approach for defeating Nmap OS-Fingerprinting and The Rise of the spammers  He has also coded some exploits, mainly for the pen-testing task. The last public exploit published is 'sslbomb', a DoS against IIS (MS04-11). He participates in several open source projects in the internet, and submit patches when possible (libnet, bins, linux counter, drac, ...) He also runs a mailing list for discussing forensics issues in spanish.  Alfredo Andres has always been interested in network security, coding different applications, both public and private. One of the public tools available is SING (http://sing.sf.net) used in some papers like Ofir Arkin’s ICMP usage in scanning. Besides, he usually help the community in different projects, submiting patches (tcpdump, libnet). He also holds the CISSP certification and has also coded some exploits, mainly for the pen-testing task. The last public exploit published is 'sslbomb', a DoS against IIS (MS04-11). |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Hacking PGP  **Jon Callas,** CTO, CSO, and Co-Founder, PGP Corporation | | --- | | PGP is the most secure, most widely used cryptosystem there is. But for every move there is a countermove. For every lock, there's a way to pick it.  Assume that you want to break a system that uses PGP as an underlying component. How would you do it? What would you do, how would you do it? This talk discusses how you would attack PGP cryptographically, in the network, in the computer system, and in the larger use system. More importantly, the techniques that will be discussed don't apply to PGP, they apply to \*any\* cryptosystem that you might use. | | Jon Callas joined PGP Corporation in July 2002 as Chief Technology Officer and Chief Security Officer. He co-designed the next-generation PGP products and was one of the main presenters to venture capital during the fund-raising for PGP Corporation. He is an innovator and an acknowledged expert in all major aspects of contemporary business security, including cryptography, operating system security, public key infrastructure, and intellectual property rights. He is the principal author of the Internet Engineering Task Force’s (IETF’s) OpenPGP standard and a writer and frequent lecturer on system security and intellectual property issues. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Hacking Windows Internals  **Cesar Cerrudo,** Application Security Inc. | | --- | | This presentation will show some internal Windows mechanims that still have flaws and that could be used as new explotation/attack vectors. Basically the presentation will cover some Windows IPC (Inter Process Communication) mechanisms that have been weakly designed or implemented. During this presentation methods and tools for helping in exploiting and detecting these new flaws will be showed. | | Cesar Cerrudo is a security researcher specialized in application security. Cesar currently works for Application Security, Inc. Regarded as a leading application security researcher, Cesar is credited with discovering and helping fix dozens of vulnerabilities in applications including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle database server, Microsoft BizTalk Server, Microsoft Commerce Server, Microsoft Windows, Yahoo! Messenger, etc. Cesar has authored several white papers on database and application security and has been invited to present at a variety of companies and conferences including Microsoft and Black Hat. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Symbian Security **Job de Haas,** Technical Director, ITSX | | --- | | The presentation will cover a basic intro into Symbian from a security perspective. It will show that it basically is security from the era of Windows 98. Possible topics include analysis of known viruses and trojans, attack demonstrations, tools to aid reverse engineering of Symbian OS programs or the OS itself. Show some differences between the different Symbian licensees such as Nokia and SonyEricsson. Show the security measures that have been taken or that could or should be taken. | | Job de Haas got involved in the area of Internet and security in 1991, during his studies in Electrical Engineering, when he responded to internet providers offers to hack their sites and win a free account. Following post-graduate studies in Control Engineering and three years of work in aerospace robotics at the Netherlands National Aerospace Laboratory, he worked for DigiCash, where he acquired experience in cryptographic techniques used in secure, anonymous payment systems for the Internet. Now, after leading ITSX for five years, Job moved to the position of Technical Director where he leads and supervises the penetration testing teams. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | A New Password Capture on Cisco System Devices **Stephen Dugan,** 101Labs | | --- | | This talk will show a new way to get a password from a Cisco administrator. This technique utilizes a couple of the most basic default settings within a Cisco box. Admittedly most admins turn this particular default off, not for security reasons, just because its down right annoying. Anyone willing to bring a laptop, plug into the test lab, an act the part of an administrator will get a first hand look into how this exploit works. This exploit is relatively simple in relation to understanding Cisco devices. Anyone attending, regardless of Cisco knowledge should be able to understand how this works. | | Stephen Dugan is currently an independent contract instructor and network engineer. He has been teaching Cisco networking for the last 3 years focusing on Router and Switch configuration, Voice/Data integration, and Network Security. His students come mostly from Fortune 500 companies and large service providers. He also teaches private internal classes to Cisco Employees. As a Sr. Network Engineer he has worked on the design and implementation of large enterprise, government contractor, and service provider networks. He is also working on a new series of security books entitled "Hacker Attacktecs." The first three planned books will cover Windows, Unix/Linux, and Cisco exploits and how to defend against them. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Building Zero-Day Self-Defending Web Applications: Enforcing Authoritative Action to stop Session Attacks Arian J. Evans, Senior Security Engineer, FishNet Security | | --- | | Web applications today suffer from state issues, weak session handling, and lack of stateful authorization. Many of the issues are well known, but the techniques for building secure applications are still relatively ignored. This is due to lack of documentation and awareness of the threats and attack methods; that landscape is rapidly changing.  Session and Authorization attacks are real, mature, and increasing in frequency of use in the wild. They are also misunderstood or ignored by most of the development and web application security community. This presentation will summarize and clarify State, Session, and Authorization attacks in a simple, effective Taxonomy, disclosing new Session and Authorization attacks disclosed in recent months.  Then we will detail new methods for defending web applications against Session and Authorization attacks, and along the way we might just limit what XSS and XST workflow-bypasses can accomplish. The techniques presented are simple, innovative, realistically usable, and predominantly missing in today's webapp designs. | | Arian Evans has spent the last seven years pondering information security, and disliking long bios. His focus over the years has been on intrusion detection and application security. In 2001 at the Seabeckcon "conference" he proposed 'reverse-IDS' for applications, was criticized, and later vindicated by the swelling of NBAD and ABAD devices that don't work.

During the last couple of years they have been used as a key information to detect and characterize DDoS attacks on the Internet. That's not their only interesting use. On an internal network (be it a large management network or a global entreprise IT network for example) they enable early detection of worm breakouts, infected workstations and covert channels to list a few examples. Network flows are also very helpful for forensics since quite often a full traffic dump isn't available (for multiple reasons: size, scalability, bandwidth, etc). Linking these two together gives a macroscopic view (netflow) of the network that can be linked with a microscopic view (full dump) "on demand". Network flows is to use them to build a baseline and detect policy violations, this enables the security administrator to "enforce" the security policy and detect people trying to circumvent it (using tunnels for example). We'll go through deployment scenarii and for each application show and list some examples of what to look for.

Are you tired of receiving e-mails from Citibank that resolve toMuscovite IP addresses? Would you like to hack the Kremlin? Or do you think that the Kremlin has probably owned you first? Maybe you just think that Anna Kournikova is hot. If the answer to any of the above questions is yes, then you need an introduction to the gulag archipelago of the Internet, the Cyberia of interconnected networks, Russia.  Do not let the persistent challenges of crossing international boundaries intimidate you any longer. In this briefing, we will follow several real-world scenarios back to Russia, and you will learn valuable strategies for taking your investigations and operations one big geographical step further. A brief introduction to Russia will be followed by 1,000 traceroutes over the frozen tundra explained in detail, along with an explanation of the relationship between cyber and terrestrial geography.  Quick: name one significant advantage that Russian hackers have over you. They can read your language, but you cannot read theirs! Since most Westerners cannot read Russian, the secrets of Russian hacking are largely unknown to Westerners. You will receive a ten-minute primer of the Russian language, to include network security terminology, software translation tools, and cross-cultural social engineering faux-pas (btw, this methodology will apply to cracking other exotic languages as well).  Finally, I will tie up, both in practical and in philosophical terms, a new methodology for crossing international frontiers in cyberspace. The briefing paves the way for amateur and professional hackers to move beyond their lonely linguistic and cultural orbit, in order to do battle on far-away Internet terrain. Contact information and resources for Russian hacking groups and law enforcement personnel will be provided, along with the results of personal interviews with Russian law enforcement figures conducted in Russian and translated for this briefing. | | Kenneth Geers (M.A., University of Washington, 1997) is an accomplished computer security expert and Russian linguist.

Shortly thereafter, Martin Herfurt of Salzburg Research Forschungsgesellschaft mbH expanded on these problems, and teamed up with Adam to investigate further. At EuroFoo in August 2004, Adam and Marcel Holtmann met, and agreed to colaborate on looking into the underlying causes of the problems, as well as sharing information and resources to try and gain a better foothold for the opensource community within the official bluetooth organistaions.  This talk will cover the issues arising out of the flaws, as well as the actual atack methodolgies and tools used, and an update on the industry's response and progress since the original discoveries.  This will be a fun talk and a real eye-opener for those with bluetooth enabled devices, and will start with an introduction into the Bluetooth architecture and the security mechanisms offered by it so that it is possible to understand how and why the different attacks are working. Further there will be an introduction into the Linux Bluetooth stack BlueZ that will be used for doing the attacks and showing exactly how these attacks are working.

He started in the computer industry in the late Seventies, working as a computer programmer on PDP-8 and other mini computers, and then on various Unix, Dos and CP/M based micro computers as they emerged in the Eighties. He quickly became interested in the underlying network and data protocols, and moved his attention to those areas and away from programming, starting a data conversion company which rapidly grew to become Europe's largest specialist in that field (A.L. downloading Services). During this period, he successfully disproved the industry lie that music CDs could not be read by computers, and, with help from his brother Ben, wrote the world's first CD ripper, 'CDGRAB'. At this point, he and Ben became interested in the newly emerging concept of 'The Internet', and were involved in various early open source projects, the most well known of which is probably their own—'Apache-SSL'—which went on to become the de-facto standard secure web server. Since the late Nineties they have focused their attention on security, and have been the authors of various papers exposing flaws in Internet services and/or software, as well as pioneering the concept of re-using military data centres (housed in underground nuclear bunkers - http://www.thebunker.net) as secure hosting facilities.

Then, it might be possible to launch different classes of attacks such as man in the middle, recording, cyphering attacks, denial of service, etc. To improve the security of such an architecture, it might be a good idea to limit access-point coverage to radiate out towards windows, but not beyond : but sometimes it might not stop attackers inside the company, and wireless devices become smaller and smaller (!). Most of the time, whitehats also try to harden wireless clients and AP, but recent attacks destroyed things like WEP, etc.  The purpose of this talk is to look at the weapons that might be used by whitehats in order to hide wireless devices and to prevent opportunistic attackers (wardrivers, etc). We will first look at usual solutions and their limitations (closed networks, etc). Then a new concept will be proposed, with interactive demos [bring your laptop and WLAN device, scanning will be allowed :-)].

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
