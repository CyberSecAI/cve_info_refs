The provided content describes vulnerabilities in SaralBlog, but the CVE ID provided (CVE-2005-4058) is different from those mentioned in the content (CVE-2006-0345 and CVE-2006-0346). Therefore, this content is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2005-4058.

However, here's a summary of the vulnerabilities described in the provided content:

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** User-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied input, specifically the website field in comments, is not sanitized before being displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Lack of input sanitization leads to the ability to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **XSS:** Unsanitized user input in the `website` field allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breaches (reading sensitive data from the database).
    *   Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data).
    *   Privilege escalation (potentially gaining administrative access).
*  **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Modifying the `id` parameter in `viewprofile.php` to inject SQL code.
    *   Injecting SQL code in search fields.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Providing malicious JavaScript in the `website` field when adding a comment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable pages.
*  **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to post or inject comments on a site running SaralBlog.
