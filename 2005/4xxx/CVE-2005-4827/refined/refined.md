The provided content describes a vulnerability in Microsoft's `Msxml2.XMLHTTP` ActiveX object used by Internet Explorer. This vulnerability allows bypassing the same-origin policy of XMLHttpRequest through the use of newline and tab characters.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A programming error in Microsoft's `Msxml2.XMLHTTP` ActiveX object allows a bypass of the same-origin policy of XMLHttpRequest via newline and tab characters in the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Same-origin policy bypass:** The core vulnerability is the ability to bypass the same-origin policy, allowing a script to interact with sites other than the one it originated from.
*   **Arbitrary HTTP request:** The vulnerable ActiveX object permits the sending of arbitrary HTTP requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Data exfiltration:** An attacker can extract sensitive information such as cookies and hidden form tokens.
*   **Intranet access:** With the use of a proxy server, the attacker can interact with intranet sites.
*   **Real-time web service interaction:** Attackers can scan internal web services, obtain real-time copies of site fronts, and interact with them using POST and GET requests with arbitrary payloads.
*   **Client-side backdoor:** This can turn into a client-side backdoor proxy.
*   **Spam and other malicious activities:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to send spam or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious web page:** The vulnerability can be exploited by simply having the victim visit a malicious website.
*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** In cases where XSS is possible on a vulnerable site, this vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Ability to host a malicious web page or inject malicious scripts:** The attacker needs to be able to host a web page or inject malicious scripts into an existing website that a victim visits.
*   **User Interaction:**  The victim needs to visit the malicious web page or interact with the XSS payload for the exploit to take place.
