# Perl, Qt-UnixODBC, CMake: RUNPATH issues — GLSA **200510-14**

Multiple packages suffer from RUNPATH issues that may allow users in the
"portage" group to escalate privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/perl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.8.7-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.8.7-r1**revision >= **5.8.6-r6** |

| Package | **dev-db/qt-unixODBC** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.3.4-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.3.4-r1** |

| Package | **dev-util/cmake** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.0-r1**revision >= **2.0.6-r1** |

### Background

Perl is a stable, cross-platform programming language created by Larry
Wall. Qt-UnixODBC is an ODBC library for Qt. CMake is a cross-platform
build environment.

### Description

Some packages may introduce insecure paths into the list of directories
that are searched for libraries at runtime. Furthermore, packages
depending on the MakeMaker Perl module for build configuration may have
incorrectly copied the LD\_RUN\_PATH into the DT\_RPATH.

### Impact

A local attacker, who is a member of the "portage" group, could create
a malicious shared object in the Portage temporary build directory that
would be loaded at runtime by a dependent executable, potentially
resulting in privilege escalation.

### Workaround

Only grant "portage" group rights to trusted users.

### Resolution

All Perl users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-lang/perl
```

All Qt-UnixODBC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/qt-unixODBC-3.3.4-r1"
```

All CMake users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-util/cmake
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
