Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-4836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The deprecated HTTP/1.1 connector in Apache Tomcat 4.1.x does not properly handle request URIs containing null bytes. Specifically, it fails to reject such URIs when used with contexts configured with `allowLinking="true"`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper input validation: The connector doesn't validate the request URI for null bytes.
- Reliance on deprecated component: The vulnerability exists within a deprecated HTTP/1.1 connector.
- Misconfiguration: `allowLinking="true"` must be enabled for a context for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can obtain the source code of any JSP page within the vulnerable contexts. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information present in JSP files, such as database credentials, logic, and potentially other configuration details.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker crafts a request URI containing null bytes (`\0`).
- The vulnerable HTTP/1.1 connector processes the request, failing to reject the URI because of null byte.
- The Tomcat configuration must have `allowLinking="true"` set.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the Tomcat server.
- The target application must be using the deprecated HTTP/1.1 connector.
- The context for the target JSP page must have `allowLinking="true"` set.

**Additional Notes:**

- The document explicitly states that there are no plans to issue an update for Tomcat 4.1.x to fix this issue.
- Users are advised to use the default, supported Coyote HTTP/1.1 connector, which is not vulnerable.
- This vulnerability exists specifically in Tomcat versions 4.1.15 up to 4.1.x-SVN, within the deprecated connector.
