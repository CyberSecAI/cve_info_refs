# TYPO3-20050725-1: TYPO3 Security Bulletin

Categories:
[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Ekkehard Gümbel

A debug script exposes system information provided by phpinfo(). By default, the script can be executed by a remote user.

**Component Type:** Core

**Affected** **Component:** Debug Script

**Version:** 3.8.0 and earlier
 **Vulnerability Type:** Information Disclosure
 **Severity:** Low

**Problem Description:**
 A debug script exposes system information provided by phpinfo(). The script can be executed by a remote user.

**Solution:**
 Remove the script, apply a patch or restrict access to the directory.

* Remove the directory typo3\_src-3.x.x/misc/phpcheck
* A patch to prevent execution of the script is available. In typo3\_src-3.x.x/misc/phpcheck/incfile.php, it inserts a die() function on top of the code. You can find it on [bugs.typo3.org/view.php](http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=1250)
* Use any of the favorite access restriction methods of your webserver. For example, in Apache, use mod\_access or mod\_auth directives.

**Additional information:**
 This issue is fixed in the CVS version of the TYPO3 core and will be fixed in 3.8.1 as well.

**References:**
 TYPO3 bugtracker, ID #1250 at [bugs.typo3.org/view.php](http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=1250)

**Credits:**
 Thanks to Christian Lerrahn for pointing out this issue to us.
