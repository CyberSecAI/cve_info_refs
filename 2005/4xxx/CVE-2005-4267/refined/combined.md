Qualcomm WorldMail IMAP Server String Literal Processing Overflow
Vulnerability
iDefense Security Advisory 12.20.05
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=359
December 20, 2005
I. BACKGROUND
Qualcomm WorldMail is an email and messaging server designed for use
in small to large enterprises that supports IMAP, POP3, SMTP, and web
mail features.
More information can be found on the vendors site:
http://www.eudora.com/worldmail/
II. DESCRIPTION
Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Qualcomm
WorldMail IMAP Server allows unauthenticated attackers to execute
arbitrary code.
III. ANALYSIS
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to
execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This leads to a total
compromise of the mail server.
In order to trigger this overflow, an attacker only needs to send a long
string ending with a '}' character. This will result in a stack overflow
and the attacker may use an SEH overwrite or a standard EBP or EIP
overwrite in order to gain control of the process trivially.
This is a pre-authentication vulnerability. To exploit this
vulnerability an attacker would need to be able connect to the e-mail
server and the IMAP module would have to be enabled (default). Only one
command is required to trigger this vulnerability.
IV. DETECTION
This exploit was tested against Qualcomm Worldmail server version 3.0.
Other versions may be vulnerable.
V. WORKAROUND
There is no workaround currently available except for disabling IMAP
services.
VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
The vendor was contacted according to the timeline shown but a response
has not yet been received. As this vulnerability has been publicly
disclosed at an alternate location
(http://seclists.org/lists/fulldisclosure/2005/Dec/1037.html) we are
proceeding with public disclosure.
VII. CVE INFORMATION
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CAN-2005-4267 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for
security problems.
VIII. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE
12/15/2005 Initial vendor notification
12/20/2005 Coordinated public disclosure

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
