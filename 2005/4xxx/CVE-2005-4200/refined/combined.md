| **[Chris Boulton](https://community.mybb.com/user-1.html)**  Offline   [Founder](https://mybb.com/about/team/#role-founder)    Posts: 5,042 Threads: 309 Joined: Jun 2004  Reputation:  [**88**](reputation.php?uid=1)      **[#1](thread-5184-post-30963.html#pid30963 "MyBB 1.0 Released")**   2005-12-09, 10:11 AM  (This post was last modified: 2007-02-17, 09:26 PM by [Chris Boulton](https://community.mybb.com/user-1.html).)   Today, the MyBB Group presents you with MyBB 1.0. MyBB is a powerful, efficient and free forum package developed in PHP and MySQL. Developed with the end users in mind, you and your subscribers will feel right at home with full control over their accounts as well as your control over your forums.  MyBB 1.0 marks the end in along and painful process of various beta releases in our attempt to create a stable working copy of MyBB safe for use in production environments.  This release also fixes two sets of important security vulnerabilities discovered in MyBB. imei reported one set of vulnerabilities, which will not be made public under any advisory. The second set, discovered by [tk](http://www.trapkit.de) fixes potential SQL injection problems with uncleaned variables. Coinciding with this release as an advisory outlining that these vulnerabilities exist, however no specific information will be released at this stage [details on affected arguments and files].  For this reason, we recommend all users update to 1.0 as soon as possible.  You may discuss this announcement here: <http://community.mybboard.net/showthread.php?tid=5185>  Thank you for your continued support, Chris Boulton & MyBB Group.  New Features / Changes We tried to keep the number of changes from PR2 to 1.0 at a bare minimum to ensure that new bugs weren't created. Noticeable changes include:  * A "Find Updated" link in the templates section which allows you to identify any custom templates that you currently have which have been updated since your last upgrade. * A new default theme, based on ideas off Chris, Darren and Kilroy. The new theme includes an updated image set and logo.  Where to from here? Several things are underway here at the MyBB Group. You'll be hearing more about this soon, such as where we're headed with MyBB now, as well as developments with documentation (the wiki), and team structural changes and new positions.  Upgrade Notes Upgrading your board follows the same simple process that RC4 -> PR2 did.   You will not lose any changed templates if you're running PR2. Earlier versions require a full revert to the standard MyBB templates.  Assuming you're already running PR2:  * Upload all of the MyBB files with the exception of inc/config.php, and inc/settings.php. * Run the upgrade script in your web browser at /install/upgrade.php. * After the upgrade is complete, login to your Admin CP and use the "Find Updated" tool in the templates section to search for any custom templates you have which may need to be updated. You'll need to update your custom templates to contain the new code, or revert them to the default.

Changed Templates Between PR2 and 1.0 there were a vast number of template changes made. Most edits were some minor mark-up changes or removing the "Reset" buttons on forms. For this reason, the list is fairly extensive and won�t be posted.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
