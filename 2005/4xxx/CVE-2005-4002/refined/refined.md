Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- WebEOC installations used a common, shared secret key for data encryption across all installations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Shared Secret Key:** The primary weakness is the use of a single, globally shared secret key across all WebEOC installations for data encryption.
- **Insecure Encryption:** The document implicitly suggests the encryption algorithm used prior to the fix was weak, as the fix implemented Rinjndael-AES and SHA-512.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Decryption:** If an attacker obtains the shared secret key from any WebEOC instance, they can decrypt data from *all* WebEOC installations.
- **Compromised Data:** The compromised data could include:
    - System settings
    - Emergency/medical data
    - Authentication information

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Key Retrieval:** The primary attack vector is obtaining the shared secret key from one of the WebEOC installations. The specific method for obtaining the key is not described in detail within this document, but it implies a vulnerability existed that made it possible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to WebEOC Installation:** The attacker needs some level of access to at least one WebEOC installation to extract the secret key. This could potentially be via some local file access or an insecure API.

**Additional notes:**
-  The vulnerability was addressed in WebEOC version 6.0.2 by utilizing a key unique to every customer.
- The fix also involved upgrading the encryption algorithms to Rinjndael-AES for encryption and SHA-512 for hash generation.
- The document indicates the vulnerability was discovered through external analysis by IOActive and reported by the City of Seattle.
- This document provides significantly more detailed information than a typical CVE description, which is usually limited to a brief summary of the vulnerability. This information includes the root cause, impact, and fix.

This vulnerability is associated with VU#388282, but there is no corresponding CVE assigned in the document.
