## WebEOC uses a global shared key

#### Vulnerability Note VU#388282

Original Release Date: 2005-07-13 | Last Revised: 2005-07-14

---

### Overview

WebEOC installations may use the a common secret key to encrypt data. If an attacker can retrieve this key from one site, they will be able to decipher all data encoded with the key across all WebEOC installations.

### Description

| WebEOC is a web-based crisis information management application that provides functions to gather, coordinate, and disseminate information between emergency personnel and Emergency Operations Centers (EOC). All WebEOC installations may use a common secret key to encrypt data. If an attacker can successfully recover this secret key from any WebEOC installation, they may be able to decrypt data on every other WebEOC installation. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If this shared key is recovered by an attacker, that attacker may be able to decrypt all data encrypted using that key in all WebEOC installations. Such data that may be compromised may include system settings, emergency/medical data, and authentication information. |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Version 6.0.2 corrects this vulnerability. According to ESi:*This vulnerability has been addressed in version 6.0.2 by utilizing a key unique to every customer (these keys existed previously, but were not used). In addition, data encryption is now accomplished using Rinjndael-AES encryption algorithms and hashes are generated with SHA-512 algorithms.*To obtain WebEOC upgrades, contact ESi [Technical Support](http://www.esi911.com/esi/support/support.htm)*.* |
