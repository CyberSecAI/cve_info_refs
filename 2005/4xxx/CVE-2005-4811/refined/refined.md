Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-4811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the hugepage table support within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the issue occurs when an `mmap()` call fails during hugepage allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Handling of Failed `mmap()`:** The kernel does not properly handle a failed `mmap()` call when dealing with hugepages. This can lead to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unprivileged local user can trigger a kernel crash by manipulating hugepage allocations, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged Local User:**  An attacker needs to be a local user on the system, without requiring special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to trigger hugepage allocation:** The attacker must be able to trigger a failed mmap call during hugepage allocation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affected the `linux-2.6.9-x86_64-hugetlb.patch` which was added in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Update 1 (RHSA-2005:520)
*   The vulnerability was fixed in RHSA-2006-0689.
*   The issue is related to a patch merged in upstream kernels > 2.6.12, but Red Hat backported a vulnerable patch to RHEL4.
*   The bug report indicates the initial report did not come with a reproducer, but the patch was fairly straightforward to craft based on upstream fixes.
