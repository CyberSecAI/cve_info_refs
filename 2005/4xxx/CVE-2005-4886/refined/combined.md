Message-ID: <1002220907330.11676@mjc.redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 22 Feb 2010 09:09:35 +0000 (GMT)
From: Mark J Cox <mjc@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE-2005-4886 assigned to old remote oops

<http://git.kernel.org/linus/0d3d077cd4f11>

This issue should have got a CVE name back in 2005 when it was discovered
to be a security issue, but probably didn't affect any other vendor at the
time.  Fixed upstream in 2.6.12, more details at:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=160117#c12>

Thanks, Mark

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=160117#c0)  Issue Tracker    2005-06-10 19:53:57 UTC  ``` Escalated to Bugzilla from IssueTracker  [SELINUX]: Fix ipv6_skip_exthdr() invocation causing OOPS. author	Herbert Xu <herbert.org.au>	 	Mon, 25 Apr 2005 03:16:19 +0000 (20:16 -0700) committer	David S. Miller <davem>	 	Mon, 25 Apr 2005 03:16:19 +0000 (20:16 -0700) The SELinux hooks invoke ipv6_skip_exthdr() with an incorrect length final argument.  However, the length argument turns out to be superfluous.  I was just reading ipv6_skip_exthdr and it occured to me that we can get rid of len altogether.  The only place where len is used is to check whether the skb has two bytes for ipv6_opt_hdr.  This check is done by skb_header_pointer/skb_copy_bits anyway.  Now it might appear that we've made the code slower by deferring the check to skb_copy_bits.  However, this check should not trigger in the common case so this is OK.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=160117#c9)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2005-10-05 13:28:11 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-514.html>    ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=160117#c11)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-02-19 13:36:57 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/0d3d077cd4f1154e63a9858e47fe3fb1ad0c03e5>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=160117#c12)  Mark J. Cox    2010-02-19 13:53:01 UTC  ``` This should have been given a security bug and CVE in 2005.  To figure out why it didn't here is the timeline:  Apr 22, 2005 - issue reported in netdev  Apr 24, 2005 - patch committed                <http://git.kernel.org/linus/0d3d077cd4f11>                kind of hints to security consequences                (made upstream 2.6.12)  Apr 25, 2005 - Red Hat customer notices commit and raises internal                issue tracker (IT) asking for a backported bug fix                for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (the only distro we                are shipping that is affected).  Jun  9, 2005 - Bug get approval to be fixed, backported patch                 created, committed to our source tree, this                bug raised in bugzilla by support group.  Built                 into an updated Red Hat kernel ready to be                 shipped as part of RHEL4 "Update 2"  Sep 02, 2005 - Arjan mails vendor-sec mentioning that this looks to                 have been the issue behind some recent kernel.org crashes,                makes this a security bug, alerts Red Hat security response                team.  Oct 05, 2005 - RHEL4 Update 2 ships containing the fix  On Sep 2nd we should have asked for a CVE name for the issue (it was before we were a naming authority) and then added it to the existing RHEL4 Update 2 security advisory.  It's too long ago to remember the reason why this didn't happen, I expect it was forgotten as no SRT action was actually required (issue was already patched and in an update release, just not actually pushed out yet).  Usually this would have been caught earlier as any of the other vendors who may have been vulnerable would have asked for a name via vendor-sec.  Brad Spengler brought this missing CVE name to our attention so we've applied for a CVE name and will update this bug and our errata with it shortly.  [this issue is [CVE-2005-4886](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-4886)]   ``` |  |
