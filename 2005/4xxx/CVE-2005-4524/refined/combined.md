BugTraq IDs    : 15842 16046
Debian Bug     : 345288

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mantis, a
web-based bug tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-4238

    Missing input sanitising allows remote attackers  to inject
    arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2005-4518

    Tobias Klein discovered that Mantis allows remote attackers to
    bypass the file upload size restriction.

CVE-2005-4519

    Tobias Klein discovered several SQL injection vulnerabilities that
    allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2005-4520

    Tobias Klein discovered unspecified "port injection"
    vulnerabilities in filters.

CVE-2005-4521

    Tobias Klein discovered a CRLF injection vulnerability that allows
    remote attackers to modify HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response
    splitting attacks.

CVE-2005-4522

    Tobias Klein discovered several cross-site scripting (XSS)
    vulnerabilities that allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary
    web script or HTML.

CVE-2005-4523

    Tobias Klein discovered that Mantis discloses private bugs via
    public RSS feeds, which allows remote attackers to obtain
    sensitive information.

CVE-2005-4524

    Tobias Klein discoverd that Mantis does not properly handle "Make
    note private" when a bug is being resolved, which has unknown
    impact and attack vectors, probably related to an information
    leak.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.2-5sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mantis package.

Hash: SHA1
Advisory: Multiple vulnerabilities in Mantis
Name: TKADV2005-11-002
Revision: 1.0
Release Date: 2005/12/23
Last Modified: 2005/12/23
Date Reported: 2005/11/04
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: Mantis (all versions <= 0.19.3)
Risk: Critical ( ) High ( ) Medium (x) Low (x)
Vendor URL: http://www.mantisbt.org
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
=========
Overview:
=========
Mantis is a widely used php/MySQL/web based bugtracking system.
Version 0.19.3 and prior contain multiple Cross Site Scripting,
SQL Injection and HTTP Header CRLF Injection vulnerabilities.
Furthermore it is possible to conduct a denial of service attack
under certain circumstances.
======================
Vulnerability details:
======================
For a description of the calculation of the resulting threat of a
vulnerability see reference [3].
All vulnerabilities are exploitable, no matter if magic\_quotes\_gpc
is turned on or off.
[1] SQL Injection
Possible damage: Critical
Probability of occurrence: Low
Resulting threat: Medium
HTTP method: GET
Vulnerability description:
Mantis is prone to a SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is
due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before
using it in an SQL query.
Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the
application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an
attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database
implementation.
This vulnerability can only be successfully exploited by the
administrative user.
Vulnerable GET parameter: prefix
Proof of Concept (GET request):
[path\_to\_mantis]/manage\_user\_page.php?prefix=A[SQL]
[2] SQL Injection
Possible damage: Critical
Probability of occurrence: Low
Resulting threat: Medium
HTTP method: POST
Vulnerability description:
Mantis is prone to a SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is
due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before
using it in an SQL query.
Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the
application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an
attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database
implementation.
This vulnerability can only be successfully exploited by the
administrative user.
Vulnerable URL:
[path\_to\_mantis]/manage\_user\_page.php
Vulnerable POST parameter: sort
Proof of Concept (POST request):
POST [path\_to\_mantis]/manage\_user\_page.php HTTP/1.1
[...]
sort=username[SQL]&dir=ASC&save=1
[3] SQL Injection
Possible damage: Low
Probability of occurrence: High
Resulting threat: Low
HTTP method: GET
Vulnerability description:
Mantis is prone to a SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is
due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before
using it in an SQL query.
Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the
application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an
attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database
implementation.
This vulnerability can be successfully exploited by any anonymous
user.
As it is only possible to inject SQL after the ORDER BY statement
it is very unlikely that this vulnerability can be exploited to
do harmful things. Thats why the possible damage is rated as low.
Vulnerable GET Parameter: sort
Proof of Concept (GET request):
[path\_to\_mantis]/view\_all\_set.php?sort=priority[SQL]
[4] Cross Site Scripting
Possible damage: Medium
Probability of occurrence: Low
Resulting threat: Low
HTTP method: GET
XSS type: non-persistent
Vulnerability description:
The "view\_type" parameter is prone to cross-site scripting attacks.
This could permit remote attackers to create a malicious link to a
vulnerable PHP script that includes hostile client-side script code
or HTML. If this link is visited, the attacker-supplied code may be
rendered in the browser of the user who visit the malicious link.
This vulnerability can be successfully exploited by any anonymous
user.
Vulnerable GET parameter: view\_type
Proof of Concept:
[path\_to\_mantis]/view\_filters\_page.php?target\_field=reporter\_id[]&
view\_type=">
[5] Cross Site Scripting
Possible damage: Medium
Probability of occurrence: Low
Resulting threat: Low
HTTP method: GET
XSS type: non-persistent
Vulnerability description:
The "target\_field" parameter is prone to cross-site scripting
attacks. This could permit remote attackers to create a malicious
link to a vulnerable PHP script that includes hostile client-side
script code or HTML. If this link is visited, the attacker-supplied
code may be rendered in the browser of the user who visit the
malicious link.
This vulnerability can be successfully exploited by any anonymous
user.
Vulnerable GET parameter: target\_field
Proof of Concept:
[path\_to\_mantis]/view\_filters\_page.php?target\_field=
">
[6] HTTP Header CRLF Injection
Possible damage: Medium
Probability of occurrence: Low
Resulting threat: Low
HTTP method: GET
Vulnerability description:
There is no input validation performed on user data passed to the
"return"-parameter of the application. As a result, malicious users
may embed CR/LF sequences to inject additional headers into
outgoing messages.
This vulnerability can be successfully exploited by any anonymous
user.
Vulnerable GET parameter: return
Proof of Concept:
[path\_to\_mantis]/login\_cookie\_test.php?return=
%0d%0aLocation:%20http://www.google.com
[7] HTTP Header CRLF Injection
Possible damage: Medium
Probability of occurrence: Low
Resulting threat: Low
HTTP method: POST
Vulnerability description:
There is no input validation performed on user data passed to the
"ref"-parameter of the application. As a result, malicious users
may embed CR/LF sequences to inject additional headers into
outgoing messages.
This vulnerability can be successfully exploited by any anonymous
user.
URL with vulnerable POST parameter:
[path\_to\_mantis]/login\_select\_proj\_page.php?ref=bug\_report\_page.php
Vulnerable POST parameter: ref
Proof of Concept (POST request):
POST [path\_to\_mantis]/set\_project.php HTTP/1.0
[...]
ref=%0d%0aLocation:%20http://www.google.com&project\_id=1
[8] Upload files with arbitrary size
Possible damage: Medium
Probability of occurrence: Low
Resulting threat: Low
HTTP method: POST
Vulnerability description:
When the uploading functionality is activated (see config\_inc.php)
it is possible to upload files with an arbitrary size.
Normally uploaded files have a max size of 2,000k. This gets
enforced by the form-data parameter 'name="max\_file\_size"'. It is
possible to manipulate this parameter to an arbitrary value. As the
file gets directly uploaded to the database it is possible to fill
the available disk space of the database and cause a denial of
service.
This vulnerability can be successfully exploited by any anonymous
user.
URL with vulnerable POST form:
[path\_to\_mantis]/view.php?id=1
Vulnerable POST request:
POST [path\_to\_mantis]/bug\_file\_add.php HTTP/1.1
[...]
-----------------------------263932646429032
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="bug\_id"
1
-----------------------------263932646429032
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="max\_file\_size"
2000000 <--- this value can be easily modified
[...]
Other URLs with vulnerable upload feature:
[path\_to\_mantis]/bug\_report.php
[path\_to\_mantis]/bug\_report\_advanced\_page.php
[path\_to\_mantis]/proj\_doc\_add\_page.php

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
