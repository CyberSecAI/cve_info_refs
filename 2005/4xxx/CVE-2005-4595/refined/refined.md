{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The XnView package for IA32 used the DT_RPATH field insecurely, causing the dynamic loader to search for shared libraries in potentially untrusted directories.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of DT_RPATH field.",
      "Application searches for shared libraries in untrusted locations"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could create a malicious shared object that would be loaded and executed when a user attempted to use an XnView utility. This would allow a malicious user to effectively hijack XnView and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the program.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker creates malicious shared object"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local attacker with the ability to write to a directory where XnView searches for shared libraries."
