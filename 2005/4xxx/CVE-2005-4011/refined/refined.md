Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-4011

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `calendar.php` file of the Codewalkers ltwCalendar (also known as PHP Event Calendar).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL command execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network access.
-  `id` parameter: The vulnerability is specifically triggered via the `id` parameter in the `calendar.php` file. This parameter likely takes user-supplied input, which the application does not sanitize.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
-  Basic knowledge of SQL injection: The attacker must be familiar with SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable software is Codewalkers ltwCalendar versions 4.2, 4.1.3, and earlier.
- The vendor acknowledged the vulnerability and fixed it in version 4.2.1.
- There are multiple references to the vulnerability with slightly different names ("ltwCalendar - PHP Event Calendar" and "PHP Event Calendar").
