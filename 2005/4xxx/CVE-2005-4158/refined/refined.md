{
  "CVE-2005-4158": {
    "Description": "A flaw exists in sudo's environment sanitizing prior to sudo version 1.6.8p12 that could allow a malicious user with permission to run a perl script to execute arbitrary perl code.",
    "Root cause": "Improper sanitization of environment variables that influence Perl's library search path.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient filtering of PERL5LIB, PERLLIB, and PERL5OPT environment variables when executing Perl scripts via sudo."
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious user with sudo access to execute a perl script can use the vulnerability to include and execute their own library file with the same name as a system library file included by the perl script. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation occurs by manipulating PERL5LIB, PERLLIB, and PERL5OPT environment variables to point to attacker-controlled directories containing malicious Perl libraries.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have sudo access to run a perl script that does not have tainting turned on."
  }
}
