How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This would be the typical practice.  We weren't tracking kernel bugs at
the function-name level back then, though - we were using more mature (and
more general) advisory descriptions - so I can't be absolutely sure
whether there's a CVE for this or not.

However, a search for "netlink" turned up empty for this type of problem
in that time frame, so we probably don't have a CVE for it yet.

One question, though - <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/32830/> patches
net/sched/sch_api.c / tc_fill_tclass, but the 2005 patch includes
net/core/neighbour.c, net/sched/cls_api.c, and others.

So we have:

tc_fill_qdisc() - already fixed in 2.6; just fixed in 2.4

  <http://marc.info/?l=git-commits-head&m=112002138324380>
  (not sure of reference for 2.4)

multiple functions e.g. tcf_fill_node() already fixed in 2.6; unknown
status in 2.4.  Includes neightbl_fill_info(), neightbl_fill_param_info(),
and others.

  <http://marc.info/?l=git-commits-head&m=112002138324380>

tc_fill_tclass() - just fixed in 2.6

  <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/32830/>

So for now, we have:

  CVE-2009-3228 - tc_fill_tclass()

  CVE-2005-4881 - tc_fill_qdisc()  (at least)

Now we have:

  tcf_fill_node(), neightbl_fill_info(), and others from 2005.

Typical practice would be to associate tcf_fill_node() and the others with
CVE-2005-4881, not just have it be with tc_fill_qdisc() - because they
were all disclosed in 2005.  Then the 2.4 fix might only apply to a
portion of CVE-2005-4881.  This could make it difficult to coordinate
low-level patches, but our "(1)" and "(2)" numbering style in the CVE
description could be used at that level if needed.

So, let's go with these two numbers.  I'll fill them out later.  (My head
hurts.)

Oh, and if anybody could give me more precise version information than
"2.4" and "2.6" then that would be appreciated.

- Steve

P.S. I chose the 2005 date in the CVE to help with distinguishing the
problems, but arguably this should have received a 2009, because the 2005
fix was so vague that the security implications weren't (apparently) known
until 2009.

Thanks Eugene, that's very kind. I have merged all 4 patches and
pushed them to the master repo. I'm not releasing right now because
those vulns are minor and I still have other issues to fix.

Willy

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update fixes a several security issues and various bugs in the
SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP 2 kernel.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2009-3939: A sysctl variable of the megaraid\_sas driver was
world writable, allowing local users to cause a denial of service
or potential code execution.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.6 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-4005: The collect\_rx\_frame function in
drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc\_usb.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32-rc7
allows attackers to have an unspecified impact via a crafted HDLC
packet that arrives over ISDN and triggers a buffer under-read.
This requires the attacker to be ISDN link-local.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (HIGH) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3080: A negative offset in a ioctl in the GDTH RAID driver
was fixed.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (HIGH) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-4021: The fuse\_direct\_io function in fs/fuse/file.c in the
fuse subsystem in the Linux kernel might allow attackers to cause a
denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and OOPS) via vectors
possibly related to a memory-consumption attack.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3889: The dbg\_lvl file for the megaraid\_sas driver in the
Linux kernel before 2.6.27 has world-writable permissions, which
allows local users to change the (1) behavior and (2) logging level
of the driver by modifying this file.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.6 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
CVE-2009-2903: Memory leak in the AppleTalk subsystem in the Linux
kernel when the AppleTalk and ipddp modules are loaded but the ipddp"N"
device is not found, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption) via IP-DDP datagrams.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.1 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3621: net/unix/af\_unix.c in the Linux kernel allows local
users to cause a denial of service (system hang) by creating an
abstract-namespace AF\_UNIX listening socket, performing a shutdown
operation on this socket, and then performing a series of connect
operations to this socket.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3612 / CVE-2005-4881: The tcf\_fill\_node function in
net/sched/cls\_api.c in the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.x
before 2.6.32-rc5, and 2.4.37.6 and earlier, does not initialize a
certain tcm\_\_pad2 structure member, which might allow local users
to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via unspecified
vectors. NOTE: this issue existed because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2005-4881.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N)
CVE-2009-3620: The ATI Rage 128 (aka r128) driver in the Linux
kernel does not properly verify Concurrent Command Engine (CCE)
state initialization, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified ioctl calls.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3726: The nfs4\_proc\_lock function in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c
in the NFSv4 client in the Linux kernel allows remote NFS servers
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic)
by sending a certain response containing incorrect file attributes,
which trigger attempted use of an open file that lacks NFSv4 state.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3613: The swiotlb functionality in the r8169 driver in
drivers/net/r8169.c in the Linux kernel allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (IOMMU space exhaustion and system crash)
by using jumbo frames for a large amount of network traffic, as
demonstrated by a flood ping.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
The rio and sx serial multi port card drivers were disabled via a
modprobe blacklist due to severe bugs.
For a full list of changes, please read the RPM changelog.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

2.4 kernels appear to be affected as well, and moreover they appear to
require at least some of these older fixes as well:

<http://marc.info/?l=git-commits-head&m=112002138324380>

Specifically, in net/sched/sch_api.c both tc_fill_qdisc() and
tc_fill_tclass() are affected - the former was fixed in 2.6 in 2005,
the latter is being fixed now.

I'm not sure what this means for CVE.  Should there be another CVE id
for the issues fixed in 2.6 in 2005 (if one was not allocated at the
time), and 2.4 could reference both CVE ids now?

I did not check if any of the affected code is possibly normally only
available to root, but even if so the issue may be relevant on systems
with containers.

Thanks for letting me know.

I'm late on fixes these days. I still have several ones to apply but
need to find time to work on them.

Personally I have no problem referencing an old CVE in a recent
commit if it helps tracking common bugs. And I think we've already
done that in the past.

In general I tend to consider those "bytes leak" bugs with lower
importance, but they need to be fixed anyway since they may eventually
impact some random setup somewhere.

Thanks,
Willy

This one is here in 2.4 :

Here in 2.4 :

in 2.4, was fixed with the other one above from 2005 (0f3f23).

OK, for 2.4, all the issues mentionned here were fixed in 2.4.37.6 and present
up to 2.4.37.5.

In 2.6 now :

  - tc_fill_tclass was fixed in 2.6.31-rc9 (commit 16ebb5e0)
  - neightbl_fill_info, tcf_fill_node, tc_fill_qdisc... in 2.6.13-rc1
    (commit 9ef1d4c7)

OK, thanks Steven.
