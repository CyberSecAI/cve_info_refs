Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2005-4518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Mantis does not properly enforce file upload size restrictions, allowing attackers to bypass the intended limits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload Size:** The application relies on a form parameter (`max_file_size`) to limit file upload size, which can be manipulated by an attacker.
*   **Direct Database Upload:** Files are directly uploaded to the database without proper size validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can upload very large files, filling the available disk space on the database server, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `max_file_size` parameter within a POST request.
*   **Vulnerable URLs:** Several file upload functionalities are vulnerable:
    *   `[path_to_mantis]/view.php?id=1`
    *   `[path_to_mantis]/bug_file_add.php`
    *   `[path_to_mantis]/bug_report.php`
    *   `[path_to_mantis]/bug_report_advanced_page.php`
    *   `[path_to_mantis]/proj_doc_add_page.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any anonymous user, without requiring prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `max_file_size` parameter, usually set to 2000k, is intended to limit file uploads. However, this parameter can be changed to an arbitrary value in the HTTP POST request.
*   The file is uploaded directly into the database.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory from trapkit.de provides more technical detail, including HTTP request examples.
*   The Gentoo advisory also mentions this as a file upload vulnerability in the context of multiple vulnerabilities.
*   The Debian security advisory mentions the discovery of this vulnerability by Tobias Klein.
