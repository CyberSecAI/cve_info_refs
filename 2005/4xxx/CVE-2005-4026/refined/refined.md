The provided content describes two security issues fixed in Geeklog 1.3.11sr3:

**1. Comment Submission Without Read Permissions:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks when submitting comments.
*   **Weakness:** It was possible to post comments on stories or topics even if the user did not have the necessary read permissions for that content.
*   **Impact:** Users could potentially leave comments on content they are not supposed to access, bypassing intended access controls.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker would need to know the story's ID to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need to be a user able to submit comments but lack read permission for specific content.

**2. Path Disclosure via Search Date Tampering:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the system disclosing the installation path within a warning message when search dates are manipulated.
*   **Weakness:** Tampering with the dates in a search query would cause Geeklog to display a warning message that included the full server path where Geeklog was installed.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker could gain information about the server's file system structure.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker would need to manipulate search dates.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would only require the ability to perform searches. The content explicitly mentions that this could **not** be used for SQL injection.

The content also mentions that the identified issues were also present in Geeklog 1.4.0b1 but were fixed in the CVS version.
