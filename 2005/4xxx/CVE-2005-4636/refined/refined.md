**CVE Relevance:**

The provided content is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2005-4636. The content from qa.openoffice.org describes a bug report for Apache OpenOffice, specifically regarding the hyperlink dialog and its respect for security settings. CVE-2005-4636 relates to a different vulnerability in a different application.

**Vulnerability Details (from OpenOffice Bugzilla content):**

*   **Root cause:** The "WWW-Browser" button in the Hyperlink dialog did not respect the security setting that disables hyperlink execution. This setting is controlled by the configuration item "Office.Security/HyperLinks/Open". If this value was set to 0, clicking the button should not open a browser.
*   **Weakness:** The weakness lies in the inconsistent application of the security setting. The dialog's button was not checked against the "Office.Security/HyperLinks/Open" setting, allowing users to potentially bypass security restrictions.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** If exploited, users could potentially bypass security settings to open URLs, even if hyperlink execution is explicitly disabled.
*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector would involve a user having hyperlink execution disabled in the openoffice settings and then attempting to use the "WWW-Browser" button in the hyperlink dialog.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific attacker position or capability is needed other than being a user of openoffice with the hyperlink execution disabled.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report indicates that the issue was fixed by a change introduced in another issue, #i53490.
*   The fix was verified and the issue was closed.
*   The issue is classified as an "ENHANCEMENT," suggesting that this behavior was not necessarily considered a security vulnerability, but a lack of full feature implementation.
