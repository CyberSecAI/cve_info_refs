| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=53491#c0)  kai.sommerfeld    2005-08-18 13:12:31 UTC  ``` In case execution of hyperlinks has been disabled by setting value of config item â€œOffice.Security/HyperLinks/Openâ€ to 0 (zero), we need to ensure that clicking the WWW-browser button in Hyperlink dialog's internet tabpage will produce an error message stating that execution of hyperlinks is forbidden due to current security settings.  IMPORTANT: It might be the case that for this issue there is nothing todo after #i53490# has been fixed. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=53491#c1)  kai.sommerfeld    2005-08-18 13:13:24 UTC  ``` . ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=53491#c2)  kai.sommerfeld    2005-08-26 08:32:49 UTC  ``` Fix for #i53490# also fixed this issue. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=53491#c3)  kai.sommerfeld    2005-08-26 08:34:27 UTC  ``` .  re-open issue and reassign to kso@openoffice.org ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=53491#c4)  kai.sommerfeld    2005-08-26 08:34:33 UTC  ``` reassign to kso@openoffice.org ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=53491#c5)  kai.sommerfeld    2005-08-26 08:34:38 UTC  ``` reset resolution to FIXED ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=53491#c6)  kai.sommerfeld    2005-09-30 11:43:27 UTC  ``` Verified. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=53491#c7)  kai.sommerfeld    2005-11-18 13:55:04 UTC  ``` Works fine in MWS m141.
