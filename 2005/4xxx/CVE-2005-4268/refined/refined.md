{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `cpio` utility due to the assumption that the file size would have a maximum of 8 digits when creating the archive header.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation"
     ],
    "impact": "The buffer overflow leads to program termination and can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution, although the provided details do not confirm this.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing `cpio` with an archive containing files with larger sizes that exceed the expected number of digits.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to create a crafted archive with a file having a large file size that exceeds the buffer, then have a victim extract/process it with a vulnerable `cpio` version."
