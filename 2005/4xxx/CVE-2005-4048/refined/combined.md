How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : xine-lib
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-4048
Debian Bug     : 342208

Simon Kilvington discovered that specially crafted PNG images can trigger
a heap overflow in libavcodec, the multimedia library of ffmpeg, which may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
xine-lib includes a local copy of libavcodec.

The old stable distribution (woody) isn't affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1.5.

We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# xine-lib, FFmpeg: Heap-based buffer overflow — GLSA **200601-06**

xine-lib and FFmpeg are vulnerable to a buffer overflow that may be
exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/xine-lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.1-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.1-r3** |

| Package | **media-video/ffmpeg** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.4.9\_p20051216** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.4.9\_p20051216** |

### Background

xine is a GPL high-performance, portable and reusable multimedia
playback engine. xine-lib is xine's core engine. FFmpeg is a very fast
video and audio converter and is used in xine-lib.

### Description

Simon Kilvington has reported a vulnerability in FFmpeg
libavcodec. The flaw is due to a buffer overflow error in the
"avcodec\_default\_get\_buffer()" function. This function doesn't properly
handle specially crafted PNG files as a result of a heap overflow.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run an FFmpeg based
application on a maliciously crafted PNG file, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.1-r3"
```

All FFmpeg users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/ffmpeg-0.4.9_p20051216"
```

# MPlayer: Multiple integer overflows — GLSA **200603-03**

MPlayer is vulnerable to integer overflows in FFmpeg and ASF decoding that
could potentially result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/mplayer** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.20060217** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.20060217**>= **1.0\_pre8** |

### Background

MPlayer is a media player capable of handling multiple multimedia file
formats.

### Description

MPlayer makes use of the FFmpeg library, which is vulnerable to a heap
overflow in the avcodec\_default\_get\_buffer() function discovered by
Simon Kilvington (see GLSA 200601-06). Furthermore, AFI Security
Research discovered two integer overflows in ASF file format decoding,
in the new\_demux\_packet() function from libmpdemux/demuxer.h and the
demux\_asf\_read\_packet() function from libmpdemux/demux\_asf.c.

### Impact

An attacker could craft a malicious media file which, when opened using
MPlayer, would lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. This could result
in the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running MPlayer.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0.20060217"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : vlc
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-4048
Debian Bug     : 342208

Simon Kilvington discovered that specially crafted PNG images can trigger
a heap overflow in libavcodec, the multimedia library of ffmpeg, which may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
The vlc media player links statically against libavcodec.

The old stable distribution (woody) isn't affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.1.svn20050314-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.4.debian-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your vlc package.

Upgrade Instructions

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# GStreamer FFmpeg plugin: Heap-based buffer overflow — GLSA **200602-01**

The GStreamer FFmpeg plugin is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that may be
exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-plugins/gst-plugins-ffmpeg** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.7-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.7-r1** |

### Background

The GStreamer FFmpeg plugin uses code from the FFmpeg library to
provide fast colorspace conversion and multimedia decoders to the
GStreamer open source media framework.

### Description

The GStreamer FFmpeg plugin contains derived code from the FFmpeg
library, which is vulnerable to a heap overflow in the
"avcodec\_default\_get\_buffer()" function discovered by Simon Kilvington
(see GLSA 200601-06).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run an application using
the GStreamer FFmpeg plugin on a maliciously crafted PIX\_FMT\_PAL8
format image file (like PNG images), possibly leading to the execution
of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GStreamer FFmpeg plugin users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-plugins/gst-plugins-ffmpeg-0.8.7-r1"
```
