      "other_details": "The provided content from Debian provides the following information about CVE-2005-4618:\n\nRoot cause: The sysctl functionality in the Linux kernel does not properly validate or enforce the size of a buffer.\n\nVulnerability:  Lack of proper buffer size enforcement when using sysctl.\n\nImpact: A successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\nAttack Vector: The vulnerability can be triggered through the use of sysctl functionality.\n\nAttacker Capabilities: An attacker needs to be able to interact with the sysctl interface, which typically requires local access to the system. This can also be done remotely, by using remote sysctl administration tools.\n\nThis vulnerability is also listed in the context of the advisory related to kernel 2.6.8. This indicates that there is an issue in both kernel 2.4.27 and 2.6.8, that was fixed by patching the kernel to version 2.4.27-10sarge2 and 2.6.8-16sarge2. This is more detailed information than the CVE description provided.",
