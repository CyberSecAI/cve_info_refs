  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A poorly-implemented feature in the PEAR installer allows a package to execute arbitrary PHP code when the 'pear' command is run or the Web/Gtk frontend is loaded.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Execution of arbitrary PHP code, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Installing a malicious package directly using the PEAR installer.",
      "Installing a package that depends on a malicious package."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create and publicly release a malicious package or compromise a legitimate package that is widely used. The user must then explicitly install this malicious package using the PEAR installer."
