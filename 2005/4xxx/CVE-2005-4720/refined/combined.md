The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

"malformed .html page" is pretty general. There are millions of them on the Web
that we don't segfault on. Could you attach an example of the HTML that we do
segfault on? (See "Create a New Attachment" above.)

this is a security bug will I be eligable for the bug bounty program?

The following attached file will cause firefox 1.0.6 on linux to sefault. This
file must be placed on a webserver in order to reproduce the crash.

It appears that this flaw is in fact exploitable. I was finally able to get a
debug version of firefox working.

Can someone host that attachment on a public web server in a way that allows
anyone to run under a debugger and see what's going wrong?
Confirming based on Tom's testimony and some correspondence with dveditz, which
started with Tom's mail to security@mozilla.org last week (Dan is at OSCON this
week, not sure where that correspondence left off). We need to diagnose this
and make some decisions, pronto.

Yes, and yes. We can use brute force to remove the attachment before making
the bug world-readable.
Dan Veditz remains your point of contact for this bug and any bounty issues, but
while he's out of town I think we need others to help here. Did you run under a
debugger and get a stack backtrace? If so, please attach it.

I have put the .html file up here:
<https://hak.us/firefox-death.html>
\_PLEASE KEEP IT PRIVATE\_
I have not disclosed this flaw to anyone else. Also, I am having problems
getting firefox src to compile on my mandrake box. Once I get it working, Ill
post the stack backtrace.

Did you try hitting it from the webserver? It doesnt seem to work when just
doing a File --> Open. Also, I noticed your running on Mac OS X. I have not
tried it on Mac OS X.

./run-mozilla.sh -g -d `which sh`
then use valgrind --help to figure out how to properly pick the right tool i

I've had no luck getting this to crash. Did you ever get a crash with a
stacktrace? Does our official release crash? If so you could make sure Talkback
is installed and just give us a talkback number.
If you simplify the testcase does it still crash for you? Is it just one of the
junk attributes that causes the problem, or do you need a combination to confuse
Firefox. A stack trace or talkback report would quite probably point us at the
problem attribute.
In mail to security@mozilla.org you mention a crash on a windows version that
looked like a null dereference. That was the most common result of the various
mangler-style crashes we've seen, though there were one or two that were
different and potentially exploitable. Is the linux crash also a null dereference?

No, this Linux issue seems to be a format string. I am not 100% sure though. I
find it amazing that \_noone\_ can get this to crash??~!~!? I am just running
1.0.6 linux version from the download site. Talkback is installed, but does not
popup after the crash because the browser just dies.

OK, so I managed to reproduce this with a 1.0.6 Firefox opt Linux build. I
can't reproduce with a debug build or even an opt -g build... In the build in
which I did reproduce, I get an infinite recursion stack overflow with the
following basic unit:

OK, so I've managed to reproduce in a "-Os -g" build. Apparently just building
completely without -Osomething makes the bug not happen... I see the same sort
of infinite recursion:
(gdb) frame 11
#11 0xb6dad556 in nsViewManager::SetWindowDimensions (this=0x82f8f60,
aWidth=466924892,

|  | |

So here's the problem, I think. The stack has:
(gdb) frame 19
#19 0xb6d4c162 in nsViewManager::SetWindowDimensions (this=0x0, aWidth=466901708,
aHeight=2100) at ../../../mozilla/view/src/nsViewManager.h:361
361 mRootView->SetDimensions(newDim);
(gdb) frame 17
#17 0xb7ad4532 in nsCommonWidget::Resize (this=0xb533ea18, aWidth=33350123,
aHeight=150,
aRepaint=1) at ../../../../mozilla/widget/src/gtk2/nsCommonWidget.cpp:319
319 DispatchResizeEvent(rect, status);
My p2t is 14. Note that 14 \* 33350123 == 466901722 (not 466901708). So when
the widget resizes and notifies the viewmanager, we end up back in
nsView::SetDimensions with a new width, 14 twips bigger. Repeat ad infinitum.
Now I did some tests, and 466901708 is quite definitely an integral multiple of
14, and the quotient is 33350122 (not 33350123).
I'm not sure \_why\_ the optimizer is screwing us over here (again, without -O
there is no crash). I tried writing a simple program that duplicates what we do
here, which is (once you inline stuff):
PRInt32((float(466901708) \* 0.0714285746f) + 0.5f)
but that gives me the right results even compiled with optimization enabled...

One two other things:
1) If all the crashes involved are stack overflow (and that's the only kind I've
been able to reproduce), is this exploitable?
2) On trunk we explicitly don't resize the widget right then, so this issue
can't arise.

The other possibility to consider, of course, is that we had an overflow that
clobbered the stack...

Yeah. So in this case the iframe has width 33333333 and the t2p is 14 and we have:
(gdb) p 33333333 \* (float)(1/14.0) \* (float)14
$44 = 33333334.490116104
And so forth. Note that casting is actually very important here. That is:
(gdb) p (float)(33333333) \* (float)(1/14.0) \* (float)14
$47 = 33333333.49011606
because
(gdb) p (float)(33333333)
$48 = 33333332
Also note:
(gdb) p 1/14.0
$49 = 0.071428571428571425
(gdb) p (float)(1/14.0)
$51 = 0.0714285746
So the basic problems are:
1) 1/14 cannot be represented very well in a float; the error is on the order
of 3 parts in 10^6.
2) 33333333 cannot be represented in a float either; it becomes 33333333 when cast.

When I compile this with 'g++ test.cpp' I get:
33350124
0
33350122

If I compile with 'g++ -O test.cpp' I get:
33350122

33350122
Real test: 33333334.000000
If I cast aTwips to double instead of float in NSTwipsToIntPixels, I get the
33350124 result no matter what. So this seems like an inlining issue of some
sort.
If I multiply by float(1/14.0) first (before multiplying by float(14.0)) I get
33333336.000000.

So summary: This is a stack overflow. I don't know whether those are
exploitable in general or not; dveditz, jruderman would have to comment on that.
There's no clear way to fix this given our use of equality testing here; even
switching to floats all over wouldn't help. :(

You are confusing stack buffer overflows, which may be used to overwrite return
addresses and direct control flow to code written by the attacker, with a stack
overflow, which causes the OS to kill the entire process -- at which point no
exploit is possible.

Right. This is not a buffer overflow. This is a "there are 700,000 function
calls on the stack and the kernel kills the process the next time a function
call is attempted" overflow.

As others have said, this is not an exploitable bug. A stack overflow can
either cause the system to get slow due to disk IO or to kill the process
(depends on memory, VM, and how much the OS will allow a stack to grow before
killing the process). The only systems where stack overflows are exploitable
are ones without memory protection. This can occur in some small devices like a
network processor or router with no MMU; that's not the case here.

bz: should this really block 1.0.8? It's non-exploitable, fixed in recent builds, and the widget caching patch ([bug 238493](/show_bug.cgi?id=238493 "RESOLVED FIXED - Need to (re)implement widget change caching")) might be a little more risk than we want in 1.0.x

Otherwise it doesn't really matter too much.

Nope. I set that nomination flag back when we still didn't know what was going on here. We definitely do not want widget caching on the 1.7 branch.Flags: blocking1.7.13?Flags: blocking-aviary1.0.8?
