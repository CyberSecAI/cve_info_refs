  "CVE-2005-4872": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in pcre_compile function when calculating the size of data block needed for compiling a regular expression.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow leading to a heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Compromise of processes using pcre to parse untrusted regex patterns. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
     "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted regular expressions with large name counts or name sizes.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to supply a malicious regular expression to a vulnerable application using PCRE."
