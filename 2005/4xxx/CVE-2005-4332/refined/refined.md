  "CVE-2005-4332": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is present in Cisco Clean Access/Perfigo CleanMachines. Specifically, the `/admin/uploadclient.jsp` page lacks authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to upload files to the `/installer/windows` web-visible directory. Similar vulnerabilities exist in `apply_firmware_action.jsp` and `file.jsp`.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of authentication checks in several JSP files, specifically `/admin/uploadclient.jsp`, `apply_firmware_action.jsp`, and `file.jsp`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing authentication for upload functionality",
      "Web-visible directory used for uploads without access control",
       "Inadequate file system partitioning"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (DoS). An attacker can upload files, potentially filling up the disk and causing the system to lock up. Additionally, the ability to upload files to a web-accessible directory poses further security risks.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote, unauthenticated access to vulnerable JSP pages.",
    "Required capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are needed, as the vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication."
