  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "seclists.org_d2a3b40a_20250124_161305.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a weakness in how `poppassd` handles the `-t` parameter, allowing a malicious user to specify a configuration file that is then loaded, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure handling of configuration file path provided by user",
        "Ability to inject and execute arbitrary code via shared library preloading"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root privileges on the target system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the system",
        "Command line argument injection via the `-t` parameter of the `poppassd` executable"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
          "Ability to execute programs on the local system",
          "Ability to create/modify files"
      ],
       "additional_information": "The exploit works by creating a shared library containing malicious code that executes when loaded, then leveraging the `poppassd` `-t` option to load the malicious library via a specially crafted configuration file. This method uses either `/etc/ld.so.preload` on Linux or `/etc/libmap.conf` on FreeBSD."
