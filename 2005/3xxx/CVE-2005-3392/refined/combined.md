* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Eric Romang discovered a local Denial of Service vulnerability in the

handling of the 'session.save\_path' parameter in PHP's Apache 2.0

module. By setting this parameter to an invalid value in an .htaccess

file, a local user could crash the Apache server. ([CVE-2005-3319](/security/CVE-2005-3319))

A Denial of Service flaw was found in the EXIF module. By sending an

image with specially crafted EXIF data to a PHP program that

automatically evaluates them (e. g. a web gallery), a remote attacker

could cause an infinite recursion in the PHP interpreter, which caused

the web server to crash. ([CVE-2005-3353](/security/CVE-2005-3353))

Stefan Esser reported a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in the

phpinfo() function. By tricking a user into retrieving a specially

crafted URL to a PHP page that exposes phpinfo(), a remote attacker

could inject arbitrary HTML or web script into the output page and

possibly steal private data like cookies or session identifiers.

([CVE-2005-3388](/security/CVE-2005-3388))

Stefan Esser discovered a vulnerability of the parse\_str() function

when it is called with just one argument. By calling such programs

with specially crafted parameters, a remote attacker could enable the

'register\_globals' option which is normally turned off for security

reasons. Once this option is enabled, the remote attacker could

exploit other security flaws of PHP programs which are normally

protected by 'register\_globals' being deactivated. ([CVE-2005-3389](/security/CVE-2005-3389))

Stefan Esser discovered that a remote attacker could overwrite the

$GLOBALS array in PHP programs that allow file uploads and run with

'register\_globals' enabled. Depending on the particular application,

this can lead to unexpected vulnerabilities. ([CVE-2005-3390](/security/CVE-2005-3390))

The 'gd' image processing and cURL modules did not properly check

processed file names against the 'open\_basedir' and 'safe\_mode'

restrictions, which could be exploited to circumvent these

limitations. ([CVE-2005-3391](/security/CVE-2005-3391))

Another bypass of the 'open\_basedir' and 'safe\_mode' restrictions was

found in virtual() function. A local attacker could exploit this to

circumvent these restrictions with specially crafted PHP INI files

when virtual Apache 2.0 hosts are used. ([CVE-2005-3392](/security/CVE-2005-3392))

The mb\_send\_mail() function did not properly check its arguments for

invalid embedded line breaks. By setting the 'To:' field of an email

to a specially crafted value in a PHP web mail application, a remote

attacker could inject arbitrary headers into the sent email.

([CVE-2005-3883](/security/CVE-2005-3883))

# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200511-08**

PHP suffers from multiple issues, resulting in security functions bypass,
local Denial of service, cross-site scripting or PHP variables overwrite.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-php/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.0-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **4.3.11-r4**>= **4.4.0-r4** |

| Package | **dev-php/mod\_php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.0-r8** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **4.3.11-r4**>= **4.4.0-r8** |

| Package | **dev-php/php-cgi** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.0-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **4.3.11-r5**>= **4.4.0-r5** |

### Background

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language widely used to develop
web-based applications. It can run inside a web server using the
mod\_php module or the CGI version and also stand-alone in a CLI.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found and fixed in PHP:

* a possible $GLOBALS variable overwrite problem through file
  upload handling, extract() and import\_request\_variables()
  (CVE-2005-3390)
* a local Denial of Service through the use of
  the session.save\_path option (CVE-2005-3319)
* an issue with
  trailing slashes in allowed basedirs (CVE-2005-3054)
* an issue
  with calling virtual() on Apache 2, allowing to bypass safe\_mode and
  open\_basedir restrictions (CVE-2005-3392)
* a problem when a
  request was terminated due to memory\_limit constraints during certain
  parse\_str() calls (CVE-2005-3389)
* The curl and gd modules
  allowed to bypass the safe mode open\_basedir restrictions
  (CVE-2005-3391)
* a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
  phpinfo() (CVE-2005-3388)

### Impact

Attackers could leverage these issues to exploit applications that
are assumed to be secure through the use of proper register\_globals,
safe\_mode or open\_basedir parameters. Remote attackers could also
conduct cross-site scripting attacks if a page calling phpinfo() was
available. Finally, a local attacker could cause a local Denial of
Service using malicious session.save\_path options.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround that would solve all issues at this
time.

### Resolution

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/php
```

All mod\_php users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/mod_php
```

All php-cgi users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/php-cgi
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# PHP 4.4.1. Release Announcement

The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate release of
[PHP 4.4.1](/downloads.php).

This is a bug fix release, which addresses some security problems too. The
security issues that this release fixes are:

* Fixed a Cross Site Scripting ([XSS](http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml))
  vulnerability in [phpinfo](/phpinfo)() that could
  lead f.e. to cookie exposure, when a phpinfo() script is accidently left
  on a production server.
* Fixed multiple safe\_mode/open\_basedir bypass vulnerabilities in ext/curl
  and ext/gd that could lead to exposure of files normally not accessible due
  to safe\_mode or open\_basedir restrictions.
* Fixed a possible $GLOBALS overwrite problem in file upload handling,
  extract() and import\_request\_variables() that could lead to unexpected
  security holes in scripts assumed secure. (For more information, see [here](http://www.hardened-php.net/globals-problem)).
* Fixed a problem when a request was terminated due to memory\_limit
  constraints during certain
  [parse\_str](/parse_str)() calls. In some cases
  this can result in register\_globals being turned on.
* Fixed an issue with trailing slashes in allowed basedirs. They were ignored
  by open\_basedir checks, so that specified basedirs were handled as prefixes
  and not as full directory names.
* Fixed an issue with calling [virtual](/virtual)()
  on Apache 2. This allowed bypassing of certain configuration directives
  like safe\_mode or open\_basedir.
* Updated to the latest pcrelib to fix a possible integer overflow
  vulnerability announced in [CAN-2005-2491](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2491).

This release also fixes 35 other defects, where the most important is the
the fix that removes a notice when passing a by-reference result of a function
as a by-reference value to another function. (Bug #[33558](http://bugs.php.net/33558)).

For a full list of changes in PHP 4.4.1, see the
[ChangeLog](/ChangeLog-4.php#4.4.1).
