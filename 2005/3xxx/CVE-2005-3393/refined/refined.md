    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A format string vulnerability exists in the `foreign_option()` function within `options.c`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Format string vulnerability.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the OpenVPN client by pushing a malicious `dhcp-option` through a compromised server.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious OpenVPN server can push a crafted `dhcp-option` string to a connecting client.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or compromise an OpenVPN server that a victim client connects to. The attacker also needs to successfully authenticate with the client."

    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The OpenVPN server may dereference a NULL pointer under specific error conditions when running in TCP mode.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending specific packets to an OpenVPN server running in TCP mode, leading to a crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending specific packets to an OpenVPN server running in TCP mode.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and needs to send packets to the vulnerable server."
