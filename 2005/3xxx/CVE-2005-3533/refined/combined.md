Debian Security Advisory DSA 918-1                     security@debian.org

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : osh
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-3347 CVE-2005-3533
Debian Bug     : 338312

Several security related problems have been discovered in osh, the
operator's shell for executing defined programs in a privileged
environment.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2005-3347

    Charles Stevenson discovered a bug in the substitution of
    variables that allows a local attacker to open a root shell.

CVE-2005-3533

    Solar Eclipse discovered a buffer overflow caused by the current
    working directory plus a filename that could be used to execute
    arbitrary code and e.g. open a root shell.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7-11woody2.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7-13sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7-15, however, the package has been removed entirely.

We recommend that you upgrade your osh package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
