  "CVE-2005-3137": {
    "Description": "The provided documents primarily discuss CVE-2005-2960, but one document mentions that CVE-2005-3137 is related to the same vulnerability.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure temporary file handling in cfengine and cfengine2 scripts.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the way cfengine and cfengine2 create and use temporary files. Specifically, the programs use predictable filenames and store temporary files in a shared directory (/tmp), making them vulnerable to symlink attacks.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability with a symlink attack to overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the cfengine program (often root), potentially leading to privilege escalation or system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local symlink attack.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a local user with the ability to create symlinks and must be able to execute cfengine or cfengine2 scripts indirectly or directly."
