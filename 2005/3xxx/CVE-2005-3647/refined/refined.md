Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in Folder Guard's access control mechanism. It fails to properly restrict the execution of executable files from the "Temporary Internet Files" directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is an insufficient access control mechanism for executable files. Specifically, the software does not prevent execution of files from temporary internet folders even though it is configured to restrict the execution of other local executables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could bypass the folder protection mechanism put in place by Folder Guard by placing/executing malicious executables from the Temporary Internet Files directory. This allows for running unauthorized programs.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local access. An attacker needs to have access to the system to place/run executable files in the Temporary Internet Files directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs local access to the system with Folder Guard installed and configured to restrict executable file execution. The attacker can install or execute files in the Temporary Internet Files directory.
