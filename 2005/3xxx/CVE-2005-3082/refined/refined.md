Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `admin.php` script of SEO-Board v1.02, where user authentication is performed using data from a cookie. The script extracts user ID and password hash from the cookie, and then uses this data in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is the lack of input sanitization when processing the `user_id` extracted from the cookie. The script directly embeds the unsanitized `user_id` into a SQL query.
    ```php
    $result = mysql_query("SELECT user_name FROM {$dbpref}users WHERE user_id='$user_id' AND user_pass='$user_pass_sha1'");
    ```
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The script relies on a cookie for authentication, making it vulnerable to manipulation by the attacker.
*   **Insecure Unserialization:** The cookie is unserialized using `unserialize(stripslashes($_COOKIE[$cookiename]))`, which can be a security risk if the cookie data is attacker-controlled, although this is not the primary vulnerability being exploited here.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Administrative Privilege Escalation:** By injecting malicious SQL code into the `user_id` field of the cookie, an attacker can bypass authentication checks. This grants them administrative privileges, allowing them to potentially manipulate the forum, access sensitive information, or perform other administrative actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious cookie that contains a specially crafted `user_id`. This modified cookie would be sent to the vulnerable script.
*   The attacker needs to understand the cookie structure for manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to set cookies:** The attacker needs to be able to set cookies on the victim's browser or use a tool to inject a malicious cookie.
*   **Basic knowledge of SQL and web requests:** The attacker needs to know how to construct SQL injection payloads and how to manipulate cookies.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided code snippet shows the vulnerable part of the `admin.php` script.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.03 of SEO-Board.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by RST/GHC.
*   The forum post provides a good amount of context regarding the SQL injection vulnerability.

This analysis provides detailed information about the SQL injection vulnerability in SEO-Board version 1.02 and it's more descriptive than what is typically found in the CVE description itself.
