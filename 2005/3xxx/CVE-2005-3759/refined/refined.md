Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the MIME viewers of the Horde Application Framework. Specifically, the CSS and tgz MIME drivers are affected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is that error messages generated by the MIME viewers are not properly escaped. This allows for the injection of malicious code into the user's browser when viewing specially crafted content, like emails, or through manipulated URLs.
- **Missing Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize user-controlled input before displaying it, leading to the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the victim's browser.
- **Compromise of Browser Content:** Successful exploitation can lead to a compromise of the user's browser content, potentially including:
    - Stealing user's identity information
    - Taking over user's sessions
    - Changing user's settings
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** This vulnerability could be leveraged as a starting point for more severe attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted emails:** Attackers can embed malicious code within emails that are then processed by Horde's webmail client (IMP) using the vulnerable MIME drivers.
- **Manipulated URLs:**  A specially crafted URL could also be used to trigger the vulnerable code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted email or entice a user to open a URL that will trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need access to the vulnerable system and can perform a remote attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Horde versions prior to 3.0.7.
- Patches were provided for the `tgz.php` and `css.php` files.
- A workaround exists by disabling the vulnerable MIME drivers.

**Summary of CVE-2005-3759**

The provided documents all relate to CVE-2005-3759. This CVE identifies a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Horde Application Framework. The lack of proper input sanitization in Horde's MIME viewers allows attackers to inject malicious scripts by sending specially crafted emails or through manipulated URLs. This could lead to compromised browser content, including stolen credentials and hijacked user sessions. The vulnerability affected versions prior to 3.0.7, and a patch was provided to resolve it.
