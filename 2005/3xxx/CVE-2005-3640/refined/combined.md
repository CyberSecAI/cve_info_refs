How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Luca Ercoli

IT Security Specialist

### About Me

Currently living in a quiet town near the Italian coast, I work as Cyber Security Specialist employed by one of the largest hosting provider of the country.

During the course of my career, researching for new techniques and issues on the wider field of InfoSec, hence vulnerabilities that affects Operating Systems, Web Application Security, Penetration Testing, Reverse Engeenering, Malware Analisys and Digital Forensics, I was been acknowledged for reporting security flaws affected by widely recognized companies like IBM, Apache Foundation, MySQL and Microsoft.

Demonstrable experience approved by [Harvard's Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning](https://harvardx.credential.getsmarter.com/usj2pv2r?key=532b83ba11193efba714fc6a6b127e7d36f372bc13df7ff57e8885d19ee6db38), 3 Cisco certifications, develop and organization of 3 Ethical Hacking national level competitions, 20 security advisories and 2 books published.

Proud to have achieved the third position in the World Ranking for the years 2022 and 2023 in the 'OWASP Injection' category at HackerOne, the world's largest community of trusted ethical hackers.

My background includes project leading, design and implementation, system libraries and Linux Kernel modules programming, iOS mobile game development, studies of Search Engine Optimization and experience in design and implementation of communication systems using SDR technology.

In my leisure time enjoys building stuff with 3D printer and home made Milling Machines, prototyping projects and little inventions etching circuits or using Arduino platform, playing the piano and watching documentaries.
