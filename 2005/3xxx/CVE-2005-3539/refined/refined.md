Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-3539:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The HylaFAX `notify` script and `faxrcvd` scripts were vulnerable due to the use of `eval` with unsanitized user-supplied data. Specifically, the scripts were not properly escaping or sanitizing input received from users when constructing strings for evaluation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Command Injection via notify script**:
    *   The `notify` script used `eval` to process user-provided data, specifically phone numbers or other data passed via sendfax. An attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands by embedding backticks, `$(...)`, or other shell metacharacters within the data, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running HylaFAX (typically `uucp`).
2. **Command Injection via faxrcvd script**:
    * The `faxrcvd` script also uses `eval` to process the CallID information. An attacker can similarly inject malicious code using specially crafted CallID data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allowed attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the HylaFAX server, with the privileges of the user running the HylaFAX service (usually `uucp`).
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** If the `uucp` user has more privileges, an attacker could further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`notify` Script**: Attackers could exploit the vulnerability through the `sendfax` command by manipulating the phone number or other data fields using command substitution.
*   **`faxrcvd` Script**: Attackers could exploit the `faxrcvd` script by sending a fax with a specially crafted CallID that contains malicious shell code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Submit Jobs/Send Faxes:** An attacker needed the ability to submit jobs to the HylaFAX server (e.g., via `sendfax` or sending a fax)
*  **For `faxrcvd`**: An attacker needs to be able to send a fax with a malicious CallID.
*   **Network Connectivity:**  An attacker would need some form of network access to the HylaFAX server, possibly indirectly via email gateways.
*   **No direct authentication required** if the system was configured to allow user logins without a password when PAM was disabled (as referenced in the discussion of related bug, CVE-2005-3538). Although, this is a separate issue, it is mentioned to have raised the severity.

**Additional Details from the Bug Report:**

*   The vulnerability was identified and patched by Patrice Fournier.
*   Patches involved escaping or sanitizing input before passing it to `eval`.
*   The initial fix for the notify script involved using single quotes for `eval` parameters and escaping such quotes in the content.
*   The fix for the faxrcvd script involved assigning the CallID variable and then expanding the variable using eval.
*   Later the faxrcvd fix was simplified to directly assign the input into the evaled string.

**Summary:**

CVE-2005-3539 details a command injection vulnerability in HylaFAX where user-supplied data, when processed by `notify` and `faxrcvd` scripts through `eval` without proper sanitization, allowed for arbitrary code execution. This could be triggered by users with the ability to send faxes or submit jobs, making it a serious security concern.
