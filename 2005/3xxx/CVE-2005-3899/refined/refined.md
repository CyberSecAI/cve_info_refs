- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Google Talk's automatic update mechanism fetches a version check file from `dl.google.com`. This mechanism does not properly validate the size of the downloaded executable, allowing an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of size validation on downloaded update files.
    - Reliance on DNS resolution for update server location.
    - Downloaded files are stored in a temporary location before verification.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of service (DoS) due to excessive CPU and memory consumption.
    - Potential for planting incriminating files in temporary storage.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - DNS poisoning to redirect Google Talk's update requests to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to poison a user's DNS cache.
    - Ability to host a malicious file at the location that is resolved by the poisoned DNS.
