How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Success Stories

[SIEVERS-GROUP](https://otrs.com/success-stories/sievers-group/)

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/sievers-group/)

The challenge

Continuous improvement is the credo of the SIEVERS-GROUP: support should be more efficient and of a higher quality for customers. It also strives to optimize the services and products provided. In order to be able to control these factors in a targeted manner, the relevant KPIs (key performance indicators) first had to be made visible and measurable.

1.200 tickets per month

90 agents

The solution

This has now been achieved. “With the help of OTRS, we were able to model and implement standardized processes for ticket processing throughout the company,” reports Henrik Kindt. This results in two key advantages: First, thanks to OTRS, it is possible to communicate with customers much more transparently and efficiently. Secondly, by measuring relevant KPIs, the SIEVERS-GROUP is able to monitor its service quality in a targeted manner and improve it immediately if necessary.

Solution[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[DLRG](https://otrs.com/success-stories/dlrg/)

With OTRS as our central helpdesk solution, we can respond quickly to inquiries and offer our volunteers a first-class service.

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/dlrg/)

The challenge

The DLRG teams are spread across Germany. They need fast IT service and use a variety of hardware.

2,000 tickets per month

126 agents

The solution

With OTRS as a central software solution, those responsible can improve IT service delivery through excellent organization and quick request processing.

Solution[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[H. Gautzsch Group](https://otrs.com/success-stories/h-gautzsch-group/)

The customization options were important in our decision for OTRS. The price-performance ratio then tipped the scales.

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/h-gautzsch-group/)

The Challenge

Sales teams did not have a sufficient overview of customer inquiries and processes, sometimes duplicating work.

7000 tickets per month

30 agents

The Solution

OTRS provides an organized overview of all processes and their processing status, and it has noticeably increased efficiency.

Solution[Customer Service & Support](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/customer-service-support/)[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[ALPHA COM](https://otrs.com/success-stories/alpha-com/)

Optimally structured communication and efficient support for greater customer and employee satisfaction at ALPHA COM Deutschland GmbH with OTRS

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/alpha-com/)

The Challenge

The ITSM solution used until 2017 was technologically insufficient as a support solution. It lacked transparency, led to communication outside the tool, and employees who were dissatisfied with the interface.

2,000 tickets per month

50 agents

The Solution

High transparency in inquiry handling, efficient escalation processes and structured communication – the use of OTRS leads to increased service quality and satisfied employees and customers.

Solution[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[MET Group](https://otrs.com/success-stories/met-group/)

Switching from ((OTRS)) Community Edition to the OTRS enterprise help desk solution improves CSAT and enables proactivity at a great value

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/met-group/)

The Challenge

The company was growing. It was time to evolve – from an open source ticketing system to an enterprise help desk solution – in order to better meet the growing needs of customers, management and IT.

1,000+ tickets per month

12 agents

The Solution

The customizable OTRS help desk solution was selected and support was added.

Package        : otrs
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-3893 CVE-2005-3894 CVE-2005-3895
BugTraq ID     : 15537
Debian Bug     : 340352

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in otrs, the Open Ticket
Request System, that can be exploited remotely.  The Common
vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2005-3893

    Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary SQL commands and bypass authentication.

CVE-2005-3894

    Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allow remote
    authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2005-3895

    Internally attached text/html mails are rendered as HTML when the
    queue moderator attempts to download the attachment, which allows
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary web script or HTML.

the old stable distribution (woody) does not contain OTRS packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.2p01-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.4p01-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your otrs package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

AFFECTED APPLICATION OR SERVICE
  OTRS
  <http://www.otrs.org/>

  OTRS, the Open Source Ticket Request System, is a trouble
  ticket system which allows for managing customer telephone
  calls and e-mails.

AFFECTED VERSIONS
  Version 2.0.0 up to and including 2.0.3 and OTRS 1.0.0 up
  to and including 1.3.2.

ISSUES
  OTRS is subject to multiple security vulnerabilities,
  ranging from cross site scripting to SQL injection.

  >>> 1. SQL injection #1
  A malicious user may be able to conduct blind SQL code
  injection on the OTRS 'Login' function. Successful
  authentication is NOT required. By injecting a LEFT JOIN
  statement into the authentication database SQL query,
  an attacker may be able to exploit this issue.

  The following partial URL demonstrates this issue:
  [OTRS_BaseURI]/index.pl?Action=Login&User=%27[SQL_HERE]

  This results in an SQL error message being logged in the
  OTRS system log.

  >>> 2. SQL injection #2
  A malicious user may be able to conduct blind SQL code
  injection on the OTRS 'AgentTicketPlain' function in the
  'TicketID' parameter. Successful authentication IS required,
  however, a non-authenticated user will be prompted for her
  login credentials and the attack will still be carried out
  after the login succeeded. By injecting a LEFT JOIN statement
  into the SQL query, an attacker may be able to exploit this
  issue.

  The following partial URL demonstrates this issue:

[OTRS_BaseURI]/admin/index.pl?Action=AgentTicketPlain&ArticleID=1&TicketID=1%20[SQL_HERE]

  This results in an SQL error message being logged in the
  OTRS system log.

  >>> 3. SQL injection #3
  A malicious user may be able to conduct blind SQL code
  injection on the OTRS 'AgentTicketPlain' function in the
  'ArticleID' parameter. Successful authentication IS required,
  however, a non-authenticated user will be prompted for her
  login credentials and the attack will still be carried out
  after the login succeeded. By injecting a LEFT JOIN statement
  into the SQL query, an attacker may be able to exploit this
  issue.

  The following partial URL demonstrates this issue:

[OTRS_BaseURI]/admin/index.pl?Action=AgentTicketPlain&TicketID=1&ArticleID=1%20[SQL_HERE]

  This results in an SQL error message being logged in the
  OTRS system log.

  >>> 4. Cross Site Scripting #1
  OTRS is subject to a XSS vulnerability on the file attachment
  display function.

  An attacker may send malicious code inside an email attachment
  of Content-Type "text/html". A queue moderator clicking the
  attachment download button (disk symbol) on a ticket created
  based on a HTML email will have this attachment rendered by
  her browser. Thus, any malicious client side code included in
  the HTML attachment will be executed in the security context
  of the OTRS domain.

  This refers to the default configuration
  (AttachmentDownloadType = "inline") but does not apply if
  AttachmentDownloadType is set to "attachment".

  >>> 5. Cross Site Scripting #2
  OTRS is subject to a XSS vulnerability on the queue selection
  function.

  An attacker may inject arbitrary client side script code into
  the 'QueueID' parameter. Successful authentication IS required,
  however, a non-authenticated user will be prompted for her
  login credentials and the attack will still be carried out
  after the login succeeded.

  The following partial URL demonstrates this issue:

[OTRS_BaseURI]/index.pl?QueueID=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('[XSS_HERE]')%3B%3C/script%3E%3Cx%20y=%22

  >>> 6. Cross Site Scripting #3
  OTRS is subject to a XSS vulnerability on the 'Action'
  parameter. An attacker may inject arbitrary client side script
  code into this parameter. To exploit this issue, successful
  authentication IS required, however, a non-authenticated user
  will be prompted for her login credentials and the attack will
  still be carried out after the login succeeded.

  The following partial URL demonstrates this issue:

[OTRS_BaseURI]/index.pl?Action="><script>alert(document.title);</script><x%20"

  This is only exploitable on web browsers which perform limited
  URL encoding before submitting user input, such as Internet
  Explorer (tested on v6.2900.2180 including all patches on
  Windows XP SP2) and Konqueror (tested on V3.3.2).

BACKGROUND
  SQL Injection:
  SQL injection describes the inclusion of additional SQL
  database query language statements into an existing query as
  carried out by a web application. A common attack vector is
  the injection of user-supplied arbitrary SQL statements into
  the applications' databse queries. Failure to completely
  sanitize user input from malicious content can cause a web
  application to be vulnerable to SQL Injection.

  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection>
  <http://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/sql.shtml>

  Cross Site Scripting (XSS):
  Cross Site Scripting, also known as XSS or CSS, describes
  the injection of malicious content into output produced
  by a web application. A common attack vector is the
  inclusion of arbitrary client side script code into the
  applications' output. Failure to completely sanitize user
  input from malicious content can cause a web application
  to be vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting.

  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSS>
  <http://www.cgisecurity.net/articles/xss-faq.shtml>

WORKAROUNDS
  Issues 1-3:
    Client: Disable Javascript.
    Server: Prevent access to vulnerable file(s).
  Issue 4:
    Client: Right-click on disk logo and select to download
            to file ('save as').
    Server: Change configuration to force file download.
            Admin interface -> SysConfig -> Framework
            -> Core::Web -> AttachmentDownloadType
            -> "attachment".
  Issues 5-6:
    Client: N/A
    Server: Prevent access to vulnerable file(s).

SOLUTIONS
  OTRS has released versions 2.0.4 and 1.3.3 today. These are
  supposed to fix all of the above issues. The updated
  packages are available at ftp://ftp.otrs.org/pub/otrs/
