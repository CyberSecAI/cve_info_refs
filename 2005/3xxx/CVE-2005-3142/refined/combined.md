Date
October 3, 2005

Vulnerability
The Kaspersky Antivirus Library provides file format support for virus analysis. \
During analysis of cab files Kaspersky is vulnerable to a heap overflow allowing \
attackers complete control of the system(s) being protected. This vulnerability can \
be exploited remotely without user interaction in default configurations through \
common protocols such as SMTP, SMB, HTTP, and FTP.

Impact
Successful exploitation of Kaspersky protected systems allows attackers unauthorized \
control of data and related privileges. It also provides leverage for further network \
compromise. Kaspersky Antivirus Library implementations are likely vulnerable in \
their default configuration.

Affected Products
Due to the library's OS independent design and core functionality: it is likely this \
vulnerability affects a substantial portion of Kaspersky's gateway, server, and \
client antivirus enabled product lines on most platforms.

<http://www.kaspersky.com/products>

Note: Kaspersky's antivirus OEM product line is a program where vendors may license \
the vulnerable library. The following link is a list containing some of the Kaspersky \
partners with products also likely affected by this vulnerability. Refer to your \
vendor for specifics.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
