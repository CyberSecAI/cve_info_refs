The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Gadu-Gadu instant messenger version 7.20 and earlier. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerability #1 (Image Sending):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows the sender to specify the file name when sending an image.
*   **Weakness:**  The application does not properly sanitize or validate the filename provided by the sender.
*  **Attack Vector:** A malicious user can send an image with a specially crafted filename.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Writing image content to special device files like 'LPT1:' (printer port), potentially causing unexpected system behavior.
    *   Sending multiple images named 'AUX:' can block the thread responsible for handling messages, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send images to the victim using the vulnerable Gadu-Gadu application.

**Vulnerability #2 (Image Sending):**

*   **Root Cause:**  A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when handling image filenames.
*   **Weakness:**  The application copies the received image filename to a fixed-size buffer on the stack, without checking if it exceeds the buffer size after concatenating "imgcache\".
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious user can send an image with a filename length between 192 and 200 characters, which, after concatenation, will cause the overflow.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The stack can be overwritten with attacker-controlled data, potentially leading to code execution, although this is difficult due to stack canaries.
    *   A DoS is more readily achievable by crashing the application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send images to the victim using the vulnerable Gadu-Gadu application.

**Vulnerability #1 (Direct Connections):**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of DCC packets over direct connections, initiated by CTCP packet.
*   **Weakness:**  The application allocates memory based on the size specified in the DCC packet even if the packet's code is not valid, but does not release it when the packet is dropped.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can send a series of DCC packets with invalid codes but large size values.
*   **Impact:**  Memory exhaustion leading to a DoS by exhausting available memory over repeated attempts.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a direct connection with the victim.

**Vulnerability #2 (Direct Connections):**

*   **Root Cause:** DCC packets with specific codes trigger error message popups.
*   **Weakness:** The error messages do not provide context about the source and each packet processing involves creating threads, and these threads may not be cleaned up if the user does not close the error message.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can flood the victim with DCC packets containing these specific codes without any prior communication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Annoying pop-up messages.
    *   A DoS by exhausting system resources (thread creation).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a direct connection with the victim.

**Vulnerability #1 (GG Moniker):**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of multiple "gg:" URI invocations.
*   **Weakness:** Multiple invocations can be triggered rapidly without restrictions.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious web page can contain multiple "gg:" URI references.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application crashes.
    *   Possible loss of configuration due to concurrent access issues.
    *   DoS
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make the victim browse a malicious webpage.

**Vulnerability #2 (GG Phonecalls):**

*   **Root Cause:**  The EasycallLite.oce ActiveX object can be instantiated from a web page without user consent.
*   **Weakness:** The EasycallLite.oce object can be used to make calls without user interaction or notification.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious web page can instantiate the EasycallLite.oce object and initiate a call to a number.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping on the user (if the user has a microphone).
*    **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make the victim browse a malicious webpage.
