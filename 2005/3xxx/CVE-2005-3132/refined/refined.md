      "details": {
        "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist within Merak Mail Server 8.2.4r with Icewarp Web Mail 5.5.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and insecure handling of file paths.",

          {
            "type": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
             "description": "Remote users without an account can inject and execute arbitrary scripts via vulnerable parameters in multiple HTML files like blank.html, calendar_d.html, calendar_m.html and calendar_w.html."

            "type": "PHP Inclusion",
            "description": "Remote users can view and download arbitrary files or execute PHP code with webmail privileges by manipulating the `helpid` parameter in help.html, leveraging directory traversal and null byte injection. This allows attackers to potentially access sensitive files like `users.dat` to gain control of the mail server and the system if running under administrator account."

         "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, and complete control of the mail server and the affected system.",
        "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the web interface of the Merak Mail Server. No prior authentication is required. Only a web browser is needed for exploitation.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need an account on the mail server. They can be remote and only require a web browser."
