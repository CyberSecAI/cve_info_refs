Updated kernel packages available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Update
4
(RHSA-2006-0575)

Original Release Date: October 12, 2006

Last Revised: October 12, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-200

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update as
reported
by Red Hat:

* A flaw in the USB devio handling of device removal that allowed
  a
  local user to cause a denial of service (crash).
* A flaw in the ACL handling of nfsd that allowed a remote user to
  bypass ACLs
  for readonly mounted NFS file systems.
* A flaw in the netfilter handling that allowed a local user with
  CAP\_NET\_ADMIN rights to cause a buffer overflow.
* A flaw in the IBM S/390 and IBM zSeries strnlen\_user() function that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or to retrieve
  random kernel data.
* A flaw in the keyctl functions that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial of service (crash) or to read sensitive kernel memory
* A flaw in unaligned accesses handling on Itanium processors that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash)
* A flaw in SELinux ptrace logic that allowed a local user with ptrace
  permissions to change the tracer SID to a SID of another process
* An info leak on AMD-based x86 and x86\_64 systems that allowed a
  local
  user to retrieve the floating point exception state of a process run by
  a
  different user.
* A flaw in IPv4 packet output handling that allowed a remote user to
  bypass the zero IP ID countermeasure on systems with a disabled
  firewall.
* A minor info leak in socket option handling in the network code.
* A flaw in the HB-ACK chunk handling of SCTP that allowed a remote
  user to
  cause a denial of service (crash).
* A flaw in the SCTP implementation that allowed a remote user to
  cause a
  denial of service (deadlock).
* A flaw in the socket buffer handling that allowed a remote user to
  cause
  a denial of service (panic).
* A flaw in the signal handling access checking on PowerPC that
  allowed a
  local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or read arbitrary kernel
  memory on 64-bit systems.
* A flaw in the netfilter SCTP module when receiving a chunkless
  packet
  that allowed a remote user to cause a denial of service (crash).
* There were several bug fixes in various parts of the kernel. The
  ongoing
  effort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement
  in the reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

## 2. Avaya System Products with affected Kernels installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 1.x to CM 3.x | Low | See recommended actions below. This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 3.0 and greater | Low | See recommended actions below. This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the Linux Kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict
local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and
can be
installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems. Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the
underlying operating system or applications that come with the operating
system. These vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only
product directly but may threaten the integrity of the underlying
platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform
may be. Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

Hi!

I've been working on some userspace usb drivers in which I use the
asynchronous usb devio URB delivery to usrerspace.

There have always been some bug reports of kernel oopses while
terminating a program that uses the driver.

Now I found out a way to relatively easy trigger that oops from pcscd
(part of pcsc-lite) on any kernel, at least tested with 2.6.8 to 2.6.14-rc2.

Call Trace:

 [<c010551c>] do_IRQ+0x1c/0x30
 [<c010388a>] common_interrupt+0x1a/0x20

So what do we learn from that?  That usb_hcd_giveback_urb() is called
from in_interrupt() context and calls async_completed().

async_completed() calls send_sig_info(), which in turn does a
spin_lock(&tasklist_lock) to protect itself from task_struct->sighand
from going away.  However, the call to
"spin_lock_irqsave(task_struct->sighand->siglock)" causes an oops,
because "sighand" has disappeared.

If a process issues an URB from userspace and (starts to) terminate
before the URB comes back, we run into the issue described above.  This
is because the urb saves a pointer to "current" when it is posted to the
device, but there's no guarantee that this pointer is still valid
afterwards.

This basically means that any userspace process with permissions to
any arbitrary USB device can Ooops any kernel.(!)

In fact, there are two separate issues:

1) the pointer to "current" can become invalid, since the task could be
   completely gone when the URB completion comes back from the device.
   This can be fixed by get_task_struct() / put_task_struct().

2) Even if the saved task pointer is still pointing to a valid task_struct,
   task_struct->sighand could have gone meanwhile.  Therefore, the USB
   async URB completion handler needs to reliably check whether
   task_struct->sighand is still valid or not.  In order to prevent a
   race with __exit_sighand(), it needs to grab a
   read_lock(&tasklist_lock).  This strategy seems to work, since the
   send_sig_info() code uses the same protection.
   However, we now need to export a __send_sig_info() function, one that
   expects to be called with read_lock(&tasklist_lock) already held by
   the caller.  It's ugly, but I doubt there is a less invasive
   solution.

Expected FAQ's:

a) Q: But grabbing references to "current" and delivering URB completion
      via signals is totally invalid and broken in may ways !
   A: Yes, but dozens of userspace apps/drivers rely on this broken API.
      As long as there's no new, sane, usbdevio2, we cannot just rip it
      out without a replacement.

b) Q: Why can't wa use the normal SIGIO mechanism?
   A: Because the usbdevio API needs to pass a __user pointer to the URB
      along the delivered signal.

c) Q: If this is a local DoS, why did you post it publicly?
   A: Because I've already informed linux-usb-devel in May.

I suggest this (or any other) fix to be applied to both 2.6.14 final and
the stable series.  I didn't yet investigate 2.4.x, but I think it is
likely to have the same problem.

Cheers,

Updated kernel packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 8
(RHSA-2006-0437)

Original Release Date: September 15, 2006

Last Revised: September 15, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-180

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux
operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 3. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update
as
reported by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the USB devio handling of device removal that allowed
  a local
  user to cause a denial of service (crash)
* a flaw in the exec() handling of multi-threaded tasks using
  ptrace()
  that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (hang of
  a user
  process)
* a difference in "sysretq" operation of EM64T (as opposed to
  Opteron)
  processors that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service
  (crash)
  upon return from certain system calls
* a flaw in unaligned accesses handling on Intel Itanium
  processors that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash)
* an info leak on AMD-based x86 and x86\_64 systems that
  allowed a local
  user to retrieve the floating point exception state of a process
  run by a
  different user
* a flaw in IPv4 packet output handling that allowed a remote
  user to
  bypass the zero IP ID countermeasure on systems with a disabled
  firewall
* a minor info leak in socket option handling in the network
  code
* a flaw in IPv4 netfilter handling for the unlikely use of
  SNMP NAT
  processing that allowed a remote user to cause a denial of
  service (crash)
  or potential memory corruption

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has

security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0437.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with affected kernel packages installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | all versions of CM | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict
local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through
the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted networking practices until such time as an
update becomes
available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g.
RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
