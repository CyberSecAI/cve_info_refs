{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in various implementations of the ISAKMP/IKEv1 protocol, specifically in the IKEv1 Phase 1 negotiation process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflows",
      "Format string vulnerabilities",
      "Other unspecified vulnerabilities"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to:\n\t- Remote code execution\n\t- Denial of service (DoS)\n\t- Unstable/unpredictable behavior of the IKEv1 implementation\n\t- Access to sensitive information",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can send specially crafted packets to a vulnerable IKEv1 installation to exploit these vulnerabilities.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system implementing IKEv1."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerabilities were discovered using the PROTOS Test Tool.  The specific vulnerabilities include issues with 3DES key length handling which can cause a Denial of Service."
