{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux Orinoco driver pads Ethernet frames with uninitialized data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Leakage due to uninitialized memory being sent in Ethernet frames.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attacker can obtain parts of memory which may contain sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending ARP requests, an attacker can receive ARP replies containing uninitialized memory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to a vulnerable system. The attacker does not need any special privileges."
