Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "aspReady FAQ" application, which allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization, leading to the ability to manipulate the queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Admin Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain administrative access to the application.
- **Database Manipulation:** With admin access, the attacker can change or delete the entire database. This leads to complete compromise of the application's data and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface by injecting malicious SQL code via user input fields.
- A specific example of an SQL injection provided is `1'or'1'='1`, indicating that a single quote character is used to break out of a string context in the SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Web Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the web interface of the "aspReady FAQ" application.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** An understanding of SQL syntax and injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payloads.
- No authentication is specifically mentioned as a requirement, it may be possible to trigger this vulnerability without logging in.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported in October 2005.
- The report explicitly states that the vulnerability allows "admin access with the ability to change/delete the entire database."
- A live sample at www.itsikkerhet.com/db/faq was mentioned as an example for testing the vulnerability.
- The information provided is more detailed than the standard CVE description.
