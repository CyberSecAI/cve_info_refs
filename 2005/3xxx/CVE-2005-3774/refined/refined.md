Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3774:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Cisco PIX firewall fails to validate the TCP checksum of transiting TCP packets by default.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of TCP checksum validation in Cisco PIX firewall.
- The firewall does not verify the integrity of the TCP header before forwarding packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attack against PIX-protected systems.
- Legitimate connection attempts may be blocked for up to two minutes per attack, disrupting network access to services behind the firewall.
- Attackers can exhaust the firewall's resources by creating numerous embryonic connections.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending TCP SYN packets with malformed TCP checksums.
- Using spoofed source IP addresses and ports in the malicious TCP SYN packets.
- These malformed packets are sent to systems behind the affected PIX firewalls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker capable of sending spoofed TCP SYN packets to the target network protected by the Cisco PIX firewall.
- No authentication is required to perform this attack.
- The attacker needs the capability to create high volumes of packets with forged source IP addresses and checksums.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending TCP SYN packets with incorrect checksums to systems protected by the firewall, and the target system will drop the packets without sending back TCP RST packets which would remove the embryonic entry.
- The firewall creates embryonic connection entries for these spoofed packets, eventually blocking legitimate traffic due to resource exhaustion.
- This vulnerability affects only initial connection attempts and does not affect established TCP connections.
- Publicly available exploit code can automate the DoS attack.
- Cisco has provided workarounds, which can be found in the provided links.
