{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `internal_getgrouplist` function in glibc does not check if there is enough space in the provided buffer before adding the main group ID, potentially leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Stack corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Calling `getgrouplist` with `ngroups=0` to trigger the size calculation and then providing a smaller buffer than required for the main group ID.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code that calls the vulnerable `getgrouplist` function with specific parameters."
