| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=661#c0)  Thorsten Kukuk    2005-01-14 13:21:52 UTC  ``` If you call getgrouplist with ngroups=0 as argument to find out, how  big the buffer needs to be, it will corrupt the stack. The problem is,  that internal_getgrouplist will always add the main group at first,  without checking for enough space. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=661#c1)  Thorsten Kukuk    2005-01-14 13:23:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 352](attachment.cgi?id=352&action=diff "Patch to check for enough space") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=352&action=edit "Patch to check for enough space") Patch to check for enough space ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=661#c2)  Sourceware Commits    2005-03-29 23:40:07 UTC  ``` Subject: [Bug 661](show_bug.cgi?id=661 "RESOLVED FIXED - getgrouplist memory corruption (CVE-2005-3590)")  CVSROOT:	/cvs/glibc Module name:	libc Changes by:	roland@sources.redhat.com	2005-03-29 23:39:59  Modified files: 	grp            : initgroups.c   Log message: 	2005-03-29  Thorsten Kukuk  <kukuk@suse.de> 	 	[BZ #661] 	* grp/initgroups.c (internal_getgrouplist): Check if we have 	enough space before adding the primary group to the list.
