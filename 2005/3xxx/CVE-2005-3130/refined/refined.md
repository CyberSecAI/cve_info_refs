```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the login form. Specifically, the username field is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject SQL code.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - SQL Injection: Allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrative access.
    - Improper Input Validation: Failure to sanitize user inputs leads to SQL injection.
    - Remote Code Execution: Once authenticated as admin, the attacker can insert malicious PHP code into templates, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can gain complete control of the database and the server hosting the application. This includes the ability to modify data, execute arbitrary system commands and gain access to sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.
  - Attack vectors: The attack vector is via the login form by injecting malicious SQL code into the username field. Then editing the templates, attackers insert and activate malicious PHP code.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker only needs to access the login form of the vulnerable Lucid CMS instance.
