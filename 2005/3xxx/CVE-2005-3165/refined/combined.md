        3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information

______________________________________________________________________________

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities

   To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
   issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
   vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
   or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
   more severe vulnerabilities.

   Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
   server and via the YaST Online Update.

   - storeBackup insecure /tmp usage and permissions

     This update upgrades storeBackup to version 1.19 and fixes following
     security issues:
     - storeBackup used insecure /tmp filenames.
     - storeBackup used insecure (world readable) file permissions for
       the backup root.

     Only SUSE Linux retail products contain storeBackup and are affected.

   - squid remote denial of service problems

     The web proxy squid was updated to fix two remotely exploitable
     denial of service vulnerabilities. One can be triggered by aborting a
     request and the other one occurs in sslConnectTimeout while handling
     malformed requests.

     This is tracked by the Mitre CVE IDs CAN-2005-2794 and CAN-2005-2796.

     All SUSE Linux based products containing squid are affected.

   - mysql stack overflow in function handling

     This update fixes a stack-based buffer overflow in MySQL's init_syms
     function that can be exploited by authenticated users with the
     privilege to create user-defined functions.

     This is tracked by the Mitre CVE ID CAN-2005-2558.

     All SUSE Linux based products including mysql are affected.

   - util-linux umount privilege escalation

     The remount option of umount allowed local users to clear certain
     security relevant flags such as the nosuid flag.

     This is tracked by the Mitre CVE ID CAN-2005-2876. All SUSE Linux
     based products are affected by this problem.

   - OpenOffice_org version upgrade

     OpenOffice.org on SUSE Linux 9.3 was upgraded to 2.0 Beta Milestone m125.
     This includes a large number of bug fixes in all areas.

     This update also fixes a buffer overflow in the MS Word document
     reader. By creating a specially crafted Word document a remote
     attacker could exploit this bug to execute arbitrary code under
     the user id of the user viewing the document (CAN-2005-0941).

     Note that this version will save files in the new, final XML format
     that cannot be read by the original SUSE Linux 9.3 version.
     Files saved with the original 9.3 version can be read without problems.

   - Mediawiki cross site scripting problems

     More cross site scripting problems were found in MediaWiki. The
     problems fixed in the 1.4.9 release have been back ported and are
     included in this security update.
     Only SUSE Linux 9.3 contains MediaWiki.

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds

   None

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information

  - Announcement authenticity verification:

    SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
    sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
    guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
    security announcements are published with a valid signature.

    To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
    and run the command

      gpg --verify <file>

    replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
    The output for a valid signature looks like:

      gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
      gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"

    where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.

    If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
    import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
    command

      gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
    world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
    and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
    package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.

    The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
    authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command

      rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>

    to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
    filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
    contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.

    This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
    distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
    also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
    announcement.

    subscribe:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
