```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the scanning engine of multiple anti-virus programs. These engines incorrectly determine the file type based on the "magic byte" at the beginning of the file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The anti-virus software relies on the magic byte (e.g., "MZ" for EXE files) to determine the file type. By prepending an incorrect magic byte to a malicious file, the anti-virus software can be tricked into misidentifying the file type, thus bypassing detection. Specifically, prepending an "MZ" header to a .BAT, .HTML, or .EML file can cause the antivirus to treat it as an EXE and fail to scan it properly.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation leads to the evasion of anti-virus detection, allowing malicious files to bypass security measures. This can result in undetected malware infections, leading to data theft, system compromise, and other malicious activities.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector involves modifying a malicious file by prepending a forged magic byte (e.g., "MZ" for EXE files). This modified file is then used to bypass anti-virus detection.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to modify the malicious file and then deliver it to the target system. No special capabilities are needed aside from the ability to modify file headers.
