     Advisory: phpMyAdmin Local File Inclusion Vulnerability
 Release Date: 2005/10/22
Last Modified: 2005/10/22
       Author: Stefan Esser [sesser@hardened-php.net]

  Application: phpMyAdmin <= 2.6.4-pl2
     Severity: A design flaw within phpMyAdmin allows inclusion
               of arbitrary files, which usually leads to remote
    	       code execution
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
   References: <http://www.hardened-php.net/advisory_162005.73.html>

Overview:

   Quote from [www.phpmyadmin.net:](http://www.phpmyadmin.net:)
   "phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
   administration of MySQL over the Web. Currently it can create
   and drop databases, create/drop/alter tables, delete/edit/add
   fields, execute any SQL statement, manage keys on fields, manage
   privileges,export data into various formats and is available
   in 50 languages."

   And audit of phpMyAdmin revealed a design flaw in the way
   phpMyAdmin includes it's register_globals compatibility layer,
   that allows inclusion of arbitrary local files, which usually
   leads to remote code execution.

   *** NOTE: This vulnerability is not exploitable if you are
             running PHP with our Hardening-Patch applied

Details:

   phpMyAdmin comes with a register_globals emulation layer within
   grab_globals.php, to ensure compatibility with hosts where this
   feature is turned off. This file is usually included at the very
   beginning, so that globalizing the request variables does not
   overwrite already used script variables. When the _GET and _POST
   variables are extracted it is even ensured, that certain names
   cannot be overwritten. This safety checks are not in effect, when
   the _FILES array, which holds information about uploaded files,
   is merged into the global namespace.

   Unfortunately phpMyAdmin comes with a few files that were not meant
   to be called directly and that do not include grab_globals.php but
   common.lib.php in the beginning. This results f.e. in the following
   include tree:

      - db_details_db_info.php
      \___ libraries/common.lib.php
           \___ libraries/select_lang.lib.php
	   \   \___ libraries/grab_globals.php
	   \   \___ lang/a-language.inc.php
	   \___ ...

   From this one can see, that grab_globals.php will be included by
   select_lang.lib.php, if it is not included in the very beginning.
   This has the bad side effect, that the globalisation of the request
   variables is executed *after* common.lib.php has loaded the $cfg
   configuration array. In combination with the fact, that the _FILES
   array is not protected against keys with the name 'cfg', it is
   possible to overwrite the content of the configuration array in
   a way, that empties the content of the $cfg['ThemePath'] variable.
   This variable contains the path to a directory, that contains the
   supported themes. With the same overwrite it is possible to fill
   the variable $cfg['ThemeManager'] with a value, which evaluates to
   true.

   The idea behind this overwrite is to exploit an include statement
   which tries to verify the existance of a theme, selected through
   f.e. a supplied cookie variable:

   @include($cfg['ThemePath'].'/'.$GLOBALS['theme'].'/info.inc.php');

   Due to the fact, that $cgf['ThemePath'] is empty and the global
   variable theme is filled with the content of a user supplied
   cookie, it is possible to use either a %00 or a realpath()
   truncation attack on the include filename to include any file,
   that can be accessed by the webserver.

   At this point a few things have to be noted:

      1) When reading the theme name from the cookie directory the
         value is sanitizied against directory traversal attacks
	 by removing .. from the filename. However the attack
	 described here results in an absolute filepath beeing
	 included, therefore any protection against directory
	 traversal attacks is worthless.

      2) A %00 filename truncation attack will only work if
         magic_quotes_gpc is turned off, which is however the
	 recommended setting. A realpath() truncation attack on
	 the other hand will only work agains malfunctional
	 realpath() implementation, which can be found in f.e.
	 older OpenBSD versions.

      3) This vulnerability *cannot* be exploited, when your server
         uses our PHP Hardening-Patch, because it has a build in
	 protection against such include-filename truncation
	 attacks.

Proof of Concept:

   The Hardened-PHP project is not going to release exploits for
   this vulnerability to the public.

Disclosure Timeline:

   15. October 2005 - Contacted phpMyAdmin developers by email
   21. October 2005 - Vendor notifies me about planned release
   22. October 2005 - Release of new phpMyAdmin version
   22. October 2005 - Public Disclosure

Recommendation:

   It is strongly recommended to upgrade to the new version of
   phpMyAdmin which you can download at:

Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-2869 CVE-2005-3300 CVE-2005-3301
BugTraq ID     : 15169
Debian Bug     : 328501 335306 335513

Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
phpmyadmin, a set of PHP-scripts to administrate MySQL over the WWW.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CAN-2005-2869

    Andreas Kerber and Michal Cihar discovered several cross-site
    scripting vulnerabilities in the error page and in the cookie
    login.

CVE-2005-3300

    Stefan Esser discovered missing safety checks in grab_globals.php
    that could allow an attacker to induce phpmyadmin to include an
    arbitrary local file.

CVE-2005-3301

    Tobias Klein discovered several cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to inject arbitrary
    HTML or client-side scripting.

The version in the old stable distribution (woody) has probably its
own flaws and is not easily fixable without a full audit and patch
session.  The easier way is to upgrade it from woody to sarge.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2-3sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.4-pl1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 alias sarge

## PMASA-2005-5

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2005-5

**Date:** 2005-10-22

**Updated:** 2005-10-25

### Summary

(1) Local file inclusion vulnerability and (2) Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability

### Description

We received a security advisory from Stefan Esser (sesser@hardened-php.net) about (1). We received a security advisory from Tobias Klein (tk@trapkit.de) about (2). We wish to thank both of them for their work.

(1) : Due to the sequence of execution in the code that gets form parameters in some scripts, it was possible to craft a special attack form that overwrites configuration parameters.

(2) : Some scripts were vulnerable to XSS attacks: left.php, queryframe.php and server\_databases.php.

### Severity

We consider these vulnerabilities to be serious. However, (1) can be exploited only on systems not running in PHP safe mode (unless a deliberate hole was opened by including in open\_basedir some paths containing sensitive data).

### Affected Versions

We did not make an extensive verification on this. Probably all previous versions.

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.6.4-pl3 or newer.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

language today, with more than 80 websites worldwide taking advantage of PHP
solutions.

All of the most popular CMS platforms – including WordPress,
Joomla!, and Drupal (just to name a few) leverage this technology. It’s
flexibility and versatility make it a powerhouse programming language, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean that it is as secure as it could or should be “right
out of the box”, so to speak.

It’s popularity, it’s widespread adaptation, and its
relatively easy to learn structure has made PHP a major target for cyber
criminals and hackers to exploit. This is why it’s mission-critical that you
harden your PHP files server-side as much as possible, protecting your server,
your content, and your visitors from these kinds of dangerous exploits.

PHP can be hardened manually as well as with patching
protocols. Below we highlight the steps you’ll want to take to make sure that
your PHP installation is as locked down as possible.

**Locate the PHP Config File You’re Hardening on Your Server**

The very first step in hardening your PHP installation is
first finding the PHP configuration file on your server to begin with.

Depending on the hosting that you are taking advantage of
(the actual provider as well as the type of hosting you have selected) it can
be in a variety of different locations. The best way to quickly locate this
critical file is to simply do a server-side search for “PHP.ini” as this is the
actual file that you’ll want to modify, edit, and harden moving forward.

**Editing the File on Shared Hosting**

Individuals looking to harden their PHP on a shared hosting platform (see [The Blog Starter](https://www.theblogstarter.com/) for hosting options) will have a bit of a tougher hill to climb, if only because most providers do not offer root access to the server with this level of hosting.

You’ll have to contact your hosting provider directly to see
if you can edit the main PHP.ini file itself. In the event that you aren’t
allowed this kind of access, you can still request to have access to the
“.HTaccess” file on your server to make the changes you need to.

You won’t be able to make changes quite as quickly this way
as you would have been able to with a patch (like we highlight below), but you
can manually make individual line edits to your PHP settings this way to enjoy
a higher level of security.

Shared hosting may still have limitations on the PHP elements you can edit no matter how much access you are granted. If you want total control over hardening your PHP (and total control over the security of your web platform), it’s not a bad idea to move to Dedicated or VPS servers if you can afford it.

**Editing the File on Dedicated/VPS servers**

If you are moving forward with a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or Dedicated server set up the process for hardening your PHP is a lot
easier, though it’s still not as quick as applying a server wide patch like we
highlight below.

In the backend administration toolset of your server
solution you’ll find a tool called the Web Host Manager. This is usually
located under the “Service Configuration” settings option in your backend
dashboard.

This tool is going to allow you to select the PHP
Configuration Editor, and editor that allows you to make changes to your
PHP.ini file through a more user-friendly interface than actually downloading
the file, opening it up in Notepad or a similar application, and then making
the edits individually with the actual source code itself.

There are a handful of individual settings that you’re going
to want to reconfigure manually when taking this approach to hardening your PHP
installation, including (but not limited to):

•           Remote
Connections

•           Run Time
Settings

•           Input Data
Restrictions

•           Error
Handling

•           Restrict
File Access

•           File
Uploads

•           Session
Security

•           Soap Cache

… And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

**Use a Patch like Suhosin to Harden PHP Almost Instantly**

The big attraction behind PHP is that it is so easy to learn,
so easy to develop with, and about as flexible as a programming language gets –
and that’s why a lot of people feel comfortable hardening their PHP manually,
running line by line through their PHP.ini file and doing the heavy lifting of
securing their system on their own.

And while you may be a top-tier programmer and feel
completely confident in your coding prowess, the truth of the matter is that if
you allow ANY coding from ANY outside developers to run on your server you’ll
still have vulnerabilities that you may not be able to address independently –
vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire platform.

This is why patching your PHP systemwide is such a savvy
move, and why so many developers, programmers, and website/web application
owners utilizing PHP decide to move forward with a solution like Suhosin.

Engineered specifically to provide an advanced layer of
protection to PHP installations, the Suhosin patch is a dual action component
that provides a level of hardening that may not be possible through any other
manual approach.

On the one hand, Suhosin works to patch the PHP core on your
server. This allows this patch to protect against issues like format string
vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and other issues that may plague your as of
yet unsecured PHP installation.

On the other hand, Suhosin also acts as an extension to the
PHP that has already been installed on your server. This extension runs 24/7,
around-the-clock, to protect against all kinds of vulnerabilities (including
runtime vulnerabilities) as well as individual session issues while adding a
whole host of logging, filtering, and administrative tools at the same time.

Best of all, the installation of this PHP hardening patch is
about as simple and as straightforward as it gets.

All of the features it has to offer exist within its
extension module and “flipping the switch” to allow that extension to run is as
easy as activating the individual extension inside of the PHP.ini file.
Sometimes you’ll have to manually add a couple of extra Configuration
Directives to trigger the full suite of extension capabilities, but most of the
time the Suhosin patch works just as soon as the edits to the PHP.ini file go
live.

# phpMyAdmin: Local file inclusion and XSS vulnerabilities — GLSA **200510-21**

phpMyAdmin contains a local file inclusion vulnerability that may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code, along with several cross-site scripting
issues.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/phpmyadmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6.4\_p3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6.4\_p3** |

### Background

phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
administration of MySQL over the web.

### Description

Stefan Esser discovered that by calling certain PHP files directly, it
was possible to workaround the grab\_globals.lib.php security model and
overwrite the $cfg configuration array. Systems running PHP in safe
mode are not affected. Futhermore, Tobias Klein reported several
cross-site-scripting issues resulting from insufficient user input
sanitizing.

### Impact

A local attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious
requests, causing the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of
the user running the web server. Furthermore, the cross-site scripting
issues give a remote attacker the ability to inject and execute
malicious script code or to steal cookie-based authentication
credentials, potentially compromising the victim's browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround for all those issues at this time.

### Resolution

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.4_p3"
```

### Summary

(1) Local file inclusion vulnerability and (2) Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability

### Description

We received a security advisory from Stefan Esser (sesser@hardened-php.net) about (1). We received a security advisory from Tobias Klein (tk@trapkit.de) about (2). We wish to thank both of them for their work.

(1) : Due to the sequence of execution in the code that gets form parameters in some scripts, it was possible to craft a special attack form that overwrites configuration parameters.

(2) : Some scripts were vulnerable to XSS attacks: left.php, queryframe.php and server\_databases.php.

### Severity

We consider these vulnerabilities to be serious. However, (1) can be exploited only on systems not running in PHP safe mode (unless a deliberate hole was opened by including in open\_basedir some paths containing sensitive data).

### Affected Versions

We did not make an extensive verification on this. Probably all previous versions.

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.6.4-pl3 or newer.
