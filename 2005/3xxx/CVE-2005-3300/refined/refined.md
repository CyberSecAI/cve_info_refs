Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-3300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a design flaw in how phpMyAdmin includes its `register_globals` compatibility layer within `grab_globals.php`. This file is included to emulate the `register_globals` feature, which is often turned off on modern PHP installations. However, some files in phpMyAdmin that are not intended to be called directly do not include `grab_globals.php` at the beginning. Instead, they include `common.lib.php` which eventually includes `grab_globals.php` through `select_lang.lib.php`. This causes the global request variable extraction to occur *after* the `$cfg` configuration array is loaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unprotected `_FILES` Array:** When merging request variables into the global namespace, phpMyAdmin fails to adequately protect the `_FILES` array (which contains information about uploaded files) against having keys that overwrite configuration parameters (specifically, keys named 'cfg').
- **Configuration Overwriting:** By manipulating the `_FILES` array, an attacker can overwrite elements of the `$cfg` array.  Specifically, an attacker can empty `$cfg['ThemePath']` which contains the path to the themes directory, and set `$cfg['ThemeManager']` to true.
- **Local File Inclusion:** By overwriting the `$cfg['ThemePath']` variable to an empty string, and controlling the `$GLOBALS['theme']` variable (typically via a user-supplied cookie), an attacker can manipulate the include statement: `@include($cfg['ThemePath'].'/'.$GLOBALS['theme'].'/info.inc.php');` to include any local file by using path truncation techniques or a null byte injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Local File Inclusion:** Attackers can include arbitrary local files accessible to the webserver.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Since arbitrary local files can be included, this usually leads to the possibility of remote code execution by including a crafted file containing malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a special HTTP request that includes a manipulated `_FILES` array. This is achieved by crafting a multipart/form-data POST request with a crafted file upload field.
- **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker also manipulates a cookie variable to inject the desired filename in the `$GLOBALS['theme']` variable.
- **Path Truncation:** The attacker utilizes path truncation techniques (either using %00 or realpath() depending on the server configuration) to include the arbitrary local file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand the vulnerability and know how to craft the special HTTP requests and cookie to exploit it.
- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to be able to send a multipart/form-data POST request to upload a file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is not exploitable when PHP is running in safe mode or when the Hardened-PHP patch is applied due to its protection against filename truncation attacks.
- The vulnerability is exploitable with or without magic_quotes_gpc enabled, depending on whether the path truncation technique used is `%00` or realpath() truncation.
- The vulnerability is described as a "design flaw" in the way the `register_globals` emulation layer is handled.
- This vulnerability was discovered by Stefan Esser.
