Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the email from Secunia Research:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from two issues in how the Opera Mail client handles attachments:
1.  **Direct opening from cache:** Attached files are opened directly from the user's cache directory without warnings.
2.  **Filename extension spoofing:** The mail client determines file extensions based on the "Content-Type", but allows appending an additional "." to the end of a filename, enabling a malicious file like an HTML file to appear as another file type like "image.jpg.".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Unrestricted file access:** The mail client's behavior of directly opening files from the cache without user interaction makes it vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript execution.
2.  **Filename spoofing:** The ability to add an extra '.' at the end of a filename allows malicious HTML files to appear as safe file types (like images or other media), which can trick users into opening them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Combined, these vulnerabilities enable script insertion attacks. An attacker can send a specially crafted email with a malicious HTML file disguised as a safe file type (e.g., "image.jpg.") as an attachment. If the user opens this attachment, the embedded JavaScript can be executed within the context of the local file system ("file://"). This could potentially lead to disclosure of local files and other security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through email. A remote attacker sends a specially crafted email with a malicious attachment to a victim using the vulnerable Opera Mail client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs the ability to send emails to the victim. They also need to be able to craft malicious HTML attachments with spoofed file names. No special network access is needed other than the ability to send an email.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jakob Balle from Secunia Research.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderately Critical" by Secunia.
- The affected software is Opera 8.02 and prior versions may also be affected.
- A fix is available in Opera 8.50.
