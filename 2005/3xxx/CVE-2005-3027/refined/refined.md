Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-3027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Sybari Antigen for Exchange/SMTP processes rules when handling SMTP messages. Specifically, the software fails to properly apply custom filters when a specific subject line is present.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Rule Bypass:** Antigen improperly processes rules, allowing a specially crafted email subject line to bypass configured attachment filters.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The software incorrectly handles a specific subject line ("Antigen forwarded attachment"), leading to the filter bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassed Attachment Filtering:** Attackers can send emails with unwanted file types (that would normally be blocked) into user inboxes.
- **Potential for Malicious Payload Delivery:** While the vulnerability doesn't bypass virus scanning, it allows for the delivery of file types not normally permitted, which can be malicious or against company policy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Message:** The primary attack vector is through sending specially crafted emails.
- **Specific Subject Line:** The exploit requires that the email's subject line is set to "Antigen forwarded attachment."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Email Access:** Attackers need the ability to send emails to a system using Sybari Antigen for Exchange/SMTP.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:**  The attacker must know about the specific subject line needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability does not bypass or disable virus scanning of attachments.
- The exploit allows unwanted file types into inboxes, this could cause an issue even if files are not malicious, but do violate company policy on file types.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Antigen v8.0 SR3 for Exchange/SMTP Version 8.00.1517 SR3
