 Guidelines:
1. First verify if the content relates to the CVE specified based on the official description
2. If the content does not relate to this CVE, respond with "UNRELATED"
3. If no useful vulnerability information is found, respond with "NOINFO" 
4. For relevant content, extract:
   - Root cause of vulnerability
   - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
   - Impact of exploitation
   - Attack vectors
   - Required attacker capabilities/position

Additional instructions:
- Preserve original technical details and descriptions
- Remove unrelated content
- Translate non-English content to English
- Note if the content provides more detail than the official CVE description
