    "additional_details": "The vulnerability specifically affects applications that are setuid/setgid and are linked to the libuim.  The vulnerability also affects immodule-enabled Qt if you build Qt 3.3.2 or later versions with USE=\"immqt\" or USE=\"immqt-bc\". A patch was created to check the is_setugid flag and prevent loading of the custom configuration if the flag is set to true."
