How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

*docker.errors.DockerException: Error while fetching server API version: ('Connection aborted.', FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory'))*

This error message displays when Podman isn't installed properly, or the user has logged in using the root user (sudo su). Follow the steps below:

1. Remove Podman, sudo yum remove podman-remote.
2. Log out of the current user and log in again.
3. Run, ./external/install.sh.

Note: Do not change the user to root ("sudo su" or any other related command) or use sudo while running the script.

The media server needs 1 :1 NAT, which means any traffic egress and ingress for the media server for the internet needs to use the public IP. The media server auto-discovers its public IP to use the STUN protocol, once you have configured 1:1  NAT for the media server on your router or firewall. Please go to the admin interface of the WebRTC gateway and make sure that the mediaver can detect its public IP address.

[https://adminwebrtc.yourdomain.com/admin/#/servers](https://admindev.rtc.dev.adobeconnect.com/admin/#/servers)

Media Server is not reachable from Clients even after 1:1 NAT working fine

The WebRTC Client uses ICE and tries to establish an audio-video stream with the media server in the order below:

* UDP in port range 35000 to 65535
* TCP over port 3478

* TLS over port 443
* C12 WebRTC based Client will try all options (TCP and UDP) , before it switches to TLS over port 443

Connect 12 is by default designed with the assumption that CPS and WebRTC and New Connect Cluster (aka NCC) are in the same VLAN/VPC or broadcast domain. In case you've them in different networks, ensure that you've proper layer three routing between CPS and NCC/WebRTC to have network connectivity in both directions.

To check the network connectivity between CPS and NCC, use CURL and Telnet.

CPS and NCC connectivity work over HTTPS only.

The error below appears in the FMGW container logs. The second Redis instance is set to run as a replica.

*ERROR [FM.LiveSwitch.Signalling.Server.IdleThread][-] 2022-07-21T12:46:29.439Z Unexpected error in idle thread.

StackExchange.Redis.RedisServerException: READONLY You can't write against a read only replica.*

**Solution**:

Open the configuration file corresponding to the Redis service and modify the value of the attribute "slave-read-only" to “no”.

As a workaround, follow the steps below:

1. cd ncc-onprem-installer.
2. mv Images images.
3. sed -i 's/Images\//images\//' Installer/utils/global\_constants.py.
4. Uninstall - Execute uninstall.sh.
5. Reinstall - Execute MainInstall.sh.
