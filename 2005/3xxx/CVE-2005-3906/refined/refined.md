{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment's Reflection APIs allow untrusted applets to bypass security restrictions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unspecified vulnerabilities in the Reflection API.",
    "Inadequate security restrictions for Java applets."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the applet. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of system resources.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Embedding a malicious Java applet in a web page.",
    "Enticing a user to view the malicious web page."
  ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Ability to embed malicious Java applets in web pages.",
    "Ability to convince users to view the malicious web page."
