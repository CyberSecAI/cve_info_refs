Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2005-3790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient input validation in multiple PHP scripts within the PHPWCMS content management system. Specifically, the `login.php` and `random_image.php` scripts are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks due to inadequate sanitization of user-supplied parameters. Additionally, `act_newsletter.php` is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):**
    *   Vulnerable scripts: `login.php` and `random_image.php`
    *   The scripts do not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (e.g., `form_lang` parameter in `login.php` and `imgdir` in `random_image.php`). This allows attackers to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) into file paths, potentially accessing files and directories outside of the intended web root.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Vulnerable script: `act_newsletter.php`
    *   The script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, particularly the email address field or `text` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code which can then be executed in the browser of a user visiting the site.
    *   Two attack vectors exist: one when `register_globals` is off, using base64 encoding to inject javascript code, and one when `register_globals` is on, using a `text` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Directory Traversal:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, such as the `/etc/passwd` file (as explicitly mentioned in the advisory). This can expose user credentials and other sensitive data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Cookie Stealing:** Attackers can steal user cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user sessions and accounts.
    *   **Malicious Code Execution:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including redirecting users to other websites, capturing keystrokes, or modifying the appearance or behavior of the vulnerable site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Directory Traversal:**
    *   HTTP GET or POST requests to the vulnerable scripts: `login.php` or `random_image.php`
    *   Manipulation of the `form_lang` parameter in `login.php` or the `imgdir` parameter in `random_image.php` to include directory traversal sequences like `../`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   HTTP GET request to `act_newsletter.php`
    *   Injecting malicious JavaScript into the `i` parameter (when register_globals is off) or `text` parameter (when register_globals is on).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers require the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerabilities can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication on the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability was discovered by Stefan Lochbihler.
* The vendor (PHPWCMS) was notified about the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was found during an audit of the PHPWCMS project.
* The provided text includes a CVSS base score of 4.3/10, Impact subscore of 2.9/10 and an exploitability subscore of 8.6/10, which indicates that the exploit is easily exploitable, and the impact would be partial integrity and confidentiality.
