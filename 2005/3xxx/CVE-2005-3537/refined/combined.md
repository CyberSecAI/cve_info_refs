How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpBB, a fully
featured and skinnable flat webforum,

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2005-3310

    Multiple interpretation errors allow remote authenticated users to
    inject arbitrary web script when remote avatars and avatar
    uploading are enabled.

CVE-2005-3415

    phpBB allows remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that
    deregister global variables that allows attackers to manipulate
    the behaviour of phpBB.

CVE-2005-3416

    phpBB allows remote attackers to bypass security checks when
    register_globals is enabled and the session_start function has not
    been called to handle a session.

CVE-2005-3417

    phpBB allows remote attackers to modify global variables and
    bypass security mechanisms.

CVE-2005-3418

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts.

CVE-2005-3419

    An SQL injection vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2005-3420

    phpBB allows remote attackers to modify regular expressions and
    execute PHP code via the signature_bbcode_uid parameter.

CVE-2005-3536

    Missing input sanitising of the topic type allows remote attackers
    to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2005-3537

    Missing request validation permitted remote attackers to edit
    private messages of other users.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain phpbb2 packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.13+1-6sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.18-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpbb2 packages.
