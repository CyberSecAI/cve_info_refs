Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, relating to CVE-2005-3206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Oracle iSQL\*Plus web interface, a web-based tool for accessing SQL\*Plus. This interface allows a user to send commands to the Oracle TNS Listener. The TNS listener was not protected with a password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unprotected TNS Listener:** The primary weakness is that the TNS Listener, which manages database connections, could be stopped remotely without authentication due to not being protected with a password.
*   **Abuse of iSQL\*Plus:** The iSQL\*Plus web interface, intended for SQL\*Plus interaction, can be exploited to send a command to stop the TNS Listener.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a denial-of-service. By stopping the TNS Listener, the attacker can effectively prevent any new connections to the Oracle database. This disrupts availability, making the database inaccessible to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack via iSQL\*Plus:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a specially crafted URL to the vulnerable iSQL\*Plus interface.
* The attack vector is over the network via HTTP by sending a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the Oracle database and its iSQL\*Plus interface.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability and issue the command to stop the listener, as the listener was not password-protected.
*  The attacker needs to know the correct syntax to send the command via the URL.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability was tested against Oracle Database 9.0.2.4.
*   The fix was included in the Critical Patch Update July 2005 (CPU July 2005). Oracle did not inform Red-Database-Security that the bug was fixed in the patch.
