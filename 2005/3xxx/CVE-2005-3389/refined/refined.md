  "CVE-2005-3389": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the PHP parse_str() function. If a PHP script passes only one argument to the parse_str() function, and the script can be forced to abort execution during operation (for example due to the memory_limit setting), the register_globals may be enabled even if it is disabled in the PHP configuration file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `parse_str()` function within PHP. When this function is called with only one argument and the script execution is abruptly terminated (e.g., due to memory limitations), the `register_globals` setting could be enabled despite being explicitly disabled in the PHP configuration.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of execution termination during `parse_str()` function calls.",
        "Unintended enabling of `register_globals`."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this to enable the `register_globals` setting. This could then expose other vulnerabilities within the PHP application that would normally be protected when `register_globals` is disabled. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other forms of unauthorized access and control.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a crafted request to a PHP script that uses `parse_str()` with a single argument, then triggering a script abort (e.g. via memory limits).",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger a memory limit or otherwise force the termination of the PHP script after the call to `parse_str`.",
       "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists in the `parse_str()` function which when called with one argument, might enable `register_globals` upon premature script termination, even when disabled in the configuration. This allows the attacker to exploit other security flaws in the php programs."
