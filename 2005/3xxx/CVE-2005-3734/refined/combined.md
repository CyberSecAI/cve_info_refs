Advisory: Multiple Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities in
phpMyFAQ
Name: TKADV2005-11-004
Revision: 1.0
Release Date: 2005/11/19
Last Modified: 2005/11/19
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: phpMyFAQ (all versions <= phpMyFAQ 1.5.3)
Risk: Critical ( ) High (x) Medium ( ) Low ( )
Vendor URL: http://www.phpmyfaq.de/
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
=========
Overview:
=========
phpMyFAQ is a multilingual, completely database-driven FAQ-system.
Version 1.5.3 and prior contain multiple persistent Cross Site
Scripting vulnerabilities.
======================
Vulnerability details:
======================
All the following vulnerabilities are exploitable by an anonymous
user. Because of that all these issues are rated with a high
probability of occurrence.
For a description of the calculation of the resulting threat of a
vulnerability see reference [3].
All vulnerabilities are exploitable, no matter if magic\_quotes\_gpc
is turned on or off.
[1] Cross Site Scripting
Possible damage: High
Probability of occurrence: High
Resulting threat: High
HTTP method: POST
XSS type: persistent
Vulnerability description:
The "username" parameter is prone to cross-site scripting attacks.
This could permit an attacker to embed a malicious link into the
context of the web application that includes hostile client-side
script code or HTML. If the appropriate site within the application
is visited, the attacker-supplied code is rendered in the browser
of the user who visits the site. No further user interaction is
needed.
URL with vulnerable POST form:
[path\_to\_phpmyfaq]/faq/index.php?sid=2⟨=en&action=add
Vulnerable POST Parameter: username
Proof of Concept (POST request):
POST [path\_to\_phpmyfaq]/faq/index.php?sid=2⟨=en&action=save
HTTP/1.1
Parameter | Value
------------------------------------------------------
username | " onmouseover="alert(document.cookie);
usermail | test
rubrik%5B%5D | 1
thema | test
content | test
keywords | test
contentlink | http://
submit | submit
------------------------------------------------------
If an administrator now wants to approve this new record within the
admin interface and moves the mouse pointer over the "Author" form-
field, the injected script code gets executed.
[2] Cross Site Scripting
Possible damage: High
Probability of occurrence: High
Resulting threat: High
HTTP method: POST
XSS type: persistent
Vulnerability description:
The "usermail" parameter is prone to cross-site scripting attacks.
This could permit an attacker to embed a malicious link into the
context of the web application that includes hostile client-side
script code or HTML. If the appropriate site within the application
is visited, the attacker-supplied code is rendered in the browser
of the user who visits the site. No further user interaction is
needed.
URL with vulnerable POST form:
[path\_to\_phpmyfaq]/faq/index.php?sid=2⟨=en&action=add
Vulnerable POST Parameter: usermail
Proof of Concept (POST request):
POST [path\_to\_phpmyfaq]/faq/index.php?sid=2⟨=en&action=save
HTTP/1.1
Parameter | Value
------------------------------------------------------
username | test
usermail | " onmouseover="alert(document.cookie);
rubrik%5B%5D | 1
thema | test
content | test
keywords | test
contentlink | http://
submit | submit
------------------------------------------------------
If an administrator now wants to approve this new record within the
admin interface and moves the mouse pointer over the "email adress"
form-field, the injected script code gets executed.
[3] Cross Site Scripting
Possible damage: High
Probability of occurrence: High
Resulting threat: High
HTTP method: POST
XSS type: persistent
Vulnerability description:
The "thema" parameter is prone to cross-site scripting attacks.
This could permit an attacker to embed a malicious link into the
context of the web application that includes hostile client-side
script code or HTML. If the appropriate site within the application
is visited, the attacker-supplied code is rendered in the browser
of the user who visits the site. No further user interaction is
needed.
URL with vulnerable POST form:
[path\_to\_phpmyfaq]/faq/index.php?sid=2⟨=en&action=add
Vulnerable POST Parameter: thema
Proof of Concept (POST request):
POST [path\_to\_phpmyfaq]/faq/index.php?sid=2⟨=en&action=save
HTTP/1.1
Parameter | Value
------------------------------------------------------
username | test
usermail | test
rubrik%5B%5D | 1
thema | ' : ''}; alert(document.cookie); //
content | test
keywords | test
contentlink | http://
submit | submit
------------------------------------------------------
This special PoC code only works, if it is the last entry in the
record list.
If an administrator now wants to approve this new record within the
admin interface and clicks on the appropriate topic, the injected
script code gets executed.
