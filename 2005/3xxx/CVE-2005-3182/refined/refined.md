Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the HTTP management interface of GFI MailSecurity 8.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, where sending large strings in specific HTTP headers overwrites critical parts of memory. Specifically, the 'Host' or 'Accept' headers are mentioned as areas where large strings can trigger the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain administrative control of the targeted host. This means the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP requests. The attacker needs to send an HTTP request with oversized header fields (specifically, 'Host' or 'Accept' headers).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the GFI MailSecurity web management interface. This implies that the attacker needs network access to the affected server, possibly remotely if the management interface is exposed to the internet or an untrusted network.
*  **HTTP Fuzzing knowledge** The advisory states verification of the vulnerability can be achieved through the use of a HTTP fuzzer

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was verified on Windows 2000 Server.
*   A patch was released to address this issue
* The vendor has released a patch
