                             Security Advisory

Advisory Name:	GFI MailSecurity 8.1 Web Module Buffer Overflow
 Release Date:	12/October/2005
  Application: 	GFI MailSecurity For SMTP version 8.1

     Platform: 	Verified on Windows 2000 Server
     Severity: 	Remote Code Execution
       Author: 	Gary O'leary-Steele
Vendor Status: 	Patch Released
CVE Candidate: 	Pending
    Reference:  	<http://www.sec-1.com>

Overview:

Taken from gfi.com:

GFI MailSecurity for SMTP is a Content filtering, anti-virus and
Email Intrusion prevention product from GFI.

GFI MailSecurity is available as an SMTP gateway version and for
VS API. The gateway version should be deployed at the perimeter
of the network as a mail relay server and scans inbound and
outbound mail. The VS API version integrates seamlessly with
Exchange Server 2000/2003 and scans the Exchange information stores.
Both versions can be deployed simultaneously to achieve optimum
protection.

Vulnerability Details:

Sec-1 has identified an exploitable Buffer Overflow within the HTTP
management interface. By sending large strings within several areas
of the HTTP request (such as a large 'Host' or 'Accept' header)
critical portions of memory are overwritten. Verification of this
vulnerability can be achieved through the use of a HTTP fuzzer, such
as @stake webproxy. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker
to gain administrative control of the targeted host.

Vendor Response:

The vendor has released information and a patch

KB:	<http://kbase.gfi.com/showarticle.asp?id=KBID002451>
Patch: ftp://ftp.gfi.com/patches/MSEC8_PATCH_20050919_01.zip

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Information:

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the following names to these issues.  These are candidates for
inclusion in the CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>), which standardizes
names for security problems.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
