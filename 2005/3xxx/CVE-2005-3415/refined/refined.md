```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: phpBB's code intended to deregister global variables created due to the register_globals directive can be bypassed in several ways, allowing attackers to manipulate the behavior of phpBB.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - In PHP5 <= 5.0.5, global variables can be registered using `GLOBALS[foobar]`, bypassing the unset mechanism.
    - If the session extension is not started by session_start(), `HTTP_SESSION_VARS` can be set to a string, causing `array_merge()` to fail and the unset mechanism to fail.
    - When register_long_array is off, HTTP_* variables can be filled with unrelated values, rendering the unset mechanism ineffective.
    - Uninitialized variables (error_msg, forward_page, list_cat) can be used for HTML injection.
    - The variable `signature_bbcode_uid` can be used for SQL injection.
    - The variable `signature_bbcode_uid` can be used to inject the 'e' modifier into `preg_replace()` allowing arbitrary PHP code execution.
  - Impact of exploitation: Bypassing protection mechanisms can allow manipulation of phpBB's behavior. Uninitialized variables lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. SQL injection can lead to arbitrary SQL command execution. Exploiting the preg_replace vulnerability leads to remote code execution.
  - Attack vectors: Remote attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by manipulating GET/POST/COOKIE variables.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpBB application. In some scenarios, they might need to have an active user session or be an authenticated user.
