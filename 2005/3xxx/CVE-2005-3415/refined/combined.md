Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpBB, a fully
featured and skinnable flat webforum,

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2005-3310

    Multiple interpretation errors allow remote authenticated users to
    inject arbitrary web script when remote avatars and avatar
    uploading are enabled.

CVE-2005-3415

    phpBB allows remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that
    deregister global variables that allows attackers to manipulate
    the behaviour of phpBB.

CVE-2005-3416

    phpBB allows remote attackers to bypass security checks when
    register_globals is enabled and the session_start function has not
    been called to handle a session.

CVE-2005-3417

    phpBB allows remote attackers to modify global variables and
    bypass security mechanisms.

CVE-2005-3418

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts.

CVE-2005-3419

    An SQL injection vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2005-3420

    phpBB allows remote attackers to modify regular expressions and
    execute PHP code via the signature_bbcode_uid parameter.

CVE-2005-3536

    Missing input sanitising of the topic type allows remote attackers
    to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2005-3537

    Missing request validation permitted remote attackers to edit
    private messages of other users.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain phpbb2 packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.13+1-6sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.18-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpbb2 packages.

 Hardened-PHP Project

Security Advisory
Advisory: phpBB Multiple Vulnerabilities
Release Date: 2005/10/31
Last Modified: 2005/10/31
Author: Stefan Esser [sesser@hardened-php.net]
Application: phpBB <= 2.0.17
Severity: Multiple vulnerabilities allow XSS, SQL injection and remote code execution
Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
References: http://www.hardened-php.net/advisory\_172005.75.html
Overview:
Quote from www.phpbb.com:
"phpBB is a high powered, fully scalable, and highly customizable Open Source bulletin board package. phpBB has a user-friendly
interface, simple and straightforward administration panel, and
helpful FAQ. Based on the powerful PHP server language and your
choice of MySQL, MS-SQL, PostgreSQL or Access/ODBC database
servers, phpBB is the ideal free community solution for all
web sites."
Because of our research into register\_globals deregistration
codes, the implementation within phpBB was audited and several
weaknesses were found, that allowed to completely bypass the
protection on PHP5 servers.
After these weaknesses were found and disclosed to the vendor
nearly 80 days ago, several problems with unitialised variables
were discovered that allow XSS, SQL injection and even remote
execution of arbitrary PHP code, when phpBB is used with
register\_globals turned on.
While register\_globals=off is the recommended setting, most web-
hosters, even those that actually run PHP5, still have it
enabled because it is their customers wish.
Details:
To get rid of possible security problems caused by not properly
initialised variables phpBB comes with the following piece of
code, that is intended to deregister global variables, which were
created because of the register\_globals directive. Unfortunately
there are atleast 3 ways to bypass the protection.
// PHP4+ path
$not\_unset = array('HTTP\_GET\_VARS', 'HTTP\_POST\_VARS',
'HTTP\_COOKIE\_VARS', 'HTTP\_SERVER\_VARS',
'HTTP\_SESSION\_VARS', 'HTTP\_ENV\_VARS',
'HTTP\_POST\_FILES', 'phpEx', 'phpbb\_root\_path');
// Not only will array\_merge give a warning if a parameter
// is not an array, it will actually fail. So we check if
// HTTP\_SESSION\_VARS has been initialised.
if (!isset($HTTP\_SESSION\_VARS))
{
$HTTP\_SESSION\_VARS = array();
}
// Merge all into one extremely huge array; unset
// this later
$input = array\_merge($HTTP\_GET\_VARS, $HTTP\_POST\_VARS,
$HTTP\_COOKIE\_VARS, $HTTP\_SERVER\_VARS,
$HTTP\_SESSION\_VARS, $HTTP\_ENV\_VARS,
$HTTP\_POST\_FILES);
unset($input['input']);
unset($input['not\_unset']);
while (list($var,) = @each($input))
{
if (!in\_array($var, $not\_unset))
{
unset($$var);
}
}
unset($input);
Bypass Vulnerabilities
----------------------
[1] In PHP5 <= 5.0.5 it is possible to register f.e. the global
variable $foobar by supplying a GET/POST/COOKIE variable
with the name 'foobar' but also by supplying a GPC variable
called 'GLOBALS[foobar]'. If the variable is supplied in
that way, the code above will not try to unset $foobar, but
$GLOBALS, which completely bypasses the protection.
[2] When the session extension is not started by a call to
session\_start(), PHP does not know about the variables
$\_SESSION or $HTTP\_SESSION\_VARS, which means, it is possible
to fill them with any value if register\_globals is turned on.
Combined with the fact (that was even documented in the phpBB
code), that array\_merge() will fail in PHP5, when at least
one of the parameters is not an array, it is possible for an
attacker to simply set HTTP\_SESSION\_VARS to a string and let
the complete protection fail, because $input ends up empty.
[3] When register\_long\_array is turned off PHP does not know
anymore about all the HTTP\_\* variables. This means they can
be filled with anything that is completely unrelated to the
existing global variables. It is obvious that the protection
cannot work, when this configuration is choosen.
Additonally to the 3 possible ways to bypass the globals
deregistration code, several not properly initalised variables
were disclosed to the vendor, that can even lead to remote code
execution.
Not properly initialised variables
----------------------------------
[1] Within usercp\_register.php the variable 'error\_msg' is not
properly initialised and can therefore be used to inject
arbitrary HTML code
[2] Within login.php the variable 'forward\_page' is not properly
initialised and can be used to inject arbitrary HTML code
[3] Within search.php the variable 'list\_cat' is not properly
initialised and can be used to inject arbitrary HTML
[4] Within usercp\_register.php the variable 'signature\_bbcode\_uid'
is not properly initialised and can be used for SQL injection
of arbitrary 'field=xxx' statements into queries operating
on the user table, when magic\_quotes\_gpc is turned off.
[5] The same variable [4] can be used to inject f.e. the 'e'
modifier into the first parameter of a preg\_replace()
statement, which means, that the second parameter is
evaluated as PHP code. Because the second parameter is
entirely filled with the user supplied signature, it is
possible to execute any PHP code. This can be exploited,
no matter if magic\_quotes\_gpc is turned on or off, just
2 different code paths need to be triggered.
Proof of Concept:
The Hardened-PHP project is not going to release exploits for any
of these vulnerabilities to the public.
Disclosure Timeline:
14. August 2005 - First contact with vendor through their
security bugtracker.
30. October 2005 - Vendor released new version.
31. October 2005 - Public disclosure.
Recommendation:
It is strongly recommended to upgrade to the new phpBB release
or to switch to another bulletin board application.
You can get the new phpBB release at:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Hardened PHP

PHP is far and away the most popular backend programming
language today, with more than 80 websites worldwide taking advantage of PHP
solutions.

All of the most popular CMS platforms – including WordPress,
Joomla!, and Drupal (just to name a few) leverage this technology. It’s
flexibility and versatility make it a powerhouse programming language, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean that it is as secure as it could or should be “right
out of the box”, so to speak.

It’s popularity, it’s widespread adaptation, and its
relatively easy to learn structure has made PHP a major target for cyber
criminals and hackers to exploit. This is why it’s mission-critical that you
harden your PHP files server-side as much as possible, protecting your server,
your content, and your visitors from these kinds of dangerous exploits.

PHP can be hardened manually as well as with patching
protocols. Below we highlight the steps you’ll want to take to make sure that
your PHP installation is as locked down as possible.

**Locate the PHP Config File You’re Hardening on Your Server**

The very first step in hardening your PHP installation is
first finding the PHP configuration file on your server to begin with.

Depending on the hosting that you are taking advantage of
(the actual provider as well as the type of hosting you have selected) it can
be in a variety of different locations. The best way to quickly locate this
critical file is to simply do a server-side search for “PHP.ini” as this is the
actual file that you’ll want to modify, edit, and harden moving forward.

**Editing the File on Shared Hosting**

Individuals looking to harden their PHP on a shared hosting platform (see [The Blog Starter](https://www.theblogstarter.com/) for hosting options) will have a bit of a tougher hill to climb, if only because most providers do not offer root access to the server with this level of hosting.

You’ll have to contact your hosting provider directly to see
if you can edit the main PHP.ini file itself. In the event that you aren’t
allowed this kind of access, you can still request to have access to the
“.HTaccess” file on your server to make the changes you need to.

You won’t be able to make changes quite as quickly this way
as you would have been able to with a patch (like we highlight below), but you
can manually make individual line edits to your PHP settings this way to enjoy
a higher level of security.

Shared hosting may still have limitations on the PHP elements you can edit no matter how much access you are granted. If you want total control over hardening your PHP (and total control over the security of your web platform), it’s not a bad idea to move to Dedicated or VPS servers if you can afford it.

**Editing the File on Dedicated/VPS servers**

If you are moving forward with a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or Dedicated server set up the process for hardening your PHP is a lot
easier, though it’s still not as quick as applying a server wide patch like we
highlight below.

In the backend administration toolset of your server
solution you’ll find a tool called the Web Host Manager. This is usually
located under the “Service Configuration” settings option in your backend
dashboard.

This tool is going to allow you to select the PHP
Configuration Editor, and editor that allows you to make changes to your
PHP.ini file through a more user-friendly interface than actually downloading
the file, opening it up in Notepad or a similar application, and then making
the edits individually with the actual source code itself.

There are a handful of individual settings that you’re going
to want to reconfigure manually when taking this approach to hardening your PHP
installation, including (but not limited to):

•           Remote
Connections

•           Run Time
Settings

•           Input Data
Restrictions

•           Error
Handling

•           Restrict
File Access

•           File
Uploads

•           Session
Security

•           Soap Cache

… And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

**Use a Patch like Suhosin to Harden PHP Almost Instantly**

The big attraction behind PHP is that it is so easy to learn,
so easy to develop with, and about as flexible as a programming language gets –
and that’s why a lot of people feel comfortable hardening their PHP manually,
running line by line through their PHP.ini file and doing the heavy lifting of
securing their system on their own.

And while you may be a top-tier programmer and feel
completely confident in your coding prowess, the truth of the matter is that if
you allow ANY coding from ANY outside developers to run on your server you’ll
still have vulnerabilities that you may not be able to address independently –
vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire platform.

This is why patching your PHP systemwide is such a savvy
move, and why so many developers, programmers, and website/web application
owners utilizing PHP decide to move forward with a solution like Suhosin.

Engineered specifically to provide an advanced layer of
protection to PHP installations, the Suhosin patch is a dual action component
that provides a level of hardening that may not be possible through any other
manual approach.

On the one hand, Suhosin works to patch the PHP core on your
server. This allows this patch to protect against issues like format string
vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and other issues that may plague your as of
yet unsecured PHP installation.

On the other hand, Suhosin also acts as an extension to the
PHP that has already been installed on your server. This extension runs 24/7,
around-the-clock, to protect against all kinds of vulnerabilities (including
runtime vulnerabilities) as well as individual session issues while adding a
whole host of logging, filtering, and administrative tools at the same time.

Best of all, the installation of this PHP hardening patch is
about as simple and as straightforward as it gets.

All of the features it has to offer exist within its
extension module and “flipping the switch” to allow that extension to run is as
easy as activating the individual extension inside of the PHP.ini file.
Sometimes you’ll have to manually add a couple of extra Configuration
Directives to trigger the full suite of extension capabilities, but most of the
time the Suhosin patch works just as soon as the edits to the PHP.ini file go
live.

     Advisory: phpBB Multiple Vulnerabilities
 Release Date: 2005/10/31
Last Modified: 2005/10/31
       Author: Stefan Esser [sesser@hardened-php.net]

  Application: phpBB <= 2.0.17
     Severity: Multiple vulnerabilities allow XSS, SQL injection
               and remote code execution
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
   References: <http://www.hardened-php.net/advisory_172005.75.html>

Overview:

   Quote from [www.phpbb.com:](http://www.phpbb.com:)
   "phpBB is a high powered, fully scalable, and highly customizable
   Open Source bulletin board package. phpBB has a user-friendly
   interface, simple and straightforward administration panel, and
   helpful FAQ. Based on the powerful PHP server language and your
   choice of MySQL, MS-SQL, PostgreSQL or Access/ODBC database
   servers, phpBB is the ideal free community solution for all
   web sites."

   Because of our research into register_globals deregistration
   codes, the implementation within phpBB was audited and several
   weaknesses were found, that allowed to completely bypass the
   protection on PHP5 servers.

   After these weaknesses were found and disclosed to the vendor
   nearly 80 days ago, several problems with unitialised variables
   were discovered that allow XSS, SQL injection and even remote
   execution of arbitrary PHP code, when phpBB is used with
   register_globals turned on.

   While register_globals=off is the recommended setting, most web-
   hosters, even those that actually run PHP5, still have it
   enabled because it is their customers wish.

Details:

   To get rid of possible security problems caused by not properly
   initialised variables phpBB comes with the following piece of
   code, that is intended to deregister global variables, which were
   created because of the register_globals directive. Unfortunately
   there are atleast 3 ways to bypass the protection.

   // PHP4+ path
   $not_unset = array('HTTP_GET_VARS', 'HTTP_POST_VARS',
                      'HTTP_COOKIE_VARS', 'HTTP_SERVER_VARS',
		      'HTTP_SESSION_VARS', 'HTTP_ENV_VARS',
		      'HTTP_POST_FILES', 'phpEx', 'phpbb_root_path');

   // Not only will array_merge give a warning if a parameter
   // is not an array, it will actually fail. So we check if
   // HTTP_SESSION_VARS has been initialised.
   if (!isset($HTTP_SESSION_VARS))
   {
      $HTTP_SESSION_VARS = array();
   }

   // Merge all into one extremely huge array; unset
   // this later
   $input = array_merge($HTTP_GET_VARS, $HTTP_POST_VARS,
                        $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS, $HTTP_SERVER_VARS,
			$HTTP_SESSION_VARS, $HTTP_ENV_VARS,
			$HTTP_POST_FILES);

   unset($input['input']);
   unset($input['not_unset']);

   while (list($var,) = @each($input))
   {
      if (!in_array($var, $not_unset))
      {
         unset($$var);
      }
   }

   unset($input);

   Bypass Vulnerabilities
   ----------------------

   [[1]](#1) In PHP5 <= 5.0.5 it is possible to register f.e. the global
       variable $foobar by supplying a GET/POST/COOKIE variable
       with the name 'foobar' but also by supplying a GPC variable
       called 'GLOBALS[foobar]'. If the variable is supplied in
       that way, the code above will not try to unset $foobar, but
       $GLOBALS, which completely bypasses the protection.

   [[2]](#2) When the session extension is not started by a call to
       session_start(), PHP does not know about the variables
       $_SESSION or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS, which means, it is possible
       to fill them with any value if register_globals is turned on.
       Combined with the fact (that was even documented in the phpBB
       code), that array_merge() will fail in PHP5, when at least
       one of the parameters is not an array, it is possible for an
       attacker to simply set HTTP_SESSION_VARS to a string and let
       the complete protection fail, because $input ends up empty.

   [[3]](#3) When register_long_array is turned off PHP does not know
       anymore about all the HTTP_* variables. This means they can
       be filled with anything that is completely unrelated to the
       existing global variables. It is obvious that the protection
       cannot work, when this configuration is choosen.

   Additonally to the 3 possible ways to bypass the globals
   deregistration code, several not properly initalised variables
   were disclosed to the vendor, that can even lead to remote code
   execution.

   Not properly initialised variables
   ----------------------------------

   [[1]](#1) Within usercp_register.php the variable 'error_msg' is not
       properly initialised and can therefore be used to inject
       arbitrary HTML code

   [[2]](#2) Within login.php the variable 'forward_page' is not properly
       initialised and can be used to inject arbitrary HTML code

   [[3]](#3) Within search.php the variable 'list_cat' is not properly
       initialised and can be used to inject arbitrary HTML

   [[4]](#4) Within usercp_register.php the variable 'signature_bbcode_uid'
       is not properly initialised and can be used for SQL injection
       of arbitrary 'field=xxx' statements into queries operating
       on the user table, when magic_quotes_gpc is turned off.

   [[5]](#5) The same variable [[4]](#4) can be used to inject f.e. the 'e'
       modifier into the first parameter of a preg_replace()
       statement, which means, that the second parameter is
       evaluated as PHP code. Because the second parameter is
       entirely filled with the user supplied signature, it is
       possible to execute any PHP code. This can be exploited,
       no matter if magic_quotes_gpc is turned on or off, just
       2 different code paths need to be triggered.

Proof of Concept:

   The Hardened-PHP project is not going to release exploits for any
   of these vulnerabilities to the public.

Disclosure Timeline:

   14. August 2005  - First contact with vendor through their
                      security bugtracker.
   30. October 2005 - Vendor released new version.
   31. October 2005 - Public disclosure.

Recommendation:

   It is strongly recommended to upgrade to the new phpBB release
   or to switch to another bulletin board application.

   You can get the new phpBB release at:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
