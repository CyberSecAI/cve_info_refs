      "source": "issues.apache.org_206599ae_20250125_224348.html",
      "details": "This bug report describes a vulnerability in SpamAssassin where a mail with a large number of 'To' addresses in the header can cause a 'Bus error' in Perl, which is a crash. It is caused by a regular expression failing when processing an overly long header line. The fix involves changing the regex from /^(?:$hdr:[ \\t]+(.*\\n(?:\\s+\\S.*\\n)*))/mig; to /^\\Q$hdr\\E:[ \\t]+(.*?\\n(?![ \\t]))/smgi;, which is more stable and avoids the crash.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause is a poorly written regular expression used to parse email headers, particularly the 'To' field. Nested indeterminate quantifiers in the original regex caused excessive backtracking or deep recursion when processing extremely long header lines, leading to a stack overflow or bus error.",
      "weaknesses": "The vulnerability lies in the inefficient regular expression used to extract header information, leading to a denial of service when processing emails with a large number of recipients in the 'To' header.",
      "impact": "Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service by crashing the Perl process used by SpamAssassin. Though it is mentioned that the spamd service is resilient and will restart crashed child process.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted email with an excessively long 'To' header to an email system using SpamAssassin.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to send an email to a server running a vulnerable version of SpamAssassin. No special system access or prior knowledge about the server configuration is needed."
