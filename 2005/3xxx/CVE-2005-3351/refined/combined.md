How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Fedora alert FEDORA-2005-1065 (spamassassin)

```

```

| From: |  | "Warren Togami" <wtogami@redhat.com> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| To: |  | fedora-announce-list@redhat.com |
| Subject: |  | [SECURITY] Fedora Core 3 Update: spamassassin-3.0.4-2.fc3 |
| Date: |  | Wed, 9 Nov 2005 14:50:08 -0500 |

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2005-1065
2005-11-09
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Product     : Fedora Core 3
Name        : spamassassin
Version     : 3.0.4
Release     : 2.fc3
Summary     : Spam filter for email which can be invoked from mail delivery agents.
Description :
SpamAssassin provides you with a way to reduce if not completely eliminate
Unsolicited Commercial Email (SPAM) from your incoming email.  It can
be invoked by a MDA such as sendmail or postfix, or can be called from
a procmail script, .forward file, etc.  It uses a genetic-algorithm
evolved scoring system to identify messages which look spammy, then
adds headers to the message so they can be filtered by the user's mail
reading software.  This distribution includes the spamd/spamc components
which create a server that considerably speeds processing of mail.

To enable spamassassin, if you are receiving mail locally, simply add
this line to your ~/.procmailrc:
INCLUDERC=/etc/mail/spamassassin/spamassassin-default.rc

To filter spam for all users, add that line to /etc/procmailrc
(creating if necessary).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Solves CVE-2005-3351 and a few other minor bugs to improve
spam detection accuracy.  You could consider this a release
candidate for 3.0.5.

Also solved is #161785 which ensures that "service
spamassassin restart" should never fail.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* Tue Nov  8 2005 Warren Togami <wtogami@redhat.com> - 3.0.4-2
- 3.0.5 release candidate

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=4570#c0)  Mark Martinec    2005-09-05 16:21:25 UTC  ``` I just came across a similar spam message (URL attached) with  insanely lots of recipients listed in its header (1600+), and it  causes 'spamassassin -t -D' to trigger Perl crash with a Bus error.  This is the same bug as discussed on the SA mailing list these days  (reported by Irina <irina <at> nas.net> on 2005-08-18,  subject: "Too many recipients").    Unlike Irina, I run Perl 5.8.7, SA 3.1.0-rc2, and if it matters, this  is a FreeBSD 5.4 (it may matter because Perl memory limits may be different  than on a Linux system). The system is otherwise stable and is processsing  regular company mail in quantities through this same SA/Perl.    The tail of the output from "truss -f spamassassin -t -D <0.lis" is:    [12661] dbg: plugin:    Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::AutoLearnThreshold=HASH(0x9533a60)    implements 'autolearn_discriminator'  12661: write(2,0xa08f804,121)                    = 121 (0x79)  [12661] dbg: learn: auto-learn: currently using scoreset 3,    recomputing score based on scoreset 1  12661: write(2,0xa08f804,98)                     = 98 (0x62)  [12661] dbg: learn: auto-learn: message score: 10.0202857142857,    computed score for autolearn: 7.219  12661: write(2,0xa08f804,101)                    = 101 (0x65)  [12661] dbg: learn: auto-learn? ham=0.1, spam=12, body-points=4.719,    head-points=7.219, learned-points=3.5  12661: write(2,0xa08f804,107)                    = 107 (0x6b)  [12661] dbg: learn: auto-learn? no: inside auto-learn thresholds,    not considered ham or spam  12661: write(2,0xa08f804,93)                     = 93 (0x5d)  12661: unlink("/tmp/.spamassassin12661f3JCzttmp") = 0 (0x0)  [12661] dbg: check: is spam? score=10.02 required=6.8  12661: write(2,0xa08f804,54)                     = 54 (0x36)  [12661] dbg: check:  tests=AWL,BAYES_99,DCC_CHECK,DNS_FROM_RFC_ABUSE,DNS_FROM_RFC_POST,    HEAD_LONG,SPF_HELO_PASS,SPF_PASS,UNPARSEABLE_RELAY  12661: write(2,0xa08f804,137)                    = 137 (0x89)  [12661] dbg: check:  subtests=__CT,__CTE,__CT_TEXT_PLAIN,__ENV_AND_HDR_FROM_MATCH,   __FROM_MSN_COM,__HAS_MSGID,__HAS_RCVD,__HAS_SUBJECT,__HIGHBITS,   __MIME_QP,__MIME_VERSION,__MSGID_OK_DIGITS,__MSGID_OK_HEX,   __MSGID_OK_HOST,__NONEMPTY_BODY,__RFC_IGNORANT_ENVFROM,__SANE_MSGID,    __SARE_BODY_BLNK_5_100,__SARE_HEAD_HDR_MIMEV,__SARE_HEAD_HDR_RCVD,    __SARE_HEAD_MIME_VALID,__SARE_HTML_HAS_MSG,__SARE_HTML_HAS_TO,    __SARE_META_MURTY3,__SARE_URI_ANY,__TOCC_EXISTS  12661: write(2,0xa08f804,446)                    = 446 (0x1be)  12661: __sysctl(0xbfbfe878,0x2,0xbfbfe8c0,0xbfbfe894,0x0,0x0) = 0 (0x0)  SIGNAL 10 (SIGBUS)  SIGNAL 10 (SIGBUS)  Process stopped because of:  16  process exit, rval = 10  Bus error    My wild guess is that it happens within some regular expression  evaluation, having to deal with such a long folder header line.    It is probably not a showstopper for 3.1.0, as I believe this has  been seen also in previous versions. But it may get interesting  if bad guys become aware of it.

If it doesn't go down on your system, increase the number.  For some reason the number is much lower with a default Perl installation  on FreeBSD than on Linux, but it sinks anyway.    Looks like the regexp should better be rewritten to a more stable form.      Mark  ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=4570#c3)  Loren Wilton    2005-09-06 00:53:56 UTC  ``` Subject: Re:  Mail with lots of To addresses in header triggers Bus error in Perl  BTW, there was another bus error perl bug reported a month or two back, I believe on BSD, that also had something to do with large something.  I don't recall if it was large body, long URI, or many recipients.  I htink that was eventually closed as WFM, but perhaps should be re-evaluated.  This is definitely similar in many respects to that bug.          Loren   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=4570#c4)  Justin Mason    2005-09-06 10:30:03 UTC  ``` it does sound a *lot* like that bug -- I believe there's some platform-specific issue on FreeBSD to do with pthreads:  <http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/103500> <http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=36667> ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=4570#c5)  Mark Martinec    2005-09-06 16:12:09 UTC  ``` > it does sound a *lot* like that bug -- I believe there's some   > platform-specific issue on FreeBSD to do with pthreads:...      This is part of the problem - it explains why the stack is smaller   on a default Perl 5.8.7 installation on FreeBSD compared to Linux,   but this doesn't address the core problem with the regular expression  used to parse long (un)folded header line.      Using nested subexpressions with * and + is evil and should be   carefully contemplated. Improper use can easily cause amazingly slow   backtracking or deep recursion potentially resulting in stack overflow.  While it is debatable if Perl's inability to catch stack overflow  is a bug or an implementational limitation, we have no choice but  to live with it.

Not being much of a perl expert I didn't know about the negated lookahead operator (?! and I was working on splitting the headers into lines and scanning them in a loop. Can someone see how many lines the regexp can handle on a FreeBSD system that has the lower limit? If it can handle something that is long enough that it would be too long for SpamAssassin anyway (i.e., over 256k bytes or so) then I think we could go with the regexp instead of the much longer loop code. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=4570#c9)  Justin Mason    2005-09-08 12:31:26 UTC  ``` thanks for the regexp -- it looks interesting. why does "smgi" use *both* s and m?  which one wins? ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=4570#c10)  Sidney Markowitz    2005-09-08 12:57:36 UTC  ``` Both s and m are needed for ^ and .* to each have the correct meanings in that expression. From man perlretut:  "both s and m modifiers (//sm): Treat string as a single long line, but detect multiple lines.  ’.’ matches any character, even "\n".  "^" and "$", however, are able to match at the start or end of any line within the string."  The ^ in the expression finds header strings at the beginning of lines within the multi-line string, but .* will match the embedded \n characters with the negated lookahead stoppping before the start of the next header.  ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=4570#c11)  Mark Martinec    2005-09-08 15:09:44 UTC  ``` > Can someone see how many lines the regexp can handle  > on a FreeBSD system that has the lower limit?    Almost 4 million lines (possibly more) on a FreeBSD 5.4 with a  default Perl install of 5.8.7, and 30 million on a Linux.    [talking about the following test case:    perl -e '$hdr="to"; $h="To:"; $h.=" bla\@example.com\n" for (1..4000000/3);    $h=$h.$h."From: bla to: me\n".$h;    @a=$h=~/^\Q$hdr\E:[ \t]+(.*?\n(?![ \t]))/smgi; printf("%d\n",scalar(@a))'  ]    Btw, I'm assuming the $hdr is not supposed to be a regular expression,  but a plain string, for which \Q...\E quoting is more appropriate.  ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=4570#c12)  Sidney Markowitz    2005-09-08 15:48:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3121](attachment.cgi?id=3121&action=diff "New regexp that can handle large headers without segfaulting") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=3121&action=edit "New regexp that can handle large headers without segfaulting") New regexp that can handle large headers without segfaulting  4 million is enough for me. I think we could put this in to 3.1.0 since it is 1) a simple change; and 2) closes up a potential DoS vulnerability  The \Q \E is not strictly necessary as a security measure because $hdr is set by the caller of the function, which has either hardcoded strings such as "To" or else is from the user's configuration file for the report_safe_headers option. However, it is a good idea to use \Q \E as $hdr is used as a plain string. Good catch.  I have created a patch with the proposed regexp and I'm marking this for review for 3.1.0. Committers, please vote.  I'll also check this into trunk. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=4570#c13)  Sidney Markowitz    2005-09-08 15:52:32 UTC  ``` Committed to trunk [revision 279666](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=279666).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
