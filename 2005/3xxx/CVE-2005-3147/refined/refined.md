Based on the provided bug report, here's the information regarding CVE-2005-3147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the incorrect setting of permissions for the backup root directory. Specifically, the directory's permissions were not consistently set to 0755, independent of the user's umask, which could lead to insecure permissions on the backup root directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Permissions:** The primary weakness is that the backup root directory created by `storebackup` did not have its permissions explicitly set, relying on the user's umask. This could result in overly permissive or incorrect permissions being applied.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potential Access Control Bypass:** Incorrect permissions on the backup root directory could allow unauthorized users to access or modify backup data, leading to a breach of confidentiality and integrity of the backups.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** A local user can potentially exploit this vulnerability. If the backup root directory is created with insufficient permissions, other local users might gain access to backup data.
*   **Configuration/Usage Specific:** The actual impact depends on how storebackup is configured and used. Specifically, it depends on the umask of the user executing the `storebackup` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** An attacker must be a local user on the system where `storebackup` is being used.
*   **Knowledge of Configuration:** The attacker might need to know how `storebackup` is configured in order to exploit the permission issues.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information also highlights that this CVE is part of a set of security issues fixed in `storebackup` version 1.19 (CAN-2005-3146 and CAN-2005-3148 are also mentioned).
*   The fix implemented for this vulnerability involves setting the backup root directory's permissions to 0755 explicitly.
*   The report also mentions that there is a tempfile race issue but this was not the focus of CVE-2005-3147.
