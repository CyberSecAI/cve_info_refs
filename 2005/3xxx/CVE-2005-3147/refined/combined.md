Package: storebackup
Version: 1.18.4-2
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Although it's not really mentioned in the changelog storebackup 1.19 fixed
several security problems, which are still present in Sarge, they've been
assigned CAN-2005-3150, CAN-2005-3149 and CAN-2005-3148:

Quoting upstream's changelog:
- uid and gid were not set correctly for symbolic links in the
  backups (in the files, not the description of the files)
- check for symbolic links before opening temporary files
- set permissions of backup root directory to 0755
  (independent of umask)
- uid and gid were not set correctly for symbolic links when
  restoring, instead they were changed in the file where the
  symlink pointed to

Cheers,
        Moritz

Hi

1.19-1 source and binary packages work on stable, and the
differences to 1.18.4-2 are all local bugfixes, so I figure it
doesn't make any sense to separate bugfixes from bugfixes for a
special security fix for stable. Well, we could split out
storeBackupSync, though that new script is explicitely marked as
experimental.

I don't know the details of the security issues, but might have
some time over the weekend to look at it if needed.

Security fixes for stable are typically minimal.

A quick view at the interdiff between 18.4-2 and 19-1 shows
that <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-3147>
seems fixed by this hunk:

on temporary files).

I'm not sure about <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-3148>,
which would require some more studying of the code.

Since the diff between 1.18 and 1.19 is some 1385 lines large, I
have some doubts that it only contains security corrections.  Hence,
using the new upstream version does not look like the way to go.

I've extracted the patches from the new upstream version.

This does not eliminate the vulnerability but only shortens the vulnerable
window.  An attacker can still re-create the link between the unlink()
and the open() calls.  The proper action would be to use File::Temp
or something similar.

It's the chown call.

It seems that the old version executed "chown uid gid link" which doesn't
work.  The new version executes "chown -h uid:gid link".  My manpage doesn't
document -h though.

Sounds correct, my manpage says:
-h, --no-dereference
    affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful only on
    systems that can change the ownership of a symlink)

However, I think that this hunk is missing for CAN-2005-3148:

Though the whole passing around temporary file names and
reopening them in another function seems broken to me, see
-outRandom and others. Searching for uses of $tmpdir in
StoreBackup.pl and reveals a dozend or so places where filenames
in /tmp are passed to functions which then open them writable
without any checks (though with randomized suffixes). Some of
these files are then opened again later. I'm not competent on
this whole tempfile race issue but I don't like this.

I'm now building a 1.18 package for stable with your fixes, one
day I have to replace the filename passing stuff by filehandle
passing, but this will happen in a current version.

Shall I build a deb with your patches for you?

regards, 2ri

I assume you meant 1.19-1. Closing, so it doesn't show up for etch/sid.
