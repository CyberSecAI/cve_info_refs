- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Antivirus software fails to correctly identify file types when the file's magic bytes are altered. Specifically, prepending an executable's (EXE) magic bytes ("MZ") to the beginning of other file types (like .BAT, .HTML, or .EML) can cause the antivirus scanner to misidentify the file and bypass detection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -   **File Type Misidentification:** The vulnerability stems from the antivirus engine relying heavily on the initial magic bytes of a file to determine its type. By prepending a different magic byte, the scanner is tricked into processing the file as an EXE, bypassing checks for the actual file type (.bat, .html or .eml) and any malicious content contained within.
    -   **Inadequate Scanning Logic:** The antivirus engines do not seem to perform thorough content analysis when a file is identified by a magic byte. They skip the analysis and assume the rest of the file content should match the magic byte type.
-   **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious files can evade detection by antivirus software. This allows attackers to execute malware on systems that have the vulnerable antivirus software installed. The vulnerability can also cause future viruses to be undetected.
-   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can modify a malicious file by adding the "MZ" magic bytes at the beginning. This altered file can then be distributed via various channels like email, web downloads, etc., and executed on target systems without being detected.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs the ability to modify existing malicious files by prepending specific magic bytes.
    - They need to distribute these modified files to the target system.
