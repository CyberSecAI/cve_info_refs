RELATED: CVE-2005-3797
Content:
- AlstraSoft Template Seller Pro 3.25 has vulnerabilities that allow for arbitrary code execution and SQL injections.
- The file `/include/paymentplugins/payment_paypal.php` includes and executes arbitrary PHP code by manipulating the `$config[basepath]` variable with a URL to a malicious script. This occurs if register_globals is enabled. The trailing '?' is used to bypass the intended include statement, so only the attacker's script is included.
- The file `/admin/index.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user-supplied input from the `user_name` variable into an SQL query without sanitization. Several other SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the application due to the lack of validation of user-submitted data.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to gain control of the server if safe_mode is off and there are no restrictions on command execution.
  - SQL injection allows malicious code to be inserted into the database and can lead to further compromise.
- Attack vectors:
  - For arbitrary code execution, sending a crafted GET request to `/include/paymentplugins/payment_paypal.php` with a modified `config[basepath]` parameter pointing to the attacker's malicious script.
  - For SQL injection, providing malicious input in the `user_name` field during login via `/admin/index.php`, or other similar forms.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - For arbitrary code execution, the attacker needs a web server to host a malicious script and the target server must have register_globals enabled.
  - For SQL injection, the attacker needs access to the login form and the ability to submit crafted user input.
