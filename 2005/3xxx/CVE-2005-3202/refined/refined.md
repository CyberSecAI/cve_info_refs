Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2005-3202:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization within Oracle HTML DB, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements within the database by sending a specially crafted URL to an HTMLDB user. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, as well as potentially other malicious actions within the database. The vulnerability can also allow for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker would craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript or SQL injection payloads and send it to a targeted user. When the victim accesses the URL, the malicious script or SQL is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and send them to unsuspecting users of Oracle HTML DB. No authentication is required.

**Additional details:**
The provided content includes test cases demonstrating the exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities. It also notes that the vulnerability was fixed in the Oracle Critical Patch Update (CPU) from April 2005. The advisory also mentions that Oracle did not inform Red-Database-Security about the fix, nor credit them for discovering the vulnerability.
