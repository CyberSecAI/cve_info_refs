Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the FreeWebStat 1.0 rev37 PHP application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied data in several parameters passed through GET requests. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application is vulnerable in several locations:
    *   `logdb.html`: The parameters `$site`, `$jsref`, `$jsres`, and `$jscolor` within the `pixel.php` script are vulnerable to Javascript injection.
    *   `stat.php`: The search key functionality in `stat.php` is vulnerable to XSS via the `$jsref` variable passed to `pixel.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they view the affected pages of the FreeWebStat application.
*   **Pseudo-Permanent XSS:** Because the injected data is stored in flat files, the XSS can persist and affect other users of the application who view the logs, without requiring further crafted URLs.
*   **Potential for Data Theft:** The injected JavaScript can be used to perform various malicious activities, including stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
*   **Page Rank Manipulation:** Loading an URL in $jsref can drain the PR (PageRank).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **GET Requests:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious GET requests to the `pixel.php` script, injecting JavaScript code into vulnerable parameters.
*   **Malicious URLs:** Exploiting the search key XSS involves crafting malicious URLs, including JavaScript code in the `q` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable FreeWebStat application.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web Requests:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP GET requests to construct the attack payloads and how to inject code into them.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed, the vulnerabilities are exposed directly to web requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory highlights that the vulnerability is present in `FreeWebStat 1.0 rev37`.
*   The `logdb.html` vulnerability can be exploited using anti-escape methods to bypass simple sanitization (e.g., stripping single quotes).
*   The stat.php vulnerability allows injection in the referer table and the keyword table.
*   The `stat.php` vulnerability involves exploiting the search key functionality via the jsref parameter, where the string is lowercased and + or - characters are replaced with spaces before being rendered.
