Excuse me for posting again (within minutes) but I did not properly check the other forms.
In UCP.php, when editing your profile, in several fields you can inject code into the page, just as in the SendPm.php.
EX: Input table: "URL"
'';!--"<script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)); </script>
The reason we cannot just do alert("sometext"); here is because this time our input is filtered and the quotes have 's before them (single or not).
All field areas (besides password) are useable. I could not try alias as the board would not allow me to do so.
Even the email field is vulnerable, so long as you put an email first (like dude (at) what (dot) com [email concealed]'';!--"<mycode>).
In "User Options", signature or 'saying' are not vulnerable, but URL Avatar is.
Again,
