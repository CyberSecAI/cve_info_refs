Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-3161

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `activate` parameter in `register.php` and the `cat_id` parameter in `faq.php` are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code through unsanitized parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.
- **HTTP Parameters:** The attack vectors involve manipulating the `activate` and `cat_id` parameters in HTTP requests to `register.php` and `faq.php`, respectively.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the application.
- **Knowledge of Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters (`activate` and `cat_id`).
- **"magic_quotes_gpc" Disabled:** Successful exploitation requires that the PHP setting `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled on the server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Andreas Sandblad of Secunia Research.
- The affected version is PHP-Fusion 6.00.109, and other versions may also be affected.
- A patch was released in version 6.00.110 to address these vulnerabilities.

This information provides a comprehensive overview of the SQL injection vulnerabilities, their root causes, impact, attack vectors, and required attacker capabilities. It goes beyond the placeholder CVE description by providing specific details on vulnerable parameters, required server configuration, and the patched version.
