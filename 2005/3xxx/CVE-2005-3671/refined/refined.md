  "CVE-2005-3671": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) discovered that various ISAKMP implementations, including Openswan and racoon (included in the IPsec-Tools package), behave in an anomalous way when they receive and handle ISAKMP Phase 1 packets with invalid or abnormal contents.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of ISAKMP Phase 1 packets with invalid or abnormal content",
        "Buffer overflow",
         "Format string"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could craft specific packets that would result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, and potentially arbitrary code execution, if Openswan and racoon are used in specific, weak configurations, or the IKEv1 implementation behaves in an unstable/unpredictable manner.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends specially crafted ISAKMP Phase 1 packets.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists within the IKEv1 protocol, a derivate of ISAKMP, which is used to establish secure connections for IPsec. The vulnerabilities were discovered using the PROTOS Test Tool developed by Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG). Several vendors were affected including Openswan, IPsec-Tools, Cisco, Checkpoint, Fortinet, HP, NEC, Nortel, QNX, Stonesoft, and Sun Microsystems.  Some vendors were not affected, such as Microsoft, Hitachi and Intoto"
