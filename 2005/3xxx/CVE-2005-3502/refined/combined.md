hi,
I have found a vulnerability in cerberus helpdesk latest stable version,
caused by insufficient authentication checks and leads to access of files
submitted by other users.
If you open a ticket with an attachment, it can be viewed by an url like
this:
<http://www.website.com/path-to-cerberus/attachment_send.php?file_id=XXXX&thread_id=YYYYYY>
by changing XXXX leaving YYYYYY same, you can download other attacments and
tickets submitted by other users.
As this helpdesk is mostly used in hosting sites, and most of the users add
important details like username && password this vulnerability can lead to
serious issues.
regards,
cumhur onat
