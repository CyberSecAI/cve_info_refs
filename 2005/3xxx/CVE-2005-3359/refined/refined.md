{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect module reference counting in the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) kernel module.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect decrement of the module reference count in the `atm.ko` module.",
        "Use of `THIS_MODULE` instead of `sock->ops->owner` in `sk_set_owner()`, leading to incorrect module reference."
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can cause a denial-of-service (panic) due to an incorrect module reference count, leading to a kernel crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local users can exploit the vulnerability by making specific socket calls.",
      "Specifically, calling `socket(PF_ATMPVC, SOCK_STREAM, 0)` followed by `socket(PF_ATMPVC, 0, 0)` will cause a panic due to incorrect reference counts."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the local system."
