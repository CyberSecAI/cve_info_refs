| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=175769#c0)  Doug Chapman    2005-12-14 20:14:23 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050524 Fedora/1.0.4-4 Firefox/1.0.4  Description of problem: Note, since this is a panic easily reproduced by any user I am submitting this as a security issue.  This panic is easily reproduceable on my HP ia64 systems.  I have not tried other platforms.  There appear to be incorrect error paths in the atm.ko module which can cause incorrect module reference counts and leads to a panic.  This can be reproduced by the following code:  #include <sys/socket.h> main(){         socket(PF_ATMPVC, SOCK_STREAM, 0);         socket(PF_ATMPVC, 0, 0); }   The first socket call does an extra decrement of the refcount.  If only this line is executed doing a lsmod | grep atm will show a refcount of 4294967295 (aka -1).  So doing this invalid call followed by a somewhat valid call increments it to zero which triggeres the panic.  Note that this refcount is still incorrect after the test process terminates.  Another odd and possibly related issue is if just the second line is executed the refcount is 2 (I would expect it to be 1).  Once the process calling this terminates and the socket is destroyed the refcount returns to 0 as expected.   This problem does NOT exist in the upstream 2.6.14.3 kernel however the issue with the refcount=2 still exists (which leads me to believe that part is correct for some reason I don't understand).    Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel-2.6.9-25.EL  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. compile the code listed above 2. run ./a.out as any user 3.     Additional info:   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=175769#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2006-01-11 11:50:04 UTC  ``` asssign correct CVE name, [CVE-2005-3359](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-3359)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=175769#c6)  Thomas Graf    2006-01-11 17:23:36 UTC  ``` The call to sk_set_owner() in vcc_create() is using THIS_MODULE instead of sock->ops->owner which would correspond to the correct socket family module reference.  For a module to take a reference on another module, it must be referenced by someone else first. __sock_create in net/socket.c ensures this by taking a reference on net_families[family]->owner (equals sock->ops->owner above) just before invoking the family specific ->create() callback.  I attached a patch which should fix the problem but I'm very short on time and two other issues having higher priority should be resolved first. So if someone has the opportunity to test this, I'd appreciate it.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=175769#c7)  Thomas Graf    2006-01-31 16:49:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 123918](attachment.cgi?id=123918&action=diff "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=123918&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=175769#c8)  Mark J.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

kernel security update (RHSA-2006-0493)

Original Release Date: September 1, 2006

Last Revised: September 18, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-161

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the issues fixed in the update as reported by Red
Hat:

* a flaw in the IPv6 implementation that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial of service (infinite loop and crash)* a flaw in the bridge implementation that allowed a remote user to cause
    forwarding of spoofed packets via poisoning of the forwarding* a flaw in the atm module that allowed a local user to cause a denial of
      service (panic) via certain socket calls* a flaw in the NFS client implementation that allowed a local user to cause
        a denial of service (panic) via O\_DIRECT writes* a difference in "sysretq" operation of EM64T (as opposed to Opteron)
          processors that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) upon
          return from certain system calls* a flaw in the keyring implementation that allowed a local user to cause a
            denial of service (OOPS)* a flaw in IP routing implementation that allowed a local user to cause a
              denial of service (panic) via a request for a route for a multicast IP* a flaw in the SCTP-netfilter implementation that allowed a remote user to
                cause a denial of service (infinite loop)* a flaw in the sg driver that allowed a local user to cause a denial of
                  service (crash) via a dio transfer to memory mapped (mmap) IO space* a flaw in the threading implementation that allowed a local user to cause
                    a denial of service (panic)* two missing LSM hooks that allowed a local user to bypass the LSM by using
                      readv() or writev()* a flaw in the virtual memory implementation that allowed local user to
                        cause a denial of service (panic) by using the lsof command* a directory traversal vulnerability in smbfs that allowed a local user to
                          escape chroot restrictions for an SMB-mounted filesystem via "..\\" sequences* a flaw in the ECNE chunk handling of SCTP that allowed a remote user to
                            cause a denial of service (panic)* a flaw in the handling of COOKIE\_ECHO and HEARTBEAT control chunks of SCTP
                              that allowed a remote user to cause a denial of service (panic)* a flaw in the handling of DATA fragments of SCTP that allowed a remote
                                user to cause a denial of service (infinite recursion and crash)

| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat Linux)
or remove the affected packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
