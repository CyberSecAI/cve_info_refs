Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE-2005-3490** is associated with multiple vulnerabilities in Asus Video Security software.

**Root Cause:**

*   **A] Authorization Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the decoded username:password string (Base64 encoded) during authorization on a password protected Asus Video Security web server.
*   **B] Directory Traversal:** The built-in web server is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing an attacker to access any file on the disk where the software is installed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** Improper bounds checking when handling decoded user credentials.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Lack of proper input sanitization when processing requested file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **A] Authorization Buffer Overflow:**  Remote attackers can cause a buffer overflow leading to potential arbitrary code execution or denial of service on the server.
*   **B] Directory Traversal:** Remote attackers can download arbitrary files from the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **A] Authorization Buffer Overflow:**  Sending a crafted, overly long username:password string to the web server.
*   **B] Directory Traversal:** Sending HTTP requests with dot-dot-slash (`../`) or backslash (`\`) patterns in the file path. HTTP encoding of these characters is not allowed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the machine running the vulnerable Asus Video Security software, specifically the web server component.
*   **Web Server Enabled:** The built-in web server of Asus Video Security must be enabled.
*   **Password Protected (Optional):** For directory traversal, the attacker must know the password if the server is password protected. Similarly, password protection is a requirement for exploiting the authorization buffer overflow.

**Additional Information:**

*   The software is a monitoring tool bundled with ASUS graphic cards.
*   The provided text mentions that version numbers are chaotic and that Asus did not reply to the researcher.
*   No fix was available at the time of the report.
*   The author provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) at http://aluigi.org/poc/asusvsbugs.zip
