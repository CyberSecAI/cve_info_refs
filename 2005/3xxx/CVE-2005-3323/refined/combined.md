| [Description](#c0)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 09:19:09 UTC  ``` For some reason evolution-mail segfaults.  Specifically, I see evolution  segfault when I click on mail and then the mail-settings option. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 11:06:54 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 11](show_bug.cgi?id=11 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Evolution: mailcomponent crashes when opening mailsettings") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 14:57:53 UTC  ``` test ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 19:28:48 UTC  ``` Ok, have a way of going around the issue (I think).  The problem seems to occur if the mailclient crashes before you close the program the first time the configure-database gets corrupted.   If you directly after Evolution starts for the first time exits cleanly it seems to be working as it should after that. Can this be confirmed somewhere else?   ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 20:45:26 UTC  ``` The shutdown-just-after-starting-the-first-time solution seems to work just fine.  Yayyyy!!!  Changing severity to minor, now that we have a  work-around. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 22:17:53 UTC  ``` I had this problem and had to login to my IMAP server first before opening mail settings.  I'm marking this as fixed since I think it's more of an evolution issue than anything we're doing wrong. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 23:48:45 UTC  ``` Please don't do this. I am assigned to the bug and I haven't marked it as being resolved since I want to look in to the issue. No other distributions has this problem. I wan't to make sure it's not due to our default -O3 CFLAGS. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-07 13:00:08 UTC  ``` Hmmm.  I often get a segfault when trying to print from an email, but it doesn't happen all of the time.  Worse, I don't see any pattern of when it happens. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  JP Sartre    2002-01-19 11:14:09 UTC  ``` Well, I don't know about you guys, but I segfault everytime I try to apply a new filter. Just installed gentoo, so maybe I'm missing something? I can read and delete email fine, just can't add filters. Not sure if this is related or should be a new bug?  JP ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-19 12:19:36 UTC  ``` it's probably not related.  ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-26 11:00:41 UTC  ``` The filter crash is fixed in 1.0.1-r2.  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-07 10:08:37 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 563](show_bug.cgi?id=563 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Evolution Mail Settings Broken") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-08 15:27:11 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 602](show_bug.cgi?id=602 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - evolution segfault") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Nathan Quinlan    2002-05-28 07:55:42 UTC  ``` First time installer of Gentoo, I got the iso image last week and finished  installing everything yesturday.  This Evolution bug still appears to exist.   Emerge installed Evolution 1.0.5 and since I didn't exit after doing the wizard  the evolution-mail process keeps segfaulting. After removing ~/evolution and following the work around it no longer segfaults  but this bug still happens.  Should be re-opened. ``` |  |

Package        : zope2.7
Vulnerability  : design error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-3323
Debian Bug     : 334055

A vulnerability has been discovered in zope 2.7, as Open Source web
application server, that allows remote attackers to insert arbitrary
files via include directives in reStructuredText functionality.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain zope2.7 packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.5-2sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.8-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zope2.7 package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Zope: File inclusion through RestructuredText — GLSA **200510-20**

Zope is vulnerable to a file inclusion vulnerability when exposing
RestructuredText functionalities to untrusted users.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-zope/zope** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.8**= **2.8.0**= **2.8.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.8** |

### Background

Zope is an application server that can be used to build content
management systems, intranets, portals or other custom applications.

### Description

Zope honors file inclusion directives in RestructuredText objects by
default.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious input
that would be interpreted in a RestructuredText Zope object,
potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary Zope code with the
rights of the Zope server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Zope users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose net-zope/zope
```
