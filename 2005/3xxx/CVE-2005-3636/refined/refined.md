{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The SAP Web Application Server (WAS) is vulnerable to JavaScript injection due to insufficient input validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Improper input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Error messages displayed by the application.",
        "The 'syscmd' parameter in the URL.",
        "The 'BspApplication' field in a test application (SYSTEM PUBLIC)."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the SAP WAS server. No special authentication or user privilege is explicitly required for exploiting the error page and 'syscmd' parameter vulnerabilities. The test application vector would require access to the test application, which should not be accessible on production systems.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects SAP WAS versions 6.10, 6.20, 6.40, and 7.00. Different vectors exist to exploit this. The error page vector is not applicable to versions 6.20 and above. The vendor has provided specific SAP Notes and Service Packs to resolve the vulnerabilities. The solution for SYSTEM PUBLIC involved extending the BSP compiler with a new directive forceEncode=\"HTML\"."
