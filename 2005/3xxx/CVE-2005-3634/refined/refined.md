Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3634:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the SAP Web Application Server (WAS) not properly validating user-supplied input for the `sap-exiturl` parameter. Specifically, it allows absolute URLs, which can be leveraged to redirect users to malicious websites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The SAP WAS fails to properly sanitize or validate the `sap-exiturl` parameter, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary URLs, including those pointing to external, potentially malicious, sites.
*   **Phishing Vector:** The ability to redirect users using the `sap-exiturl` parameter creates a phishing vector, as attackers can craft malicious links that appear to log users out of the application and redirect them to a fake login page to steal credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can trick users into visiting malicious websites, potentially leading to credential theft, malware infection, or other forms of social engineering attacks.
*   **User Deception:**  The exploitation can make users believe that they are logging out of the legitimate SAP application, while being redirected to a malicious page controlled by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs that include the `sap-exiturl` parameter with a malicious website as the target.  The `sap-sessioncmd=close` parameter can be used to ensure the user is logged out of the application, or to give the impression of being logged out before the redirect.
*   **Social Engineering:** The malicious URLs are likely distributed via phishing emails or other social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send the specially crafted URL to the victim.
*   **Knowledge of SAP WAS:** An attacker needs to know that the `sap-exiturl` parameter is vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects the BSP (Business Server Pages) runtime of SAP WAS.
*   SAP's solution involves disabling the parameter in older versions and using a whitelist for new versions, restricting which URLs are permitted in the `sap-exiturl` parameter.
* The `sap-sessioncmd` parameter is used to log the user out of the system, even if not logged in.
