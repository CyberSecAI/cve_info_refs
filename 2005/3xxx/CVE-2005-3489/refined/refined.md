The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Asus Video Security software: a buffer overflow and a directory traversal vulnerability.

**A] Authorization Buffer-Overflow:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way the software handles the decoded (base64) username:password string sent to the web server when authorization is enabled.
*  **Weakness/Vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs when the software processes the base64 decoded username/password string, suggesting insufficient bounds checking on the input data.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting memory.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted username:password string to the web server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be able to reach the web server and send a crafted authorization request. Authorization must be enabled for this vulnerability to be present.

**B] Directory Traversal:**

*   **Root Cause:** The built-in web server is vulnerable to directory traversal due to improper input sanitization.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The web server allows the use of "dot-dot-slash" (`../`) and backslash (`\`) patterns within URLs to access files outside of the intended directory. The server does not allow HTTP encoded characters, so the characters must be sent directly.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can download any file on the disk where the software is installed, leading to data disclosure.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending specially crafted URLs containing directory traversal sequences.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must have network access to the web server. If the server has password protection, the attacker would need to know the correct password.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities are present in Asus Video Security versions <= 3.5.0.0.
*   The built-in web server is disabled by default, meaning these vulnerabilities are only exploitable if the user has manually enabled the web server.
*   The vendor did not reply to the researcher and no fix is available.
*   A proof of concept code is available at `http://aluigi.altervista.org/poc/asusvsbugs.zip`.
