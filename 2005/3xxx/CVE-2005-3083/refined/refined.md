Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `page` parameter of the `index.php` file. Specifically, the application fails to properly encode or sanitize HTML special characters, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access a page containing the vulnerable input. This can be used to:
* Steal cookies, potentially hijacking user sessions.
* Redirect users to malicious websites.
* Deface the website.
* Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
* Deliver further attacks.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL, specifically by inserting a malicious javascript payload in the `page` parameter in the GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious script, and the victim needs to visit that URL.
