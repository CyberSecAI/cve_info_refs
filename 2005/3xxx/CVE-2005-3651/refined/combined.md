Ethereal OSPF Protocol Dissector Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
iDefense Security Advisory 12.09.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=349&type=vulnerabilities
December 9, 2005
I. BACKGROUND
Ethereal is a full featured open source network protocol analyzer.
For more information, see http://www.ethereal.com/
II. DESCRIPTION
Remote exploitation of an input validation vulnerability in the OSPF
protocol dissectors within Ethereal, as included in various vendors
operating system distributions, could allow attackers to crash the
vulnerable process or potentially execute arbitrary code.
The affected Ethereal component is used to analyse Open Shortest Path
First (OSPF) Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), as specified in RFC-2178.
The vulnerability specifically exists due to no bounds checking being
performed in the dissect\_ospf\_v3\_address\_prefix() function. This
function takes user-supplied binary data and attempts to convert it into
a human readable string. This function uses a fixed length buffer on
the stack to store the constructed string but performs no checks on the
length of the input. If the generated output length from the input
exceeds the size of the buffer, a stack-based overflow occurs.
III. ANALYSIS
Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to perform a DoS against
a running instance of Ethereal and may, under certain conditions,
potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code. As the overflow
string is generated from a format string converting binary values into
their hexadecimal (base 16) equivalent characters, it can contain only a
limited subset of all possible characters, and the length of an
overflow is only able to be controlled to within the three characters.
This may prevent exploit ability on some platforms; however, it may be
possible that these constraints will not prevent exploitation on
others.
IV. DETECTION
iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the
ethereal-0.10.12 RPM from Red Hat Fedora Core 3. It is suspected that
previous versions containing the OSPF dissector code are also
vulnerable.
V. WORKAROUND
Disable the OSPF packet dissector in Ethereal by performing the
following actions as the user invoking Ethereal, typically root.
Create the .ethereal directory:
# mkdir ~/.ethereal
You can safely ignore the following error:
mkdir: cannot create directory '/root/.ethereal': File exists
Add the OSPF dissector to the list of protocols to ignore.
# echo ospf >> ~/.ethereal/disabled\_protos
This workaround will prevent Ethereal from parsing the contents of OSPF
packets, which prevents exposure to the vulnerability.
VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
A source patch is available from the main ethereal SVN Repository:
http://anonsvn.ethereal.com/viewcvs/viewcvs.py/trunk/epan/dissectors/
packet-ospf.c?rev=16507&view=markup
VII. CVE INFORMATION
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2005-3651 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for
security problems.

BugTraq ID     : 15794
Debian Bug     : 342911

A buffer overflow has been discovered in ethereal, a commonly used
network traffic analyser that causes a denial of service and may
potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code.

For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody14.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.10-2sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Ethereal: Buffer overflow in OSPF protocol dissector â GLSA **200512-06**

Ethereal is missing bounds checking in the OSPF protocol dissector that
could lead to abnormal program termination or the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/ethereal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.13-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.13-r2** |

### Background

Ethereal is a feature-rich network protocol analyzer. It provides
protocol analyzers for various network flows, including one for Open
Shortest Path First (OSPF) Interior Gateway Protocol.

### Description

iDEFENSE reported a possible overflow due to the lack of bounds
checking in the dissect\_ospf\_v3\_address\_prefix() function, part of the
OSPF protocol dissector.

### Impact

An attacker might be able to craft a malicious network flow that
would crash Ethereal. It may be possible, though unlikely, to exploit
this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running Ethereal, which could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ethereal users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.13-r2"
```
