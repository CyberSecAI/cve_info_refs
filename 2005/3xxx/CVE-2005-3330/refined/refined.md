Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in the marc.info content, which aligns with CVE-2005-3330:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Snoopy PHP Webclient, specifically in the `_httpsrequest` function, uses the PHP `exec` function with unchecked user-controlled input when handling SSL protected URLs. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unchecked User Input:** The `_httpsrequest` function takes the URL directly from user input (through the function call) without any sanitization, escaping or filtering before passing it to the `exec` function.
- **Command Injection:** The use of `exec` function, without prior input validation,  makes it possible to inject and execute operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the webserver, with the privileges of the webserver user. This could lead to complete server compromise, data theft, defacement, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL and passing it as a GET parameter, which is then directly used by the vulnerable application to fetch the webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of Snoopy Implementation:** The attacker needs to know that Snoopy is being used and how it is implemented to pass user supplied URLs to the vulnerable function. Specifically they need to find a vulnerable implementation using snoopy, as it is not directly exploitable in the library itself.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is not in the Snoopy class file itself but in implementations that pass unchecked URLs to Snoopy.
- An example code snippet and proof-of-concept URL were provided showing a method of exploiting this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in Snoopy versions 1.2 and earlier.
- The vendor was notified and a patch (version 1.2.1) was released.
