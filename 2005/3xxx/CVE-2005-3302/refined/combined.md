Package        : blender
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-3302 CVE-2005-4470
BugTraq ID     : 15981
Debian Bugs    : 330895 344398

Several vulnerabilities have been discoverd in in blender, a very fast
and versatile 3D modeller/renderer.  The Common Vulnerability and
Exposures Project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-3302

    Joxean Koret discovered that due to missing input validation a
    provides script is vulnerable to arbitrary command execution.

CVE-2005-4470

    Damian Put discovered a buffer overflow that allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
    arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.36-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.40-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your blender package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: blender: Arbitrary code execution when importing a .bvh file
Package: blender
Version: 2.36-1
Severity: grave
Justification: user security hole

The bvh_import.py script supplied with the current Debian Stable and (I
think) unstable versions of Blender is vulnerable to arbitrary code
execution.

The problem was corrected at 2005/01/22 in the CVS but the main package
doesn't come with the fixed script.

Attached goes the e-mail sended to the Blender people,  one
working exploit to test the vulnerability under Debian, and 2 proof of
concepts.

oldstable (2.23-0.1) isn't affected as it shipped a version of blender
that didn't include this script yet (and was non-free anyway).

stable (2.36-1) is affected, I've attached a naive patch to remove all
'eval's in the script, which in fact basically is what upstream did.
Please see
<<http://projects.blender.org/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/blender/release/scripts/bvh_import.py.diff?r1=1.4&r2=1.5&cvsroot=bf-blender>>
for upstream details.

testing isn't affected anymore as blender has been removed from
testing due to general bugginess.

unstable (2.36-1 on alpha mips mipsel, 2.37a-1 on all other archs) is
partially affected: while 2.37a includes the upstream fix for this
problem this version hasn't been built on all archs due to bug#333958.

This time the patch is dpatch'yfied, and I'll also attach a patch that
is closer to upstream, but includes more changes to the code.

Package: blender
Version: 2.37a-1

Dear Security Team,

as this package's maintainer hasn't shown any visible reaction to this
issue I now try to take care...

I can confirm that this particular vulnerability could trick a user
into executing arbitrary commands with his rights. All an attacker has
to do is to provide a specially crafted bvh file (used for Motion
Capture data) for the user to import into a blender scene, and all
commands contained therein will be executed in the user's environment.
The demo exploit attached to Joxean's mail works under blender-2.36.

Oldstable (2.23-0.1) isn't affected as it shipped a version of blender
that didn't include this script yet (and was in non-free).

Stable (2.36-1) is affected, I've attached two patches that remove all
'eval's in the script, which in fact basically is what upstream did.
The first patch (CVE-2005-3302_upstream_dpatch.diff) essentially
contains what upstream did to resolve this issue, while the second
patch (CVE-2005-3302_dpatch.diff) contains what I considered to be a
minimal set of changes to remove this particular vulnerability.
Please see
<<http://projects.blender.org/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/blender/release/scripts/bvh_import.py.diff?r1=1.4&r2=1.5&cvsroot=bf-blender>>
for upstream details.
I can confirm that these changes prevent the exploit of this
vulnerability, tested on both blender-2.36 and 2.37a

Testing isn't affected anymore as blender has been removed from
Testing due to general bugginess.

Unstable was partially affected: while 2.37a-1 already included the
upstream fix for this problem this version hadn't been built on all
archs due to bug#333958. However, this FTBFS has been resolved as of
2.37a-1.1, so right now all versions currently present in Unstable are
_not_ vulnerable. Consequently I now close this bug for the
corresponding version in Unstable with this mail.

Please issue an update for Stable when you think it is due time.

HTH,
Flo
