- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the FileZilla Server Terminal (interface) when processing long USER commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The FileZilla Server Terminal has a buffer overflow vulnerability. Sending an overly long string via the USER command can cause a buffer overflow in the application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can crash the FileZilla Server Terminal process.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a series of USER commands with increasing lengths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FileZilla server and send FTP commands to trigger the vulnerability within the FileZilla Server Terminal application (interface). The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
