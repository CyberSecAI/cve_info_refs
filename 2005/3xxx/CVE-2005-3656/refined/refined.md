Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `mod_auth_pgsql` module for Apache2 has format string vulnerabilities in its error logging functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The module fails to validate strings before passing them to the syslog function, leading to format string vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running the Apache2 server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- An attacker can send specially crafted login names to trigger the vulnerabilities in the error logging functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Apache server.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
- The `mod_auth_pgsql` module is an Apache2 module for authenticating users against a PostgreSQL database.
- The vulnerability is in the error logging functions where user-supplied input is passed to syslog without proper sanitization, enabling format string attacks.

**Additional Details:**
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200601-05) provides specific information about the affected versions (less than 2.0.3) and the unaffected versions (2.0.3 or greater) of the `www-apache/mod_auth_pgsql` package.
-  The advisory also references FrSIRT ADV-2006-0070, providing an additional resource.
- The module's developer, Giuseppe Tanzilli, released version 2.0.3 on 2006-01-05 to address this vulnerability.
