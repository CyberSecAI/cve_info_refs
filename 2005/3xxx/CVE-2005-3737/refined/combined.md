How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Inkscape: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200511-22**

A vulnerability has been identified that allows a specially crafted SVG
file to exploit a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code
when opened.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/inkscape** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.43** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.43** |

### Background

Inkscape is an Open Source vector graphics editor using the W3C
standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format.

### Description

Joxean Koret has discovered that Inkscape incorrectly allocates
memory when opening an SVG file, creating the possibility of a buffer
overflow if the SVG file being opened is specially crafted.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user into opening a maliciously crafted
SVG file, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code on a machine
with the privileges of the user running Inkscape.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Inkscape users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/inkscape-0.43"
```

```
```
Subject: inkscape: Arbitrary code execution opening a file
Package: inkscape
Version: 0.41-4.99.sarge0
Severity: grave
Justification: user security hole

Inkscape is vulnerable to, almost, one buffer overflow that may allow
arbitrary code execution. I contacted the Inkscape team but, at the
moment, there is no patch for the issue.

Attached goes a Proof Of Concept.

NOTE: I think the problem may not be exploitable because you need to
write a shellcode using only valid XML characters.

Regards,
Joxean Koret

Thanks for your report. I forwarded it to the developer's mailing list.
On my PowerBook inkscape simply crashed when opening your file, I don't
know what it should do on a i386 box. I tried to open it in vim, but
there it causes troubles too, at least for the syntax highlighter.

I also tried it with sodipodi, but could not see an effect. It seems to
open cleanly.

With best wishes,

Wolfi

This is only a P.O.C. I have no working exploit at the moment for the

Yes, I believe that's the bug that prompted the new point release.  I've
attached the patch for the 0.42 branch.

It's worth noting that (except for incrementing the version number in
the about dialog, etc, and some changes to the distributed Windows
makefiles) this is the only difference between 0.42.2 and 0.42.3.

I believe the patch can also be applied to the 0.41 line as well (the
same change is present in 0.41.1).  I don't believe it's relevent to
0.40.

Hi!

You wrote two times in the changelog that this issue is resolved:

Changes:
 inkscape (0.43-1) unstable; urgency=high

   * urgency=high since this version fixes the buffer overflow discovered by
     Joxean Koret (see [CVE-2005-3737](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3737), debian bug 330894).

Changes:
 inkscape (0.42.2+0.43pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

   * Just for the record: inkscape version 0.42 and newer is not vulnerable to
     the security bug mentioned in Bug #321501.

So I'm wondering: why can't this bug be closed, with the appropriate version tag?
This would also help migrating inkscape into testing, which it cannot do till this bug remains open...

Thanks,

Guido

These are not the same bug; 321501 is a tempfile bug, and 330894 is a buffer
overflow.  But you're right, based on the available information this bug
should be marked as closed in unstable.

Yes, you are right. My thinking was that I close this bug when it is
fixed in stable, too. But I see that this was wrong.

Thanks Steve for closing, I hope the security team will upload the fixed
version I sent them to sarge.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : inkscape
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-3737 CVE-2005-3885
BugTraq ID     : 14522
Debian Bug     : 321501 330894

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Inkscape, a
vector-based drawing program.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-3737

    Joxean Koret discovered a buffer overflow in the SVG parsing
    routines that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2005-3885

    Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña noticed that the ps2epsi extension
    shell script uses a hardcoded temporary file making it vulnerable
    to symlink attacks.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain inkscape packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.41-4.99.sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.42.2+0.43pre1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your inkscape package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
