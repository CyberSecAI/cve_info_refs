Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in Gadu-Gadu instant messenger:

**Vulnerability #1: Image Sending - Device File Injection (version <= 7.20)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows the sender to specify the filename when sending an image. The receiver's application uses this filename directly to save the image on disk.
*   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of the filename allows for special device names (like `LPT1:`, `AUX:`) to be used.
*   **Impact:** Writing to special device files can cause:
    *   Data sent to a printer port (`LPT1:`).
    *   Denial of service by blocking the thread responsible for message display, receive and send (`AUX:` sent multiple times).
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending an image with a specially crafted filename.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker must be able to send messages/files to a victim using the Gadu-Gadu messenger.

**Vulnerability #2: Image Sending - Stack-Based Buffer Overflow (version 7.20 and possibly older)**

*   **Root Cause:** When an image is received, the application copies the filename into a fixed-size buffer on the stack after prepending "imgcache\" to it.
*   **Weakness:** The check for the filename length is performed before prepending "imgcache\", leading to a buffer overflow when the image name length is between 192 and 200 bytes (inclusive).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service is possible due to stack corruption. While the presence of a stack canary makes exploitation harder, a DoS can still be achieved.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending an image with a filename between 192 and 200 bytes in length.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker must be able to send messages/files to a victim using the Gadu-Gadu messenger.

**Vulnerability #3: Direct Connection - Memory Exhaustion (version 7.20 and possibly older)**

*   **Root Cause:** The direct connection protocol, based on CTCP and DCC packets, allocates memory based on the received size from a DCC packet but doesn't always free the allocated memory if it receives a bad code.
*   **Weakness:**  A malicious sender can send DCC packets with specific codes that trigger memory allocation on the victim's side without being released, leading to memory exhaustion.
*    **Impact:** Denial of service due to memory exhaustion.
*    **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted DCC packets over a direct connection.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to establish a direct connection with the victim over the network.

**Vulnerability #4: Direct Connection - Thread Flooding (version 7.20 and possibly older)**

*   **Root Cause:** DCC packets with specific codes trigger error messages resulting in window pop-ups, and each packet creates two new threads.
*    **Weakness:** The application does not properly handle specific DCC codes, leading to the creation of threads for each error message and lacks rate limiting.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Annoyance through pop-up message spam.
    *   Denial of service due to excessive thread creation.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending multiple DCC packets with specific codes that trigger error messages.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to establish a direct connection with the victim over the network.

**Vulnerability #5: GG Moniker - Instance Flooding (version 7.20 and possibly older)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `gg:` URI handler is used to invoke the Gadu-Gadu application.
*   **Weakness:** Repeatedly invoking the `gg:` handler can result in multiple instances of the application being launched.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application crash
    *   Potential configuration loss due to improper concurrent access.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** Including multiple `gg:` URI references in a web page that is opened by the victim.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a web page to the victim.

**Vulnerability #6: GG Phonecalls - Unauthorized Call Initiation (version 7.20 and possibly older)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `EasycallLite.oce` ActiveX object can be instantiated from a web page.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of user interaction or prompt prior to the call being initiated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping on the user via phone calls without their consent, if they have a microphone.
*   **Attack Vector:** Creating a malicious webpage that instantiates the `EasycallLite.oce` object and makes a call without user consent.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a web page to the victim.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

The vulnerabilities include file injection through image sending, a stack-based buffer overflow via filename manipulation, resource exhaustion via direct connections and multiple thread creation, denial of service through multiple program instances launched via a custom URL handler, and finally the possibility of unauthorized phone calls by utilizing an ActiveX object. These vulnerabilities can lead to DoS, data exfiltration, and potentially code execution.
