Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3286:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the FWDRV driver of Kerio Personal Firewall and Kerio Server Firewall. The driver parses the Process Environment Block (PEB) of programs attempting to connect to the internet. However, it does not verify if the memory location of the PEB is accessible before attempting to read it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of access control check: The driver fails to check if the memory region containing the PEB is accessible before attempting to read from it. Specifically, it doesn't check for `PAGE_NOACCESS` or `PAGE_GUARD` protection flags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can set the protection of the PEB memory region to `PAGE_NOACCESS` or `PAGE_GUARD`. When the FWDRV driver attempts to access the PEB, it will trigger a fatal exception, resulting in a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) and crashing the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker must have local access to the machine to manipulate the memory protection of the PEB.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user: The attacker needs to be able to execute code with sufficient privileges to modify memory protections.
- Ability to set memory protection: The attacker needs to have the ability to set the memory protection of the targeted process's PEB.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was tested and confirmed on Kerio Personal Firewall 4 (4.2.0) and Kerio Server Firewall version 1.1.1. It is likely that earlier versions are also affected.
- A Proof of Concept (POC) code was released to the vendor.
- The provided data gives more details than the basic CVE description by describing the specific driver and code location of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has been classified as low risk, due to the need for local access.
