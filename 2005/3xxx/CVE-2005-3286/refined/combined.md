Kerio Technologies Kerio Personal Firewall and Kerio Server
Firewall FWDRV driver
Local denial of service
by Piotr Bania <bania.piotr (at) gmail (dot) com [email concealed]>
http://pb.specialised.info
Original location:
http://pb.specialised.info/all/adv/kerio-fwdrv-dos-adv.txt
Severity: Low (local machine denial of service -
BSOD)
Software affected: Tested on Kerio Personal Firewall 4
(4.2.0) and KerioServerFirewall
version 1.1.1, however it is highly
possible that earlier versions
are also vulnerable.
I. BACKGROUND
From kerio.com website:
"Kerio Personal Firewall represents smart, easy-to-use personal
security technology that fully protects personal computers
against hackers and internal misuse"
"Kerio ServerFirewall offers IT and security administrators a
powerful and easy-to-use tool to protect their server systems
from worms, buffer-overflow and other internet security
threats."
II. DESCRIPTION
FWDRV driver (core part of the firewall system) monitors all
programs that are trying to connect to the internet. While doing
necessary checks, FWDRV parses the Process Environment Block
(PEB) like the code shows:
;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
.text:0041C04E mov ecx, [ebp+var\_4] ; ECX = PEB base
.text:0041C051 mov edx, [ecx+0Ch] ; EDX = PEB\_LDR\_DATA
;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
However while parsing the PEB FWDRV doesn't check if the memory
with Process Environment Block is accessible. It means that if
attacker will set PAGE\_NOACCESS or PAGE\_GUARD protection to the
PEB block the FWDRV will cause an fatal exception and the
machine will crash.
III. IMPACT
Sample scenario:
Executing connect api function with previously PAGE\_NOACCESS
protection set to Process Environment Block will cause an local
machine crash.
IV. POC CODE
Sample POC code was released to vendor.

Piotr Bania

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
