| [Description](#c0)  Michael Davey    2005-10-19 14:35:46 UTC  ``` A new release of TikiWiki is now available on SourceForge.net: version 1.9.1.1 for the 1.9 -Sirius- branch.  This maintainance release includes fixes for a recently identified security flaw.   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.     1.9.1.1 is available as a patch tarball to be applied over version 1.9.1 and as a complete distribution.  Additionally, the Tiki community have recently marked the 1.9 branch as stable and fit for production use, thus 1.9.1.1 should ideally be the default (unmasked) target for an emerge of the tikiwiki package.  If you need any assistance preparing or testing the ebuild, please do drop in on <irc://irc.freenode.net/#tikiwiki> and ask - we are a friendly bunch ;) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Michael Davey    2005-10-19 14:43:27 UTC  ``` <<http://tikiwiki.org/art118>> for more information <<http://tikiwiki.org/Download>> for files download  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michael Davey    2005-10-19 14:45:15 UTC  ``` Reassigning to webapps team.  Please email security@tikiwiki.org if you need further security information.  Cheers, --  Michael a TikiWiki developer  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-10-19 22:39:36 UTC  ``` URL removed.

A [new release](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64258&package_id=112134 "External link") of ))TikiWiki(( is now available on SourceForge.net: version [1.9.1.1](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64258&package_id=112134 "External link") for the 1.9 -Sirius- branch.

This maintenance release includes fixes for a recently identified security flaw.

Additionally, we have taken the opportunity to conduct a security audit of the 1.9 TikiWiki codebase and make some improvements to the security admin panel and file fingerprinting database (secdb).

System administrators might find the following general security advice useful in improving the security of their server:

* consider using an egress firewall on Internet-facing sites, to protect your OS against connect-back backdoor exploits
* make sure that every partition with a directory that unprivileged users such as apache can write to, is protected with the noexec mount option

# TikiWiki: XSS vulnerability — GLSA **200510-23**

TikiWiki is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/tikiwiki** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.9.1.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.1.1** |

### Background

TikiWiki is a web-based groupware and content management system (CMS),
using PHP, ADOdb and Smarty.

### Description

Due to improper input validation, TikiWiki can be exploited to perform
cross-site scripting attacks.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit this to inject and execute malicious
script code or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials,
potentially compromising the victim's browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All TikiWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/tikiwiki-1.9.1.1"
```

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.
