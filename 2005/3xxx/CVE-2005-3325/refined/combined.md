How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : acidlab
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-3325
CERT advisory  :
BugTraq ID     : 15199
Debian Bug     : 335998 336788

Remco Verhoef has discovered a vulnerability in acidlab, Analysis
Console for Intrusion Databases, and in acidbase, Basic Analysis and
Security Engine, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct
SQL injection attacks.

The maintainers of Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) in Debian,
of which BASE is a fork off, after a security audit of both BASE and ACID
have determined that the flaw found not only affected the base_qry_main.php (in
BASE) or acid_qry_main.php (in ACID) component but was also found in other
elements of the consoles due to improper parameter validation and filtering.

All the SQL injection bugs and Cross Site Scripting bugs found have been
fixed in the Debian package, closing all the different attack vendors detected.

For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6b20-2.1.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6b20-10.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6b20-13 and in version 1.2.1-1 of acidbase.

We recommend that you upgrade your acidlab and acidbase package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: acidbase: SQL injection vulnerability still present
Date: Tue, 01 Nov 2005 15:11:52 +0100
```
Package: acidbase
Severity: critical
Tags: security
Justification: root security hole

The ImportHTTPVar() function (defined in acid_state_common.inc and
include/base_state_common.inc) is defined as:

function ImportHTTPVar($var_name, $valid_data = "", $exception = "")

and calls CleanVariable($tmp, $valid_data, $exception), which should be used
to clean up of invalid characters. However, that one is defined as:

function CleanVariable($item, $valid_data, $exception = "")
{
   return $item;
(...)
}

So SQL injection (as well as XSS) are possible since:

- calls to extract information from the HTTP request does not use
  ImportHTTPVar() with $valid_data set.
- CleanVariable() does not check against $valid_data

Description:
 acidbase   - Basic Analysis and Security Engine
Closes: [336788](bugreport.cgi?bug=336788)
Changes:
 acidbase (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   [ David Gil ]
   * New upstream release.
 .
   [ Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a ]
   * SECURITY FIX:
     Add proper filtering in all ImportHTTP variables using either the new
     functions to check for numeric/alphanumeric chars or the filterSql()
     function to prevent SQL injection attacks. This patch fixes [CVE-2005-3325](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3325)
     but also other attack vectors not mentioned in the initial advisory
     (<http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2005/2188>)
     (Closes: #[336788](bugreport.cgi?bug=336788))
   * To reduce the risk of possible vulnerabilities in the code, made the
     default apache.conf allow access only from localhost and document this
     in the (new) README.Debian file
   * Added dependency on "debconf | debconf-2.0"
   * Added alternative DNS lookups at Sam Spade
   * Changed default alert database in debconf prompt to 'snort_log'
