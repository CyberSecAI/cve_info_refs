Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-3620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   VMware ESX Server stores user passwords in cleartext within server log files. These log files have read permissions for all local users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** Passwords are not encrypted or hashed when recorded in the log files.
*   **Inadequate File Permissions:** Log files containing the sensitive information are world-readable, which means any local user can access them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Exposure:** Local users can read the passwords of other users who have changed their passwords via the web interface.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user could potentially use the exposed passwords to gain unauthorized access to other accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have local access to the server where VMware ESX is running to be able to read the log files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the affected VMware ESX Server.
*   **Basic File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to navigate the file system and read the relevant log files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to certain versions of VMware ESX Server prior to specific patch releases:
    *   VMware ESX prior to 2.5.3 upgrade patch 2
    *   VMware ESX prior to 2.1.3 upgrade patch 1
    *   VMware ESX prior to 2.0.2 upgrade patch 1

*   The vulnerability is related to passwords changed through the web interface.
*   The CERT vulnerability note assigns a severity metric of 0.31, which is a low score, but the actual impact could be quite high depending on the level of access of the compromised accounts.
