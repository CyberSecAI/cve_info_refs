Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user input in the "Subject" field when creating new threads.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation/sanitization, allowing injection of HTML and JavaScript.
*   **Impact:**  HTML and JavaScript injection can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS), which could be used to steal cookies or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Attack vector:** Malicious input within the thread subject field.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to create a thread in the affected forum.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Similar to Vulnerability 1, the Reputation system also fails to sanitize user input.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation/sanitization in the reputation system, allowing injection of HTML and JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Similar to vulnerability 1, HTML and JavaScript injection could lead to XSS, with the injected code rendering on the UserCP page.
*   **Attack vector:** Malicious input within the reputation system feature.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to interact with the reputation system.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root cause:** Insecure design of the PM inbox form, specifically the "delete" and "move" options.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper access control when specifying target PM IDs, allowing an attacker to access and manipulate arbitrary PMs.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially read, move, or delete any PM by knowing or guessing PM IDs across any inbox.
*   **Attack vector:** Manipulation of the inbox form when deleting or moving messages
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Any user with the ability to access the PM inbox feature, and knowledge of PM IDs
