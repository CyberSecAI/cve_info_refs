RESOLUTION

Until patches are provided to resolve the issue avoid using the
potentially vulnerable versions of /usr/bin/X11/xterm.

One solution is to remove the patches listed in the Background
section (above).  The patches listed are the only patches
containing the potentially vulnerable xterm.

An alternative to removing the patches is to use
/usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm.

For example:

cp /usr/bin/X11/xterm /usr/bin/X11/xterm.nosuid
chmod 555 /usr/bin/X11/xterm.nosuid
cp /usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm /usr/bin/X11/xterm

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
Remove the patches listed in the Background section
or use /usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm.
