{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 'gd' image processing and cURL modules did not properly check processed file names against the 'open_basedir' and 'safe_mode' restrictions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Safe mode bypass",
      "open_basedir bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Circumvention of 'open_basedir' and 'safe_mode' restrictions, potentially leading to unauthorized file access or other security breaches.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation via specially crafted filenames processed by 'gd' and cURL modules."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability through a web application that uses 'gd' or cURL and processes user-controlled filenames. An attacker needs the ability to trigger the processing of maliciously crafted filenames using these modules."
