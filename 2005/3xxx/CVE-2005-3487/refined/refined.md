Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2005-3487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is the insecure use of `vsprintf` with user-controlled input within several functions of the Scorched 3D game server. Specifically:
    *   `GLConsole::addLine`
    *   `ServerCommon::sendString*`
    *   `ServerCommon::serverLog`
*   These functions use static buffers of different sizes (1024, 2048, and 10000) and are vulnerable to both format string and buffer overflow attacks.
*   Additionally a buffer overflow vulnerability exists in ComsMessageHandler.cpp when creating error messages via `sprintf`.
*   Crashes can be triggered via long values, like a big UniqueID, in the Logger.cpp.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** User-supplied input is passed directly as the format string argument to `vsprintf` allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a crash.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The use of static buffers and `sprintf`/`vsprintf` without proper bounds checking leads to buffer overflows if input exceeds buffer sizes.
*   **Integer Overflow:** The server can be frozen by providing a negative value for the number of players (`numplayers`), causing an infinite loop when the game server tries to add new players.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the server user.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   The server can be crashed via format string exploits, buffer overflows, and by providing long values such as a large UniqueID.
    *   The server can be frozen with an infinite loop due to negative `numplayers` value.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Vulnerabilities are exploited through network communication with the game server.
    *   Sending crafted messages/commands which contains format string specifiers
    *   Sending messages/commands that are longer than the allocated buffer.
    *   Sending a negative value for `numplayers`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable game server.
*   **Understanding of Game Protocol:** The attacker needs to understand the game protocol to send specially crafted messages, commands, and values.
*   **Optional Password:** For some exploits, like the negative numplayers freeze, the attacker might need the server password if it's protected.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Scorched 3D versions 39.1 and earlier.
*   The exploit is remote, targeting the game server, not clients.
*   The Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 200511-12) and Luigi Auriemma's original advisory provide the most detail about the vulnerabilities.
*   The exploit code is available at `http://aluigi.org/poc/scorchbugs.zip`.
