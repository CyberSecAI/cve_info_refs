How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Scorched 3D: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200511-12**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Scorched 3D allow a remote attacker to deny
service or execute arbitrary code on game servers.

### Affected packages

| Package | **games-strategy/scorched3d** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **39.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **40** |

### Background

Scorched 3D is a clone of the classic "Scorched Earth" DOS game, adding
features like a 3D island environment and Internet multiplayer
capabilities.

### Description

Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple flaws in the Scorched 3D game
server, including a format string vulnerability and several buffer
overflows.

### Impact

A remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to crash a game
server or execute arbitrary code with the rights of the game server
user. Users not running a Scorched 3D game server are not affected by
these flaws.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Scorched 3D users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-strategy/scorched3d-40"
```

2) Bugs
=======
---------------------------------------------------------------
A] format string and buffer-overflow in addLine and SendString\*
---------------------------------------------------------------
The game is affected by many format string and buffer-overflow bugs
which are "mainly" located in the GLConsole::addLine, all the
ServerCommon::sendString\* and ServerCommon::serverLog functions.
All these functions use vsprintf with static buffers of various lengths
(like 1024, 2048 and 10000) and some of them are called from
instructions that pass the user's input (like messages or commands and
values) directly as format argument opening the server also to format
string attacks.
--------------------------------------------
B] server freeze through negative numplayers
--------------------------------------------
Scorched 3D clients use a strange field called numplayers used for
creating a specific number of players in the server (although the
client is only one).
The problem is in the usage of a negative numplayers value which first
bypasses the (signed) check used in the code and then freezes the
server that enters in an almost endless loop located in
ServerConnectHandler.cpp:
for (unsigned int i=0; i<message.getNoPlayers(); i++)
{
addNextTank(destinationId,
ipAddress,
uniqueId.c\_str(),
message.getHostDesc(),
false);
}
If the server is protected with a password the attacker must know the
right keyword.
-------------------------------------
C] ComsMessageHandler buffer-overflow
-------------------------------------
Exists a buffer-overflow in the creation of the following error
messages in ComsMessageHandler.cpp:
char buffer[1024];
sprintf(buffer, "Failed to find message type handler \"%s\"",
messageType.c\_str());
and
char buffer[1024];
sprintf(buffer, "Failed to handle message type \"%s\"",
messageType.c\_str());
For exploiting the bug is enough to use a command longer than the
buffer used by these instructions.
------------------------------------------------------------
D] various crashes and possible code execution in Logger.cpp
------------------------------------------------------------
When an attacker uses some long values, like a big UniqueID, the server
crashes immediately.
The problem is located in some of the functions of Logger.cpp and seems
also possible to execute remote code.
In one of the ways I have found to exploit the bug is needed to know
the keyword of the server if uses a password, but could exist other
better ways to exploit the vulnerability.
