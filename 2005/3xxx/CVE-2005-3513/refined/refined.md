The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in VUBB alpha rc1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Path Disclosure.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when generating a page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script code into the web page.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Improper input sanitization, specifically within the URL parameters.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable website in the target user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within a query parameter (`t=`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be remote and needs to entice a victim to click on the malicious URL.

**Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application displays an error message that includes sensitive information about the server's installation path. This occurs when a user provides a crafted URL
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of proper error handling or verbose error messaging that does not strip sensitive server information.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Exposure of the server's file system path, which can aid attackers in further reconnaissance for other vulnerabilities.
*  **Attack Vectors:** A specially crafted URL that causes an error message to be displayed (`f=>'`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be remote and only needs a browser to trigger the vulnerability.
