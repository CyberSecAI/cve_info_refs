```
Root cause of vulnerability:
  - Multiple vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient input validation and insecure handling of data in phpAdsNew.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Full Path Disclosure: Several files reveal the installation path of phpAdsNew. Specifically, create.php discloses the path during scan initiation, and revisions.txt reveals modified and added files, including their hashes. Other vulnerable files include admin/lib-updates.inc.php, admin/lib-targetstats.inc.php, admin/lib-size.inc.php, admin/lib-misc-stats.inc.php, admin/lib-hourly-hosts.inc.php, admin/lib-hourly.inc.php, admin/lib-history.inc.php, and admin/graph-daily.php.
  - SQL Injection: The sessionID is not properly validated before being used in an SQL query in logout.php / lib-sessions.inc.php, leading to SQL injection vulnerability if magic_quotes_gpc is off.
  - HTTP Response Splitting: Multiple HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities exist, some of which require admin access, while others, like in adclick.php, do not.

Impact of exploitation:
  - Full Path Disclosure: Attackers can learn the installation path of phpAdsNew, identify modified files, and potentially gain further insight into the system's configuration.
  - SQL Injection: Attackers can compromise the integrity of the database. If the database user has sufficient permissions, this could lead to local filesystem access and potentially full system compromise.
  - HTTP Response Splitting: Attackers can gain admin access to the application or perform other malicious actions via manipulating HTTP headers.

Attack vectors:
  - Full Path Disclosure: Attackers can access vulnerable files through a web browser.
  - SQL Injection: Attackers can manipulate the sessionID cookie.
  - HTTP Response Splitting: Attackers can manipulate HTTP requests.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Full Path Disclosure: No specific privileges are required; remote access to the vulnerable files is sufficient.
  - SQL Injection: Remote access is required, and magic_quotes_gpc must be off.
  - HTTP Response Splitting: Some instances require admin access while others do not; remote access to the application is required.
