```
  - Root cause of vulnerability:
    - The real-time scan driver does not validate the source of DeviceIoControl commands.
    - A boundary error in the ACE archive decompression library.
    - A directory traversal error in the archive decompression library.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    -  Unvalidated DeviceIoControl commands.
    - Stack-based buffer overflow.
    - Directory traversal vulnerability.
  - Impact of exploitation:
    - Privilege escalation to SYSTEM privileges.
    - Disabling of the real-time scan engine.
    - Arbitrary code execution.
    - Writing files to arbitrary directories.
  - Attack vectors:
    - Crafted DeviceIoControl requests.
    - Malicious ACE archive with an overly long filename.
    - Malicious archive with directory traversal sequences in filenames.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Local user access.
    - Ability to send DeviceIoControl requests.
    - Ability to provide malicious archive files.
