{
  "CVE-2005-3625": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the xpdf library, specifically when processing PDF files. These overflows occur because user-supplied integers related to buffer sizes in several stream decoding routines (FlateDecode, CCITTFaxDecode, DCTDecode) are not correctly validated for overflow or underflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflows",
      "Integer overflows",
	  "Insufficient validation of user-supplied input"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious PDF files, leading to a denial of service (crashing the application) or potentially achieving arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves enticing a user to open a specially crafted malicious PDF file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file and convince the victim to open it using a vulnerable application. No special position in the network is required."
