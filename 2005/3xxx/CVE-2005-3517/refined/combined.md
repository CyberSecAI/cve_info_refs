Products: Chipmunk >> ( Forum , Topsites , Directory )
, [ Guestbook ]
Versions: Tested: Last released of products
Vendor: http://chipmunk-scripts.com
Bug: ( XSS ) , [ Path Disclosure ]
Exploitation: Remote
---------------------------
Introduction:

featured forum system.
Chipmunk Topsites is a flexible topsite system
utilizing PHP4/mysql.
Chipmunk Directory is a powerful link indexing script.

---------------------------
vulnerability:XSS ( Forum , Topsites , Directory )
XSS Vulnerability in multiple PHP pages that may allow
a remote user to launch cross-site scripting attacks.
A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that,
when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary
scripting code to be executed by the target user's
browser. The code will originate from the site running
the software and will run in the security context of
that site. As a result, the code will be able to
access the target user's cookies (including
authentication cookies), if any, associated with the
site, access data recently submitted by the target
user via web form to the site, or take actions on the
site acting as the target user.
vulnerability:Path Disclosure [ Guestbook ]
A remote user can supply a specially crafted URL to
cause the system to display an error message that
discloses the installation path and other data.
