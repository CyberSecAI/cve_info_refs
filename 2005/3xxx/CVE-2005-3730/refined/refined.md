Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Revize(r) CMS

**Root Cause:** The blog post indicates that the Revize(r) CMS is vulnerable to both SQL injection and XSS attacks. While not explicitly stated, this suggests that the CMS fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries or scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The CMS does not properly sanitize user-supplied data before using it in SQL queries. This allows attackers to manipulate database queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The CMS does not properly sanitize user-supplied data before displaying it on web pages. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information, modify or delete data, or even gain control of the database server.
*   **XSS:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts that could steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the website, or perform other actions within the context of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** By injecting malicious SQL code in input fields of the CMS (forms, parameters, etc).
*  **XSS:** Injecting malicious scripts via forms, comments, user profile fields or any place where user input is reflected on a page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need to be able to submit input to the vulnerable CMS. This could be from a remote location.
* For XSS the attacker can be an anonymous user able to input content (comments) or an authenticated user.
