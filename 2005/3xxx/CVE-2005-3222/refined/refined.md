The provided content describes a method to bypass antivirus detection using specially crafted archive files. While it doesn't match the typical CVE description format, it does reveal a vulnerability related to antivirus software's inability to properly scan the contents of certain archive files before they are extracted.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Antivirus software fails to properly analyze specially crafted archive files (RAR, CAB) containing malicious payloads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Antivirus software's inability to unpack and scan the contents of specifically crafted archive files.
*   Certain archive formats, like RAR, can be exploited to bypass antivirus detection.
*   Some archive handlers like Winrar and Powerzip will open and extract the crafted files, while other handlers like Winzip and BitZipper will block them.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Malicious payloads, such as viruses, can bypass antivirus software detection and be delivered to a target system through archive files.
*   Malware can be successfully delivered to the user if they extract the archive file.
*   An attacker can use this bypass to deliver malware by bypassing the initial scan of the archive file.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Malicious RAR or CAB archives are crafted to evade antivirus detection.
*   The attacker delivers the archive file via email, file download, or other means.
*   The victim extracts the archive, thereby exposing their system to the malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create specially crafted archive files.
*   The attacker must deliver the malicious archive file to the victim, often relying on social engineering or other techniques.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be on the target system to exploit this, they only need to deliver a crafted archive.
