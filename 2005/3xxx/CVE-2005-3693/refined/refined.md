The provided content relates to CVE-2005-3693.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A design flaw exists in the SunnComm ActiveX control (AxWebRemoveCtrl) that is used by their uninstaller for the MediaMax DRM software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The ActiveX control allows any website to cause it to download and execute arbitrary code from a URL of the attacker's choosing. This allows for remote code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By visiting a malicious website, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability to download, install, and run arbitrary software on a user's computer without their knowledge. This could lead to severe damage, including adding the PC to a botnet or erasing the hard disk.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious website that exploits the flawed ActiveX control.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to host a malicious website and lure a victim who has used the vulnerable SunnComm uninstaller to visit the site. The victim's machine must have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is not present in the original software installed from CDs, but only in the separately distributed uninstaller.
- A tool was created to disable the vulnerable control and block it from being installed.
- SunnComm was working on a new version of the uninstaller at the time of the article.
