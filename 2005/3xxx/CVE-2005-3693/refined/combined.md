How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Not Again! Uninstaller for Other Sony DRM Also Opens Huge Security Hole

November 17, 2005 by [J. Alex Halderman](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/author/jhalderm/)

I have good news and bad news about Sony’s other CD DRM technology, the SunnComm MediaMax system. (For those keeping score at home, Ed and I have written a lot recently about Sony’s XCP copy protection technology, but this post is about a separate system that Sony ships on other CDs.)

I [wrote](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=925) last weekend about SunnComm’s spyware-like behavior. Sony CDs protected with their technology automatically install several megabytes of files without any meaningful notice or consent, silently phone home every time you play a protected album, and fail to include any uninstall option.

Here’s the good news: As several readers have pointed out, SunnComm will provide a tool to uninstall their software if users pester them enough. Typically this requires at least two rounds of emails with the company’s support staff.

Now the bad news: It turns out that the web-based uninstaller SunnComm provides opens up a major security hole very similar to the one created by the web-based uninstaller for Sony’s other DRM, XCP, that we [announced](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=927) a few days ago. I have verified that it is possible for a malicious web site to use the SunnComm hole to take control of PCs where the uninstaller has been used. In fact, the the SunnComm problem is easier to exploit than the XCP uninstaller flaw.

To be clear, the SunnComm security flaw does not apply to the software that ships on CDs, but only to the uninstaller that SunnComm distributes separately for removing the CD software. So if you haven’t used the uninstaller, you’re not vulnerable to this flaw and you don’t need to do anything.

If you visit the SunnComm uninstaller web page, you are prompted to accept a small software component—an ActiveX control called AxWebRemoveCtrl created by SunnComm. This control has a design flaw that allows any web site to cause it to download and execute code from an arbitrary URL. If you’ve used the SunnComm uninstaller, the vulnerable AxWebRemoveCtrl component is still on your computer, and if you later visit an evil web site, the site can use the flawed control to silently download, install, and run any software code it likes on your computer. The evil site could use this ability to cause severe damage, such as adding your PC to a botnet or erasing your hard disk.

You can tell whether the vulnerable control is installed on your computer by using our [AxWebRemoveCtrl detector](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jhalderm/blog/mm/detect.html).

We have created a tool that will disable the control and/or block it from being installed. To apply our tool, download [this file](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jhalderm/blog/mm/mm-blocker.reg) to a temporary location, then double click on the file’s icon in Windows. (Windows may ask you to confirm that you wish to add the information in the file to the system registry–choose “Yes.”) After the tool has been applied, you may delete the file you downloaded. The tool will take effect as soon as you close and restart Internet Explorer. We recommend that anyone who has used the SunnComm uninstaller run our tool as soon as possible.

Unfortunately, if you use our tool to block the control, you won’t be able to use SunnComm’s current uninstaller to remove their software. It’s up to them to replace the flawed uninstaller with a safe one as soon as possible, and to contact those who have already used the vulnerable uninstaller with instructions for closing the hole.

UPDATE (Nov. 18): We are currently helping SunnComm test a new version of the uninstaller.

   and now we know just why it is that musicians are beginning to make the switch fom being handled by record companies… to working direct with retailers.. as garth brooks did with his new box set…

   if record companies such as sonybmg are allowed to install malicious software that clearly is a breach of the privacy act… they deserve every penny of profit loss that they are about to experience as this idea takes hold…

   and given the internet was invented by the united states.. there need to be enforcable controls in place to prevent this sort of thing..

   i wholeheartedly agree that companies that engage in placing spyware on user’s computers without their consent should be shut down and their assets used to enforce this staple of society which we have all grown accustomed to using in our day to day lives..

   make it safe.. so that it can continue to be a source of learning, and business connectivity, advertising and marketing for everyone to enjoy.

   just my thoughts,

    I got the Sunncomm software after I put my CD in and said NO to the EULA – I complained to both Sony and Sunncomm and finally got them to send me a link to the uninstaller (which is the same link u can find here <http://www.sunncomm.com/support/sonybmg/> ) – they said on the reply email that this is a “BRAND NEW UNINSTALL UTILITY” found here-

    <http://www.sunncomm.com/support/tools/removal.asp>

    but I am not sure how new it is and if it is safe to use. Does anyone know if they have closed the security hole of this uninstaller and replaced the flawed uninstaller with a safe one???

    I will write back to Sunncomm to ask but no sure how they defined “safe”. Any info would help please!!!

    Hmmm, why is it my PC \_never\_ (really, not even once) was hit by evil programs, rootkits, virus, spyware(s/z), worms ?

    Could it be because I run a \*BSD/Linux system – that cannot be penetrated by sh\*t\_ware(s/z) made for “the most popular”

    ehhh, “system” in the world ?? ( There’s no way securing a “more sheeple” [burp] “system” anyway…).

    Actually I wrote most of the security\_programs protecting the machine myself, so anybody who wants to try crack it: be my guest (and get cracked yourself like the rest… 😉 ).

    At least I’ll portscan you – most xp (= eXterminated Privacy) (l)users will probably not even notice that, because they don’t even know what an IDS || a stateful-packetfilter is…

    My little advise to all you guys && girls: get rid of the m$ sh\*t && install a \_real\_ system like \*BSD || Linux, /etc…

    (You can download these systems for \_free\_ see: <http://www.freebsd.org/where.html> for \*BSD && <http://www.linuxiso.org/> for Linux ).

    So YOU’ll be controlling your PC – not some evil corporated criminals… (That’s what they are, it’ll take some time untill everybody realizes !).

    Btw. I quitted buying cds && dvds years ago, they are \_way\_ to expensive…

    (There are some little (Hackers-)jokes hidden in this reply, see if you can find them… 😉 )

    Yes, cglrcng I am very mad at Sony, I have already contacted a class action law firm — I’m in California.

    On my PC, I played a music CD I had just bought at Wal Mart. A a few days later my PC starts crashing, freezing or displaying hundreds of error mesagess — as time went by, it got worse and worse.

    Then I came home and found my DSL PC uploading all my personal info through my locked Zone Alarm firewall–I unplugged it.

    I used another PC to go online and I found out about Sony’s rootkit and what it did to me — I am mad, very mad.

    Anyone else wish to join me in a class action suit?

    I’m dead serious. I installed the phony rootkit removal tool labeled “Offline Software Updater” from First4InternetLtd “Update031105” on 11-4-05 but reached it by going to the Sony/BMG site which sent me to the First4Internet site and downloaded and ran the Offline Updater File. I saw it install – not un-install…That Black Box flash is un-mistakable. I immediately reported that to the

    Sony screwed up w/ me here bigtime…I build Custom Computers, update, repair, etc. and used almost strictly all Sony Drive products (Floppy, CD, CD-RW, DVD, CD/RW/DVD, Media Card Readers, etc.). I won’t again. That is a big loss as I have more than a few customers.

    I did run the Symantec Removal Tool later as the Active X item is not installed as shown by the check listed here earlier. I will assume it is removed by that removal tool. Since I use many anti-spyware tools I can’t really be sure which one closed the huge security hole(s) Sony and thier Cronies opened up on MY BOX!

    I will be trading in ALL MY SONY/BMG or BMG CD’s as they cannot & will NOT BE TRUSTED to use on my work machine. I have been a BMG Music Customer for years & years. I can’t trust any of them now. I cannot afford to infect my customers machines! Sony/BMG…You screwed up in my opinion and you have lost me as a customer…And ALL MY CUSTOMERS.

    Let’s be fair about this, if you are going to talk/bash XCP and/or Mediamax, why don’t you discuss Macrovision & their DRM?

    The irony is fantastic:

    Aren’t \*we\* supposed to be the ones who cannot be trusted?

    Aren’t \*we\* the underhanded thieves using technology to infiltrate their revenue model?

    Wasn’t it the obtaining of music without paying for it that started all this mess?

    Apparently, I am such an untrustworthy scheming thieving hacker-type that I deserve to have my machine rooted from a CD that I actually paid for. So much for customer, I am also apparently the enemy. Amazing!

    On a tangential note, the day before I heard about all this, I proved their view incorrect: I downloaded a song from a band that gets no radio play, and I liked it. So i downloaded more from the same album. I liked them all alot. Two days later, I went to the record store and I bought the album. The Internet generated a sale, from nothing, from no radio play at all.

    Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Sony.

    …and that goes for the rest of the record companies who think the same, who just made me think twice about ever paying for a song again, ever.

    Sony deserve disaster – pity the wrong people will then lose jobs as ever. They used to make great audio gear (I used it as a broadcasting pro and as a home user), then about 10 years back the rot set in and you got poor assembly quality, no real service, just insulting messages about consulting authorised repair dealers etc. Sony must smart up or go under.

    I am unable to understand sony’s logic. It goes something like this:

    1. Assume all customers are filthy pirates.

    2. So punish those sincere enuf to buy their CDs instead of going to torrents.

    3. After enduring infections and computer crashes expect the same customers (and others) to buy more of similar trojan infected spyware CDs.

    4. If they dont buy blame P2P networks.

    5. Put more malware into the CDs in the name of copyright protection ( i.e. point 2).

    And go round and round in the vicious cycle…

    While the glaring security holes in activex components have been obvious for a long long time now, it seems that a whole new class of vulnerability has been identified here. Active X components that do their jobs, require system access to do those jobs, and are intended to be one-shot applications instead are forced by the active X architecture to linger on indefinitely. While this isn’t a new attack, it certainly seems like there are plenty of people getting bit by it.

    It seems like anyone who publishes what they think is a one-shot activeX component like this should be reviewing it in detail. Some obvious classes that probably need investigation probably include:

    – Online updaters, as distributed by gaming companies (blizzard, maxis)

    – anti-virus scanners from security companies (the in-browser kind)

    – tax / financial software updaters

    Is there a google query that can identify the GUID’s used to identify these components, and a simple test to track down which ones are “safe for scripting?” – it may be a good technique for getting them out of circulation quickly.

    Remember the good old days when Sony first started this madness? A bunch of kids discovered their efforts could be thwarted with a black marker pen. That’s when we should have begun the boycott. I can picture a guy who looks a lot like Dr. Bunsen Honeydew slaving away at Sony’s labs preparing to hit their evil customers with Phase IV in this ongoing war against The Dark Side. Did they ever think that their sales might not be dropping so much because of pirates? It may just be because so much of their catalog is rubbish.
