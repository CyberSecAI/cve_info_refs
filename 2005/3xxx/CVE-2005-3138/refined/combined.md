Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers two security bugs that have recently been
discovered and fixed in the Bugzilla code:

+ config.cgi exposes information to users who aren't logged in, even
  when "requirelogin" is turned on in Bugzilla.

+ It is possible to bypass the "user visibility groups" restrictions
  if user-matching is turned on in "substring" mode.

All Bugzilla installations are advised to upgrade to the latest stable
version of Bugzilla, 2.20.

Development snapshots of 2.21 before 2.21.1 are also vulnerable. If you are
using a development snapshot, you should upgrade to 2.21.1, use CVS to update,
or apply the patches from the specific bugs listed below.

None of these vulnerabilities affect the old Bugzilla 2.16 branch.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
-------
Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.18rc1 - 2.18.3, 2.19 - 2.20rc2, 2.21
Description: config.cgi gives JavaScript and RDF information about Bugzilla
             to third-party clients, including a list of products in the
             Bugzilla installation. The "requirelogin" parameter requires
             that all people be logged into Bugzilla before seeing any data,
             as a security measure.
             In affected versions, config.cgi is always accessible, and
             always contains information to non-logged-in users, even when
             "requirelogin" is turned on, possibly exposing product names
             that administrators expected to be confidential.
Reference:   <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=308256>

Issue 2
-------
Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.19.1 - 2.20rc2, 2.21
Description: Bugzilla contains features to prevent users from "seeing" other
             users, enabled by the "usevisibilitygroups" parameter. Bugzilla
             also contains a feature called "user matching," which enables
             users to type in part of a username and get back a list of
             possible matches.
             If user matching is turned on and is in "substring" mode,
             all matching users will be returned to a query, regardless
             of the visibility groups settings, exposing users who should
             be invisible.
Reference:   <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=308662>

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fixes for all of the security bugs mentioned in this advisory
are included in the 2.18.4, 2.20, and 2.21.1 releases.  Upgrading
to these releases will protect installations from possible exploits
of these issues.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and CVS upgrade instructions are available at:
  <http://www.bugzilla.org/download/>

Specific patches for each of the individual issues can be found on the
corresponding bug reports for each issue, at the URL given in the
reference for that issue in the list above.

Monday, Feb 20th, 2006
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* The 'whinedays' and 'mostfreqthreshold' parameters are not correctly
  validated in editparams.cgi. The first one can lead to SQL injection.

* Escaped HTML markup in titles of RSS feeds are incorrectly decoded by
  some RSS readers and could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

* The login form on the home page, in conjuction with very specific
  configuration settings and a specially formed URL, may redirect you
  outside the Bugzilla installation, allowing the login name and password
  to be stolen.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       SQL injection
Affected:    2.17.1 and above
Description: The 'whinedays' parameter, editable from editparams.cgi,
             is not validated before being saved. This can lead to SQL
             injection in the whineatnews.pl script. This injection
             requires administrative privileges.
             The validation for the 'mostfreqthreshold' parameter is also
             missing, but this is not exploitable.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=312498

Class:       Cross Site Scripting
Affected:    2.20rc1 - 2.20, 2.21.1
Description: Some RSS readers incorrectly decode escaped HTML markup in
             feed titles and this could be used to inject some scripts.
             Although this is not a Bugzilla bug, we prefer to shift to
             Atom feeds, where the RFC is unambiguous about HTML markup
             in feed titles.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=313441

Class:       Sensitive Data Exposure
Affected:    2.19.3 and above
Description: When the Bugzilla login page is at a subdirectory of the web
             server and the subdirectory name is a resolvable host on the
             victim's local network, it is possible to craft a URL that,
             when used to login to Bugzilla, would send the user's
             credentials to this host.
             These conditions make this flaw very difficult to exploit.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=325079

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for these issues is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of these issues.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerability, there are patches available for the issues at the
"References" URL.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and git upgrade instructions are available at:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
