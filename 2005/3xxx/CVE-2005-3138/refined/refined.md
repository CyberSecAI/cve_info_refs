Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2005-3138:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `config.cgi` script in Bugzilla exposes sensitive information (JavaScript and RDF information, including a list of products) to unauthenticated users, even when the "requirelogin" setting is enabled.
*   **Weakness:** Improper access control; the `config.cgi` script bypasses the login requirement.
*   **Impact:** Information Leakage. Attackers can discover product names and potentially other confidential data by accessing `config.cgi` without logging in.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct HTTP request to the `config.cgi` script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication required; the attacker only needs network access to the Bugzilla instance.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** The "user matching" feature in "substring" mode bypasses visibility group restrictions.
*   **Weakness:** Inadequate enforcement of user visibility groups when user matching is in "substring" mode.
*   **Impact:** Information Leakage.  Users who should be hidden due to visibility group settings are exposed in search results.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a search query using the "user matching" feature in "substring" mode.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Requires access to the Bugzilla user interface with the ability to perform a user search.

**Affected Versions:**

*   **Issue 1:** 2.18rc1 - 2.18.3, 2.19 - 2.20rc2, 2.21
*   **Issue 2:** 2.19.1 - 2.20rc2, 2.21

**Resolution:**
Upgrade to Bugzilla versions 2.18.4, 2.20, or 2.21.1, which contain fixes for these issues. Patches for individual issues are also available.
