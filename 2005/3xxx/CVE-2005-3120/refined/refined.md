Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Lynx when handling connections to NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol) servers. Specifically, the issue arises during the processing of Asian characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is a buffer overflow. When Lynx connects to a malicious NNTP server, the server can send specially crafted data, including Asian characters, that causes Lynx to write past the boundary of an allocated buffer. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The buffer overflow can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running Lynx. This means an attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely. The attacker doesn't need direct access to the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious NNTP Server:** An attacker sets up a malicious NNTP server designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** A user must interact with the malicious NNTP server using the Lynx browser to trigger the exploit.
- **Redirection:** This can be achieved by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link to a NNTP URL on a website or through a redirect from a compromised website to the attacker's malicious NNTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **NNTP Server:** The attacker needs to operate a malicious NNTP server.
- **Network Connection:** The attacker needs to be able to make the malicious server accessible to the target.
- **Social Engineering (or Compromised Web Site):** To lure a user to connect to the malicious server, an attacker would typically need to employ social engineering tactics (e.g., tricking the user to visit a malicious webpage containing an NNTP URL) or compromise a website to inject malicious NNTP links or redirects.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Lynx and various distributions, including Debian, Slackware, and Red Hat.
- Fixes were provided in updated packages for various Linux distributions.
- The vulnerability is triggered specifically when handling Asian characters during an NNTP connection.
