Debian Security Advisory DSA 874-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
October 27th, 2005                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : lynx
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-3120

Ulf Härnhammar discovered a buffer overflow in lynx, a text-mode
browser for the WWW that can be remotely exploited.  During the
handling of Asian characters when connecting to an NNTP server lynx
can be tricked to write past the boundary of a buffer which can lead
to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.4.1b-3.3.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.5-2sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your lynx package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=170253#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2005-10-10 09:20:45 UTC  ``` Ulf Harnhammar found a flaw in Lynx that can be triggered when Lynx connects to a NNTP server.  A malicious news server could cause a buffer overflow, leading to the potential of arbitrary code execution as the user running lynx.  This issue requires a victim connects to the malicious news server, however this could be forced by a redirect from any malicious web page.  Embargo set for 20051017   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=170253#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2005-10-10 09:20:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 119760](attachment.cgi?id=119760 "Proposed patch from Thomas Dickey for lynx 2.8.6dev.14") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=119760&action=edit "Proposed patch from Thomas Dickey for lynx 2.8.6dev.14") Proposed patch from Thomas Dickey for lynx 2.8.6dev.14   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=170253#c6)  Mark J. Cox    2005-10-17 07:28:07 UTC  ``` Public today, removing embargo: <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2005-October/038019.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=170253#c7)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2005-10-17 07:44:27 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

lynx security update (RHSA-2005-803)

Original Release Date: January 16, 2006

Last Revised: February 17, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-010

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Lynx is a text-based Web browser.

Ulf Harnhammar discovered a stack overflow bug in Lynx when handling
connections to NNTP (news) servers. An attacker could create a web page
redirecting to a malicious news server which could execute arbitrary code
as the user running lynx. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
assigned the name
[CAN-2005-3120](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-3120) to this issue.

More information about this vulnerability can be found in the original
advisory released by Red Hat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-803.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with lynx installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | All | Low | See recommended actions below. An update is being considered for a future release. |
| Avaya Sip Enablement Services (SES) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. An update is being considered for a future release. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of lynx, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can be
installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected
by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. Red Hat) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support [website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : lynx-ssl
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2004-1617 CAN-2005-3120
BugTraq ID     : 11443
Debian Bug     : 296340

Several vulnerabilities have been discoverd in lynx, the popular
text-mode WWW browser.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
Project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2004-1617

    Michal Zalewski discovered that lynx is not able to grok invalid
    HTML including a TEXTAREA tag with a large COLS value and a large
    tag name in an element that is not terminated, and loops forever
    trying to render the broken HTML.

CAN-2005-3120

    Ulf Härnhammar discovered a buffer overflow that can be remotely
    exploited. During the handling of Asian characters when connecting
    to an NNTP server lynx can be tricked to write past the boundary
    of a buffer which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.5-2.5woody1.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.6-9sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your lynx-cur package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Lynx: Buffer overflow in NNTP processing — GLSA **200510-15**

Lynx contains a buffer overflow that may be exploited to execute arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/lynx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.8.5-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.8.5-r1** |

### Background

Lynx is a text-mode browser for the World Wide Web. It supports
multiple URL types, including HTTP and NNTP URLs.

### Description

When accessing a NNTP URL, Lynx connects to a NNTP server and
retrieves information about the available articles in the target
newsgroup. Ulf Harnhammar discovered a buffer overflow in a function
that handles the escaping of special characters.

### Impact

An attacker could setup a malicious NNTP server and entice a user
to access it using Lynx (either by creating NNTP links on a web page or
by forcing a redirect for Lynx users). The data returned by the NNTP
server would trigger the buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code
with the rights of the user running Lynx.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Lynx users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/lynx-2.8.5-r1"
```
