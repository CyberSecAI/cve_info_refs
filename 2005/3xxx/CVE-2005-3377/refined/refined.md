Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in how certain anti-virus scanning engines determine the file type. They rely on the "magic byte" (e.g., "MZ" for EXE files) at the beginning of a file to identify its type. If a file with a different extension (like .BAT, .HTML, or .EML) has the magic byte of an EXE file prepended to it, many anti-virus programs fail to correctly identify and scan the file's actual content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect File Type Detection:** Anti-virus engines are vulnerable to evasion by relying solely on the initial magic bytes for file type identification.
*   **Lack of Content Inspection:** The vulnerability is a result of not deeply inspecting the content after detecting the "MZ" header, and assuming it is an executable.
*   **Magic Byte Forgery:** The ability to prepend arbitrary magic bytes to bypass anti-virus checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Anti-Virus Evasion:** Attackers can craft malicious files with manipulated headers that bypass anti-virus detection.
*   **Malware Delivery:** This can be used to deliver undetected malware via seemingly innocuous file types (.BAT, .HTML, .EML).
*   **Compromised Systems:** Undetected malware can lead to compromised systems, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Manipulation:** An attacker modifies a malicious file by prepending an "MZ" magic byte (or other applicable header) to the beginning of the file.
*   **Distribution:** Distributing the modified file through usual channels.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malware Development:** The attacker needs to have a malicious payload to deliver.
*   **File Manipulation Tools:** Ability to add specific bytes at the beginning of a file.
*   **Distribution Mechanism:** Ability to deliver the manipulated file to the target user through standard means such as email, web links, etc.
*   **No Special Privileges:** This attack doesn't require special access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content includes a list of vulnerable and non-vulnerable antivirus products.
*   The content references an article ("The Magic of magic byte") with more details and examples.
*   The vulnerability is considered critical because it allows bypassing malware detection, potentially leading to widespread infections.
*   The vulnerability is not specific to the "MZ" header and can be applied with other headers.
