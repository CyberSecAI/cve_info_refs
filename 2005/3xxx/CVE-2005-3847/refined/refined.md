```
Root cause of vulnerability: A threaded real-time process that is dumping core can be forced into a deadlock state. This is triggered by sending a SIGKILL signal to the process while it is in the process of dumping core.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Deadlock.

Impact of exploitation: Denial of service.

Attack vectors: Sending a SIGKILL signal to a threaded real-time process while it is dumping core.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have the ability to send signals to the target process.
