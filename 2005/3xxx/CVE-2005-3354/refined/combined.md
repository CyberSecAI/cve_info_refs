How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Sylpheed, Sylpheed-Claws: Buffer overflow in LDIF importer — GLSA **200511-13**

Sylpheed and Sylpheed-Claws contain a buffer overflow vulnerability which
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/sylpheed** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.4** |

| Package | **mail-client/sylpheed-claws** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.5-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.5-r1** |

### Background

Sylpheed is a lightweight email client and newsreader.
Sylpheed-Claws is a 'bleeding edge' version of Sylpheed. They both
support the import of address books in LDIF (Lightweight Directory
Interchange Format).

### Description

Colin Leroy reported buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Sylpheed
and Sylpheed-Claws. The LDIF importer uses a fixed length buffer to
store data of variable length. Two similar problems exist also in the
Mutt and Pine addressbook importers of Sylpheed-Claws.

### Impact

By convincing a user to import a specially-crafted LDIF file into
the address book, a remote attacker could cause the program to crash,
potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the software.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sylpheed users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/sylpheed-2.0.4"
```

All Sylpheed-Claws users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/sylpheed-claws-1.0.5-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 906-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
November 22nd, 2005                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : sylpheed
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-3354
Debian Bug     : 338436

Colin Leroy discovered several buffer overflows in a number of
importer routines in sylpheed, a light-weight e-mail client with GTK+,
that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

The following matrix explains which versions fix this vulnerability

                     old stable (woody)   stable (sarge)  unstable (sid)
sylpheed               0.7.4-4woody1      1.0.4-1sarge1      2.0.4-1
sylpheed-gtk1              n/a                 n/a           1.0.6-1
sylpheed-claws       0.7.4claws-3woody1   1.0.4-1sarge1      1.0.5-2
sylpheed-claws-gtk2        n/a                 n/a          1.9.100-1

We recommend that you upgrade your sylpheed package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
