# phpMyAdmin: Local file inclusion and XSS vulnerabilities — GLSA **200510-21**

phpMyAdmin contains a local file inclusion vulnerability that may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code, along with several cross-site scripting
issues.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/phpmyadmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6.4\_p3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6.4\_p3** |

### Background

phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
administration of MySQL over the web.

### Description

Stefan Esser discovered that by calling certain PHP files directly, it
was possible to workaround the grab\_globals.lib.php security model and
overwrite the $cfg configuration array. Systems running PHP in safe
mode are not affected. Futhermore, Tobias Klein reported several
cross-site-scripting issues resulting from insufficient user input
sanitizing.

### Impact

A local attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious
requests, causing the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of
the user running the web server. Furthermore, the cross-site scripting
issues give a remote attacker the ability to inject and execute
malicious script code or to steal cookie-based authentication
credentials, potentially compromising the victim's browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround for all those issues at this time.

### Resolution

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.4_p3"
```

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2005-5

**Date:** 2005-10-22

**Updated:** 2005-10-25

### Summary

(1) Local file inclusion vulnerability and (2) Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability

### Description

We received a security advisory from Stefan Esser (sesser@hardened-php.net) about (1). We received a security advisory from Tobias Klein (tk@trapkit.de) about (2). We wish to thank both of them for their work.

(1) : Due to the sequence of execution in the code that gets form parameters in some scripts, it was possible to craft a special attack form that overwrites configuration parameters.

(2) : Some scripts were vulnerable to XSS attacks: left.php, queryframe.php and server\_databases.php.

### Severity

We consider these vulnerabilities to be serious. However, (1) can be exploited only on systems not running in PHP safe mode (unless a deliberate hole was opened by including in open\_basedir some paths containing sensitive data).

### Affected Versions

We did not make an extensive verification on this. Probably all previous versions.

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.6.4-pl3 or newer.

## PMASA-2005-5

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2005-5

**Date:** 2005-10-22

**Updated:** 2005-10-25

### Summary

(1) Local file inclusion vulnerability and (2) Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability

### Description

We received a security advisory from Stefan Esser (sesser@hardened-php.net) about (1). We received a security advisory from Tobias Klein (tk@trapkit.de) about (2). We wish to thank both of them for their work.

(1) : Due to the sequence of execution in the code that gets form parameters in some scripts, it was possible to craft a special attack form that overwrites configuration parameters.

(2) : Some scripts were vulnerable to XSS attacks: left.php, queryframe.php and server\_databases.php.

### Severity

We consider these vulnerabilities to be serious. However, (1) can be exploited only on systems not running in PHP safe mode (unless a deliberate hole was opened by including in open\_basedir some paths containing sensitive data).

### Affected Versions

We did not make an extensive verification on this. Probably all previous versions.

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.6.4-pl3 or newer.

### References

For (1): <http://www.hardened-php.net/advisory_162005.73.html>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-2869 CVE-2005-3300 CVE-2005-3301
BugTraq ID     : 15169
Debian Bug     : 328501 335306 335513

Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
phpmyadmin, a set of PHP-scripts to administrate MySQL over the WWW.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CAN-2005-2869

    Andreas Kerber and Michal Cihar discovered several cross-site
    scripting vulnerabilities in the error page and in the cookie
    login.

CVE-2005-3300

    Stefan Esser discovered missing safety checks in grab_globals.php
    that could allow an attacker to induce phpmyadmin to include an
    arbitrary local file.

CVE-2005-3301

    Tobias Klein discovered several cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to inject arbitrary
    HTML or client-side scripting.

The version in the old stable distribution (woody) has probably its
own flaws and is not easily fixable without a full audit and patch
session.  The easier way is to upgrade it from woody to sarge.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2-3sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.4-pl1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.
