{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because a registered ActiveX control, MCINSCTL.DLL, does not restrict which domains can load the control for execution. Specifically, the McLog object within this control allows logging to a file through the StartLog and AddLog methods. The lack of domain restriction allows attackers to use this object to create or overwrite arbitrary files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient domain restriction on ActiveX control loading",
      "Insecure use of logging functionality"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to create or append to arbitrary files. An attacker can write to a startup folder to achieve arbitrary code execution during the next reboot or logon session.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote exploitation via a specially crafted web page that uses the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a targeted user to visit a malicious website containing the exploit. The attacker doesn't require authentication."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "McAfee VirusScan (mcinsctl.dll 4.0.0.83)"
  ],
  "cve": "CVE-2005-3657"
