The provided content describes a vulnerability related to anti-virus software detection evasion.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the scanning engine of multiple anti-virus products. These engines rely on "magic bytes" (file headers) to determine the file type for scanning. By prepending a different magic byte to a file, specifically the "MZ" (executable) magic byte to files like .bat, .html, or .eml, the anti-virus software incorrectly identifies the file type and fails to detect malicious code within.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper file type identification based on magic bytes.
- Failure to scan files with mismatched magic bytes.
- Inability to detect malicious code when file type is misidentified.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Evasion of anti-virus detection.
- Successful execution of malicious code.
- Compromise of system security.

**Attack vectors:**
- Modifying malicious files by prepending a different magic byte such as "MZ" (executable).
- Sending modified malicious files via email or other means.
- Tricking users into opening modified files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to modify file contents.
- Ability to deliver malicious files to targets.

The vulnerability is described with a list of affected vendors and software. The content mentions that some file types like .bat, .html and .eml files can be executed even with "junk" data at the beginning. This allows malicious code within these file types to be hidden when the file is prepended with an executable header like "MZ".
