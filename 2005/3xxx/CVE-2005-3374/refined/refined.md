The provided content describes a vulnerability related to antivirus software detection evasion.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the scanning engines of multiple antivirus programs. These engines incorrectly determine file types based on the file's "magic byte" (e.g., "MZ" for EXE files) at the beginning of the file. By prepending the magic byte of an EXE file to other file types, like .BAT, .HTML, and .EML, attackers can trick the antivirus software into misidentifying the file, leading to a bypass of security checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect file type identification based solely on magic bytes.
- Inability to detect malicious content when the file type is misrepresented.
- The described approach allows attackers to use a wide range of headers to evade detection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Antivirus software fails to detect malicious files.
- Attackers can deliver malware disguised as harmless file types.
- This technique can be used to bypass file filters and other security mechanisms.
- Potentially allowing widespread infection by existing or future viruses.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Modifying malicious files by prepending a different magic byte, specifically that of an executable file ("MZ").
- Distributing these manipulated files through standard delivery methods (e.g., email attachments, web downloads).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to modify the content of the malicious files.
- Ability to deliver the files through regular channels.
- Basic understanding of file formats and file signatures.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is not due to a change in detection signature but rather a bypass of the scanning engine logic.
- The researcher created a "triple headed" program with different execution entry points depending on the extension (exe, html, eml).
- Multiple AV vendors were vulnerable, but some were not. A full list of both vulnerable and non-vulnerable software is provided.
