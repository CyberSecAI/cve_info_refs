  "CVE-2005-3868": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The K-Search application is vulnerable to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization and validation.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'id' parameter in the 'index.php?req=edit' request.",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS via the 'term' parameter in the 'index.php?req=search' request."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:\n\n*   SQL Injection: Gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially allowing the attacker to modify or delete data, or to gain access to sensitive information like user credentials, or even potentially execute arbitrary code on the server if database user has those permissions.\n*   XSS: Inject malicious scripts into the web page, which could be used to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "SQL Injection: Sending a crafted HTTP request to `http://localhost//index.php?req=edit&id=<SQL injection payload>`.",
        "XSS: Sending a crafted HTTP request to `http://localhost/index.php?term=<XSS payload>&sm=Search&source=1&req=search`"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
