Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a CRLF injection issue. This means that an attacker can inject carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters into HTTP headers, which can then be interpreted by a web server as the end of one header and the start of another.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** Specifically, the vulnerability enables HTTP Response Splitting attacks. By injecting CRLF characters, an attacker can manipulate the HTTP response headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTTP Response Manipulation:** Attackers can insert arbitrary HTTP headers and body content into the response stream, leading to various attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cache poisoning, and session hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** This is a remote vulnerability, meaning an attacker can exploit it over a network.
*   **CRLF Injection:** The specific method of attack is injecting CRLF characters into a vulnerable parameter of a phpMyAdmin script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to identify a script and parameter within phpMyAdmin that is vulnerable to CRLF injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is only triggered when `register_globals` is set to `on` in the PHP configuration, which is a deprecated configuration setting.
*   The Debian Security Advisory also notes that this issue is fixed in phpMyAdmin version 2.6.2-3sarge2 for the stable distribution (sarge) and version 2.9.0.3-1 for the upcoming stable release (etch) and unstable distribution (sid).
*   The provided information confirms that phpMyAdmin was vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting due to CRLF injection, as described in the CVE.
