How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Summary
=======
The CiscoWorks VPN/Security Management Solution (VMS) is a network
management application that includes Web-based tools for configuring,
monitoring, and troubleshooting VPNs, firewalls, network intrusion
detection systems (NIDSs), network intrusion prevention systems (NIPSs)
and host intrusion prevention systems (HIPSs). CiscoWorks VMS also
includes network device inventory, change audit, and software
distribution features.
An issue exists in one of the components of the Cisco Management Center
for IPS Sensors (IPS MC) v2.1 during the generation of the Cisco IOS
IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) configuration file that may result in
some signatures belonging to certain classes being disabled during the
configuration deployment process.
Cisco has made a free software patch available to address this
vulnerability for affected customers.
This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20051101-ipsmc.shtml.
Affected Products
=================
Vulnerable Products
+------------------
\* Cisco IOS IPS devices that have been configured by IPS MC v2.1.
Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------
\* Cisco IOS IPS devices that have NOT been configured by IPS MC v2.1.
This category includes Cisco IOS IPS devices that have been
configured by using any of the following methods:
+ Cisco IDS MC (Management Center for IDS Sensors)
+ Cisco SDM (Security Device Manager)
+ Cisco IOS CLI (Command Line Interface)
\* Any other Cisco IDS/IPS solution, configured by either Cisco IPS MC
v2.1, Cisco IDS MC (any version), Cisco SDM (any version) or by
using the Cisco IOS CLI. These include:
+ Cisco IOS IDS
+ Cisco PIX/ASA IDS
+ Cisco IPS 4200 Series Sensors
+ Cisco Catalyst 6500/7600 Series Intrusion Detection System
(IDSM-2) Module
+ Cisco IDS Network Module (NM-CIDS-K9)
+ Cisco ASA Advanced Inspection and Prevention (AIP) Security
Services Module
No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.
Details
=======
Some Cisco routers running Cisco IOS include a feature called Cisco IOS
IPS. The Cisco IOS IPS acts as an in-line intrusion protection sensor,
watching packets and sessions as they flow through the router and
scanning each packet to match any of the Cisco IOS IPS signatures that
have been enabled on the device configuration. When it detects
suspicious activity, it responds before network security can be
compromised and logs the event through Cisco IOS syslog messages or
Security Device Event Exchange (SDEE). The network administrator can
configure Cisco IOS IPS to choose the appropriate response to various
threats.
Customers can use multiple methods, including Cisco IPS MC, Cisco IDS
MC, Cisco SDM and the Cisco IOS CLI, to enable, disable and configure
Cisco IOS IPS signatures. Some signatures dealing with TCP or UDP
traffic analyze traffic destined to specific ports. Those ports are
pre-configured with default values, and some signatures might allow
changes to the list of ports to be monitored.
If the Cisco IOS IPS devices have been configured by using the Cisco
IPS MC v2.1, the Cisco IPS MC might download a configuration file to
the device that does not contain a value for the port field in one or
more signatures, resulting in the affected Cisco IOS IPS device
disabling those signatures. Only signatures using either the STRING.TCP
or STRING.UDP signature micro-engine (SME) are affected by this
vulnerability. Additionally, this behavior only happens if those
signatures were enabled and configured from the Cisco IPS MC GUI ;
signatures belonging to the STRING.TCP or STRING.UDP SMEs that were
previously configured on the device and imported into the Cisco IPS MC
will not experience this issue.
The list of signatures currently loaded into a Cisco IOS IPS device and
their status can be obtained by executing the "show ip ips signatures"
command. The following abbreviated output shows signatures currently
loaded into the device, both enabled and disabled:
Router#show ip ips signatures
Builtin signatures are configured

Any signature with a capital N under the 'On' column is DISABLED, while
any signature with a capital Y under the same column is ENABLED. In
this example, signatures 4608:0 and 11000:0 (belonging to the
STRING.UDP SME), and signature 3117:0 (belonging to the STRING.TCP SME)
are listed as disabled. For each signature listed as disabled in the
output of the "show ip ips signatures" command, a corresponding
"ip ips signature <SigID> <SubsigID> disable" command should be visible
on the running configuration. This is an example of the
"show running-configuration" command, using a filter to only display
configuration lines belonging to signatures that have been disabled:
Router#show running-config | include ip ips signature .\* disable
ip ips signature 11000 0 disable
ip ips signature 4608 0 disable
ip ips signature 3117 0 disable
Router#
This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID
CSCsc33696.
Impact
======
While this is not a vulnerability in the Cisco IOS IPS code itself, in
the processing performed by Cisco IOS IPS on traffic traversing the
device, or in the Cisco IPS MC v2.1, this vulnerability might result in
an incomplete analysis of network traffic traversing the Cisco IOS IPS
device, which could allow some attacks to go unnoticed.
Software Versions and Fixes
===========================
When considering software upgrades, please also consult
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products\_security\_advisories\_listing
.html
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete
upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") for assistance.
Cisco has developed a software fix for this vulnerability. Once the fix
is applied to a VMS server running IPS MC v2.1, the IPS MC will
correctly populate the port field attached to a signature using either
the STRING.TCP or STRING.UDP SME. Additional steps will be required to
be performed. Please read the README file published together with the
software fix.
In order to obtain this software fix, customers should access the VMS
Software download page for IDS MC and IPS MC, available at
http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/mgmt-ctr-ids-app.
The fix consists of the following three files:
\* idsmdc2.1.0-win-CSCsc336961.tar - this file contains the fix itself
for IPS MC v2.1 running on the Windows operating system.
\* CSCOids2.1.0-sol-CSCsc336961.tar - this file contains the fix
itself for IPS MC v2.1 running on the Solaris operating system.
\* CSCsc33696-README.txt - this file contains instructions on how to
apply the software fix to an affected IPS MC v2.1 installation
(either Windows or Solaris) and any needed pre and post
installation tasks to be carried out by the user.
