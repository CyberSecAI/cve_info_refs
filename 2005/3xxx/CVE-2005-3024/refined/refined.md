Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in vBulletin <= 3.0.7:

*   **Vulnerabilities Present:**

    *   **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in various files within both the administrator control panel (`admincp`) and moderator control panel (`modcp`).
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:**  Users with access to the administrator panel and privileges to manage avatars, icons, or smileys can upload arbitrary files.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist in various files within both the administrator control panel (`admincp`) and moderator control panel (`modcp`). Additionally, several admin panel files don't properly filter HTML/JavaScript in posts, titles and announcements, leading to XSS.

*   **Root Cause:**

    *   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in SQL queries.
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Lack of proper file type validation during the upload process.
    *   **XSS:** Insufficient output encoding/escaping of user-supplied input when rendered in web pages.

*   **Attack Vectors:**

    *   **SQL Injection:** Crafted HTTP GET/POST requests to vulnerable scripts with malicious SQL code in parameters such as `calendarcustomfieldid`, `announcement`, `forumid`, `userid`, `usertitleid`, `dostyleid`, etc.
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Uploading a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script) via the avatar/icon/smilie upload functionality in the admin panel.
    *   **XSS:** Crafted HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts with malicious JavaScript code in parameters such as `loc`, `ip`, `email`, `orderby`, `hex`, `rgb`, `expandset`, etc.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**

    *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can read sensitive data (private messages, password hashes), elevate privileges, and potentially modify database content.
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can gain the ability to execute commands under the context of the web server. This could lead to complete system compromise.
    *   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

    *   **SQL Injection:** Some SQL injection vulnerabilities are accessible to moderators; others require administrator privileges.
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Requires administrator panel access and privileges to manage avatars/icons/smileys.
    *   **XSS:** Some XSS vulnerabilities are accessible to moderators; others require administrator privileges.

*   **Affected versions:**

    *   vBulletin <= 3.0.7

*   **Solution:**

    *   Upgrade to vBulletin 3.0.9
