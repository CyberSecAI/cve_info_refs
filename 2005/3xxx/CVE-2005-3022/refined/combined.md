| BuHa Security-Advisory #3 | Sep 17th, 2005 |
| feat. SePro Bugtraq | |
---------------------------------------------------
| Vendor | vBulletin |
| URL | http://vbulletin.com/ |
| Version | <= vBulletin 3.0.9 |
| Risk | Moderate (SQL-Injection and |
| | Arbitrary File Upload) |
---------------------------------------------------
First of all I want to express my disappointment with the behavior of
the vbulletin.com and vbulletin-germany.com team and the missing
cooperation. We sent them a mail with a list of security issues and they
immediately answered that they are going to look into these bugs. We
never got another mail with information about the problems they fixed -
they also did not inform us about the release of the latest version
which \*should\* address all known security problems. So it comes as no
surprise that they missed to fix a lot of moderate security bugs in the
latest version. They did not consider it necessary to release \*any\*
information about patched security problems in their announcement [1]
for the current version too. Some thanks/credits for our trouble/time
with the audit would have been a nice gesture but who cares.
o Description:

scripting language; PHP, and is complemented with a highly efficient
and ultra fast back-end database engine built using MySQL.
