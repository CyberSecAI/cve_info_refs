A. VULNERABILITY TITLE:
Zyxel P2000W v.1 VOIP WIFI Phone undocumented port UDP/9090

VULNERABILITY DETAILS, IMPACT AND WORKAROUND:
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Zyxel P2000W v.1 VOIP WIFI phone has an undocumented port, UDP/9090.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: An unauthenticated attacker can connect to UDP/9090 and retrieve information about the phone, specifically the phone's MAC address and software version.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can use this vulnerability to easily identify the phone and software version. Additionally, the undocumented open port may provide an avenue for DoS attacks.
- Attack vectors: Network access to UDP port 9090.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to connect to the phone via the network to UDP port 9090.

B. VULNERABILITY TITLE:
Zyxel P2000W v.1 VOIP WIFI Phone uses hardcoded DNS servers

VULNERABILITY DETAILS, IMPACT AND WORKAROUND:
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Zyxel P2000W v.1 VOIP WIFI phone uses hardcoded DNS servers located in Taiwan for the phone's DNS configuration.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Hardcoded DNS server IP addresses (Primary: 168.95.1.1, Secondary: 139.175.55.244).
- Impact of exploitation: The hardcoded DNS servers could cause unintentional DoS if the servers in Taiwan become unavailable. If the DNS servers are compromised, all Zyxel phone users worldwide are vulnerable to being redirected to malicious SIP servers.
- Attack vectors: If an attacker compromises the DNS servers, all phones using them would be affected.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to compromise the hardcoded DNS servers to perform redirection attacks.
