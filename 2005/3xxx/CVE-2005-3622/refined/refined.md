Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2005-3622:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of direct access checks in multiple PHP scripts within the phpMyAdmin libraries directory. Specifically, multiple scripts in the `libraries` directory do not properly restrict direct access. When these scripts are accessed directly, they expose the full server path due to the way they are written and how they handle file inclusions or errors. This results in sensitive path information being displayed. Additionally, there is an HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization in `libraries/header_http.inc.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):** Multiple scripts in the `/libraries` directory expose the full server path when accessed directly. This happens because the script's code reveals file paths.
*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** The `libraries/header_http.inc.php` script is vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting due to a lack of input sanitization. If register\_globals is enabled, an attacker can inject malicious headers via direct requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the full path of the server, which can be used in further attacks.
*   **User Compromise:** The HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability can potentially lead to user compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send direct HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP scripts in the `/libraries` directory, causing the scripts to reveal the server path.
*   **HTTP Response Manipulation:** By exploiting the HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability, an attacker can manipulate the HTTP response headers which might lead to malicious activity such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance.
*   **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Register Globals (For HTTP Response Splitting):** For the HTTP Response Splitting, `register_globals` must be enabled on the server.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory lists specific vulnerable files in the `libraries` directory.
*   The HTTP response splitting issue requires the vulnerable server to have `register_globals` enabled.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Low" risk for information disclosure and "Low/Medium" in severity when combined with HTTP Response splitting.
