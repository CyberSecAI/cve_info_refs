Severity: Low/Medium
Title: Multiple vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin
Date: 12.11.2005
ID: FS-05-02
Author: Toni Koivunen (toni.koivunen (at) fitsec.com)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Background:
phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
administration of MySQL over the Web. Currently it can create and drop
databases, create/drop/alter tables, delete/edit/add fields, execute any
SQL statement, manage keys on fields.
Affected versions:
Atleast 2.7.0-beta1, most likely others versions also.
Description:
Vuln 1:
Full Path Disclosures in the following files:
libraries/string.lib.php
libraries/storage\_engines.lib.php
libraries/sqlparser.lib.php
libraries/sql\_query\_form.lib.php
libraries/select\_theme.lib.php
libraries/select\_lang.lib.php
libraries/relation\_cleanup.lib.php
libraries/left\_header.inc.php
libraries/import.lib.php
libraries/header\_meta\_style.inc.php
libraries/grab\_globals.lib.php
libraries/get\_foreign.lib.php
(get\_foreign.lib.php?field=foo&foreigners[foo]=foo)
libraries/display\_tbl\_links.lib.php
(display\_tbl\_links.lib.php?doWriteModifyAt=left&edit\_url=foo)
libraries/display\_import.lib.php
libraries/display\_export.lib.php
libraries/display\_create\_table.lib.php
libraries/display\_create\_database.lib.php
libraries/db\_table\_exists.lib.php
libraries/database\_interface.lib.php
libraries/common.lib.php
libraries/check\_user\_privileges.lib.php
libraries/charset\_conversion.lib.php
(charset\_conversion.lib.php?cfg[AllowAnywhereRecoding]=true&allow\_recodi
ng=true)
libraries/sqlvalidator.lib.php
(libraries/sqlvalidator.lib.php?cfg[SQLValidator]=use=TRUE)
libraries/import/sql.php
libraries/fpdf/ufpdf.php
libraries/auth/cookie.auth.lib.php
(libraries/auth/cookie.auth.lib.php?coming\_from\_common=true)
Vuln 2:
Http Response Splitting in libraries/header\_http.inc.php
The script doesn't check for direct access. If register\_globals
is on, it is possible for a remote attacker to cause http
response splitting.
Impact:
A remote attacker could exploit this to learn installation paths on
server.
The HTTP Response splitting vulnerability can lead to user compromise
amongst other things.
Status:
12.11.2005 Vulnerabilities found
