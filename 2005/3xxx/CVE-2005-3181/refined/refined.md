    "description": "Robert Derr discovered that the audit subsystem uses an incorrect function to free memory, which allows a denial of service attack.",

    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability is in the system call auditing code. When the CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL option is enabled, this leads to memory exhaustion, and eventually a denial of service. A local attacker could also speed this up by excessively calling system calls."
