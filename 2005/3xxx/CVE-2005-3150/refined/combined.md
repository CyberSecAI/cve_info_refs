# Weex: Format string vulnerability â€” GLSA **200510-09**

Weex contains a format string error that may be exploited by malicious
servers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/weex** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6.1.5-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6.1.5-r1** |

### Background

Weex is a non-interactive FTP client typically used to update web
pages.

### Description

Ulf Harnhammar discovered a format string bug in Weex that can be
triggered when it is first run (or when its cache files are rebuilt,
using the -r option).

### Impact

An attacker could setup a malicious FTP server which, when
accessed using Weex, could trigger the format string bug and end up
executing arbitrary code with the rights of the user running Weex.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Weex users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/weex-2.6.1.5-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=86833#c0)  Emanuel Haupt    2005-10-02 15:50:13 UTC  ``` ftp/weex suffers from a remote format string security bug.  Someone who controls an FTP server that weex will log in to can set up malicious data in the account that weex will use, and that will cause a format string bug that will allow remote code execution. It will only happen when weex is first run or when its cache files are rebuilt with the -r option, though.  This behaviour is verified in versions 2.6.1 and 2.6.1.5  Fix: See: <http://critical.ch/weex.log> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=86833#c1)  Jean-Yves Lefort   freebsd_committer freebsd_triage  2005-10-02 16:45:22 UTC  ``` Responsible Changed From-To: freebsd-ports-bugs->jylefort  Take. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=86833#c2)  Jean-Yves Lefort   freebsd_committer freebsd_triage  2005-10-02 16:59:02 UTC  ``` State Changed From-To: open->closed  Committed, thanks! ``` |  |
