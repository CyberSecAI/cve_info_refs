How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Hardened PHP

PHP is far and away the most popular backend programming
language today, with more than 80 websites worldwide taking advantage of PHP
solutions.

All of the most popular CMS platforms – including WordPress,
Joomla!, and Drupal (just to name a few) leverage this technology. It’s
flexibility and versatility make it a powerhouse programming language, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean that it is as secure as it could or should be “right
out of the box”, so to speak.

It’s popularity, it’s widespread adaptation, and its
relatively easy to learn structure has made PHP a major target for cyber
criminals and hackers to exploit. This is why it’s mission-critical that you
harden your PHP files server-side as much as possible, protecting your server,
your content, and your visitors from these kinds of dangerous exploits.

PHP can be hardened manually as well as with patching
protocols. Below we highlight the steps you’ll want to take to make sure that
your PHP installation is as locked down as possible.

**Locate the PHP Config File You’re Hardening on Your Server**

The very first step in hardening your PHP installation is
first finding the PHP configuration file on your server to begin with.

Depending on the hosting that you are taking advantage of
(the actual provider as well as the type of hosting you have selected) it can
be in a variety of different locations. The best way to quickly locate this
critical file is to simply do a server-side search for “PHP.ini” as this is the
actual file that you’ll want to modify, edit, and harden moving forward.

**Editing the File on Shared Hosting**

Individuals looking to harden their PHP on a shared hosting platform (see [The Blog Starter](https://www.theblogstarter.com/) for hosting options) will have a bit of a tougher hill to climb, if only because most providers do not offer root access to the server with this level of hosting.

You’ll have to contact your hosting provider directly to see
if you can edit the main PHP.ini file itself. In the event that you aren’t
allowed this kind of access, you can still request to have access to the
“.HTaccess” file on your server to make the changes you need to.

You won’t be able to make changes quite as quickly this way
as you would have been able to with a patch (like we highlight below), but you
can manually make individual line edits to your PHP settings this way to enjoy
a higher level of security.

Shared hosting may still have limitations on the PHP elements you can edit no matter how much access you are granted. If you want total control over hardening your PHP (and total control over the security of your web platform), it’s not a bad idea to move to Dedicated or VPS servers if you can afford it.

**Editing the File on Dedicated/VPS servers**

If you are moving forward with a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or Dedicated server set up the process for hardening your PHP is a lot
easier, though it’s still not as quick as applying a server wide patch like we
highlight below.

In the backend administration toolset of your server
solution you’ll find a tool called the Web Host Manager. This is usually
located under the “Service Configuration” settings option in your backend
dashboard.

This tool is going to allow you to select the PHP
Configuration Editor, and editor that allows you to make changes to your
PHP.ini file through a more user-friendly interface than actually downloading
the file, opening it up in Notepad or a similar application, and then making
the edits individually with the actual source code itself.

There are a handful of individual settings that you’re going
to want to reconfigure manually when taking this approach to hardening your PHP
installation, including (but not limited to):

•           Remote
Connections

•           Run Time
Settings

•           Input Data
Restrictions

•           Error
Handling

•           Restrict
File Access

•           File
Uploads

•           Session
Security

•           Soap Cache

… And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

**Use a Patch like Suhosin to Harden PHP Almost Instantly**

The big attraction behind PHP is that it is so easy to learn,
so easy to develop with, and about as flexible as a programming language gets –
and that’s why a lot of people feel comfortable hardening their PHP manually,
running line by line through their PHP.ini file and doing the heavy lifting of
securing their system on their own.

And while you may be a top-tier programmer and feel
completely confident in your coding prowess, the truth of the matter is that if
you allow ANY coding from ANY outside developers to run on your server you’ll
still have vulnerabilities that you may not be able to address independently –
vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire platform.

This is why patching your PHP systemwide is such a savvy
move, and why so many developers, programmers, and website/web application
owners utilizing PHP decide to move forward with a solution like Suhosin.

Engineered specifically to provide an advanced layer of
protection to PHP installations, the Suhosin patch is a dual action component
that provides a level of hardening that may not be possible through any other
manual approach.

On the one hand, Suhosin works to patch the PHP core on your
server. This allows this patch to protect against issues like format string
vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and other issues that may plague your as of
yet unsecured PHP installation.

On the other hand, Suhosin also acts as an extension to the
PHP that has already been installed on your server. This extension runs 24/7,
around-the-clock, to protect against all kinds of vulnerabilities (including
runtime vulnerabilities) as well as individual session issues while adding a
whole host of logging, filtering, and administrative tools at the same time.

Best of all, the installation of this PHP hardening patch is
about as simple and as straightforward as it gets.

All of the features it has to offer exist within its
extension module and “flipping the switch” to allow that extension to run is as
easy as activating the individual extension inside of the PHP.ini file.
Sometimes you’ll have to manually add a couple of extra Configuration
Directives to trigger the full suite of extension capabilities, but most of the
time the Suhosin patch works just as soon as the edits to the PHP.ini file go
live.

* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Eric Romang discovered a local Denial of Service vulnerability in the

handling of the 'session.save\_path' parameter in PHP's Apache 2.0

module. By setting this parameter to an invalid value in an .htaccess

file, a local user could crash the Apache server. ([CVE-2005-3319](/security/CVE-2005-3319))

A Denial of Service flaw was found in the EXIF module. By sending an

image with specially crafted EXIF data to a PHP program that

automatically evaluates them (e. g. a web gallery), a remote attacker

could cause an infinite recursion in the PHP interpreter, which caused

the web server to crash. ([CVE-2005-3353](/security/CVE-2005-3353))

Stefan Esser reported a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in the

phpinfo() function. By tricking a user into retrieving a specially

crafted URL to a PHP page that exposes phpinfo(), a remote attacker

could inject arbitrary HTML or web script into the output page and

possibly steal private data like cookies or session identifiers.

([CVE-2005-3388](/security/CVE-2005-3388))

Stefan Esser discovered a vulnerability of the parse\_str() function

when it is called with just one argument. By calling such programs

with specially crafted parameters, a remote attacker could enable the

'register\_globals' option which is normally turned off for security

reasons. Once this option is enabled, the remote attacker could

exploit other security flaws of PHP programs which are normally

protected by 'register\_globals' being deactivated. ([CVE-2005-3389](/security/CVE-2005-3389))

Stefan Esser discovered that a remote attacker could overwrite the

$GLOBALS array in PHP programs that allow file uploads and run with

'register\_globals' enabled. Depending on the particular application,

this can lead to unexpected vulnerabilities. ([CVE-2005-3390](/security/CVE-2005-3390))

The 'gd' image processing and cURL modules did not properly check

processed file names against the 'open\_basedir' and 'safe\_mode'

restrictions, which could be exploited to circumvent these

limitations. ([CVE-2005-3391](/security/CVE-2005-3391))

Another bypass of the 'open\_basedir' and 'safe\_mode' restrictions was

found in virtual() function. A local attacker could exploit this to

circumvent these restrictions with specially crafted PHP INI files

when virtual Apache 2.0 hosts are used. ([CVE-2005-3392](/security/CVE-2005-3392))

The mb\_send\_mail() function did not properly check its arguments for

invalid embedded line breaks. By setting the 'To:' field of an email

to a specially crafted value in a PHP web mail application, a remote

attacker could inject arbitrary headers into the sent email.

([CVE-2005-3883](/security/CVE-2005-3883))

# PHP 4.4.1. Release Announcement

The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate release of
[PHP 4.4.1](/downloads.php).

This is a bug fix release, which addresses some security problems too. The
security issues that this release fixes are:

* Fixed a Cross Site Scripting ([XSS](http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml))
  vulnerability in [phpinfo](/phpinfo)() that could
  lead f.e. to cookie exposure, when a phpinfo() script is accidently left
  on a production server.
* Fixed multiple safe\_mode/open\_basedir bypass vulnerabilities in ext/curl
  and ext/gd that could lead to exposure of files normally not accessible due
  to safe\_mode or open\_basedir restrictions.
* Fixed a possible $GLOBALS overwrite problem in file upload handling,
  extract() and import\_request\_variables() that could lead to unexpected
  security holes in scripts assumed secure. (For more information, see [here](http://www.hardened-php.net/globals-problem)).
* Fixed a problem when a request was terminated due to memory\_limit
  constraints during certain
  [parse\_str](/parse_str)() calls. In some cases
  this can result in register\_globals being turned on.
* Fixed an issue with trailing slashes in allowed basedirs. They were ignored
  by open\_basedir checks, so that specified basedirs were handled as prefixes
  and not as full directory names.
* Fixed an issue with calling [virtual](/virtual)()
  on Apache 2. This allowed bypassing of certain configuration directives
  like safe\_mode or open\_basedir.
* Updated to the latest pcrelib to fix a possible integer overflow
  vulnerability announced in [CAN-2005-2491](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2491).

This release also fixes 35 other defects, where the most important is the
the fix that removes a notice when passing a by-reference result of a function
as a by-reference value to another function. (Bug #[33558](http://bugs.php.net/33558)).

For a full list of changes in PHP 4.4.1, see the
[ChangeLog](/ChangeLog-4.php#4.4.1).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

php security update (RHSA-2005-838)

Original Release Date: January 31, 2006

Last Revised: September 13, 2007

Number: ASA-2006-037

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the
Apache
HTTP Web server.

A flaw was found in the way PHP registers global variables during a
file
upload request. A remote attacker could submit a carefully crafted
multipart/form-data POST request that would overwrite the $GLOBALS
array,
altering expected script behavior, and possibly leading to the execution
of
arbitrary PHP commands. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2005-3390](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3390) to
this issue.

A flaw was found in the PHP parse\_str() function. If a PHP script
passes
only one argument to the parse\_str() function, and the script can be
forced
to abort execution during operation (for example due to the memory\_limit
setting), the register\_globals may be enabled even if it is disabled in
the
PHP configuration file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2005-3389](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3389) to this issue.

A Cross-Site Scripting flaw was found in the phpinfo() function. If a
victim can be tricked into following a malicious URL to a site with a
page
displaying the phpinfo() output, it may be possible to inject javascript
or HTML content into the displayed page or steal data such as cookies.
This vulnerability only affects installations which allow users to view
the
output of the phpinfo() function. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2005-3388](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3388) to this issue.

Some Avaya System products utilize php, and are therefore affected by
these
vulnerabilities.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-838.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with php installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems. Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the
underlying operating system or applications that come with the operating
system. These vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only
product directly but may threaten the integrity of the underlying
platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform
may be. Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya recommends installing the appropriate patch from the Operating
System
Vendor (e.g. Red Hat).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

-= Security Advisory =-
Advisory: PHP Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in phpinfo()
Release Date: 2005/10/31
Last Modified: 2005/10/31
Author: Stefan Esser [sesser (at) hardened-php (dot) net [email concealed]]
Application: PHP4 <= 4.4.0
PHP5 <= 5.0.5
Severity: A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in phpinfo()
could f.e. lead to cookie data exposure if an info
script is left on a production server.
Risk: Low
Vendor Status: Vendor has released a bugfixed PHP 4 version
References: http://www.hardened-php.net/advisory\_182005.77.html
Overview:
PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.
During the development of the Hardening-Patch which adds security
hardening features to the PHP codebase, several vulnerabilities
within PHP were discovered. This advisory describes one of these
flaws concerning a weakness in the phpinfo() function, which allows
Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
Details:
The phpinfo() function outputs a large amount of information about
the current state of PHP. This includes information about PHP
compilation options and extensions, the PHP version, server
information and environment (if compiled as a module), the PHP
environment, OS version information, paths, master and local
values of configuration options and request variables, HTTP
headers, and the PHP License.
Because phpinfo() leaks a lot of information to the viewer it is
not recommended to leave a script executing phpinfo() on a
production server. However in reality phpinfo() scripts are left
open on a lot of servers. While this is already bad enough, there
is also a problem when request variables of a certain form are
displayed. With a properly crafted URL, that contains a stacked
array assignment it is f.e. possible to inject HTML code into the
output of phpinfo(), which could result in the leakage of domain
cookies (f.e. session identifiers).
Proof of Concept:
The Hardened-PHP project is not going to release exploits for any
of these vulnerabilities to the public.
Recommendation:
It is strongly recommended to never leave phpinfo() scripts on
production servers, additionally it is recommended to upgrade to
the new PHP-Releases as soon as possible, because it also fixes
a few vulnerabilities, that are rated critical. Finally we always
recommend to run PHP with the Hardening-Patch applied.

# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200511-08**

PHP suffers from multiple issues, resulting in security functions bypass,
local Denial of service, cross-site scripting or PHP variables overwrite.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-php/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.0-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **4.3.11-r4**>= **4.4.0-r4** |

| Package | **dev-php/mod\_php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.0-r8** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **4.3.11-r4**>= **4.4.0-r8** |

| Package | **dev-php/php-cgi** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.0-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **4.3.11-r5**>= **4.4.0-r5** |

### Background

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language widely used to develop
web-based applications. It can run inside a web server using the
mod\_php module or the CGI version and also stand-alone in a CLI.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found and fixed in PHP:

* a possible $GLOBALS variable overwrite problem through file
  upload handling, extract() and import\_request\_variables()
  (CVE-2005-3390)
* a local Denial of Service through the use of
  the session.save\_path option (CVE-2005-3319)
* an issue with
  trailing slashes in allowed basedirs (CVE-2005-3054)
* an issue
  with calling virtual() on Apache 2, allowing to bypass safe\_mode and
  open\_basedir restrictions (CVE-2005-3392)
* a problem when a
  request was terminated due to memory\_limit constraints during certain
  parse\_str() calls (CVE-2005-3389)
* The curl and gd modules
  allowed to bypass the safe mode open\_basedir restrictions
  (CVE-2005-3391)
* a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
  phpinfo() (CVE-2005-3388)

### Impact

Attackers could leverage these issues to exploit applications that
are assumed to be secure through the use of proper register\_globals,
safe\_mode or open\_basedir parameters. Remote attackers could also
conduct cross-site scripting attacks if a page calling phpinfo() was
available. Finally, a local attacker could cause a local Denial of
Service using malicious session.save\_path options.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround that would solve all issues at this
time.

### Resolution

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/php
```

All mod\_php users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/mod_php
```

All php-cgi users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/php-cgi
```

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
