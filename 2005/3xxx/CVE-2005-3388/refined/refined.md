{
  "CVE-2005-3388": {
    "Description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the phpinfo function in PHP 4.x up to 4.4.0 and 5.x up to 5.0.5 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted URL with a \"stacked array assignment.\"",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The phpinfo() function, which displays detailed PHP configuration, does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing request variables, specifically those using a 'stacked array assignment' in the URL.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Improper output encoding"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the output of the phpinfo() function. This can lead to:\n  * Cookie theft, including session identifiers\n  * Defacement of the page\n  * Redirection to malicious sites\n  * Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable web site",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A remote attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a 'stacked array assignment'"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker must be able to send a specially crafted URL to a target server",
      "The phpinfo() function must be accessible on the target server"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability occurs because the phpinfo() function echoes unsanitized request variables when processing URL parameters with stacked array assignments. This enables an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page. The vulnerability is considered low risk because phpinfo is typically not enabled in production environments."
