**Vulnerability Details:**

The vulnerabilities detailed concern the Hitachi IP5000 VoIP WIFI phone.  The following issues were identified:

*   **Hardcoded Administrator Password:** The phone has a default hardcoded administrator password of "0000" which is used to access administrator functions via the phone's keypad.
    *   **Weakness:** Hardcoded credentials
    *   **Impact:** An attacker with physical access to the phone can access sensitive information and modify the phone's configuration.
    *   **Attack vector:** Physical access
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Physical access to the phone.

*   **HTTP Server Vulnerabilities:** The phoneâ€™s HTTP server has two security issues:
    *   **Improper Information Disclosure:** The default index page discloses sensitive device information, including the device model, software versions, MAC address, IP address, and routing information, without authentication.
        *   **Weakness:** Information disclosure.
        *   **Impact:** An attacker can quickly identify the device and potential vulnerabilities and can obtain information for potential DoS attacks.
        *   **Attack vector:** Network access.
        *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the phone.
    *   **Unprotected Web Interface:** The web interface does not require authentication by default, allowing an attacker to change the phone configuration.
        *   **Weakness:** Missing authentication.
        *   **Impact:** An attacker can fully access the phone's configuration and modify settings, locking out the legitimate user. The password set page also does not enforce the entry of the old password, nor a confirmation of the new password.
        *   **Attack vector:** Network access.
        *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the phone.

*   **SNMP Daemon Vulnerabilities:** The SNMP v1/v2c daemon allows read/write access with any credentials.
    *  **Weakness:** Missing authentication/weak authentication.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can access and potentially modify sensitive phone configurations.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network access.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the phone.

*   **Undocumented Unidata Shell:** The phone exposes an undocumented port TCP/3390, which allows unauthenticated access to a Unidata Shell.
    *   **Weakness:** Unauthenticated access to a shell.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker may access sensitive information or perform a denial-of-service attack.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network access
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the phone.

**Workarounds:**

*   The HTTP server can be disabled through the phone's physical or web interface. Setting a password via the web interface can prevent some HTTP server issues, but does not require the entry of the current password, nor a double entry of the new password to avoid typos.
*   No workarounds appear to exist to disable the SNMP daemon or to modify the read/write strings.
*   No workaround seems to exist to disable the undocumented Unidata Shell on port TCP/3390.
