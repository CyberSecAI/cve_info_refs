   Advisory  : EPSIRT 051028-ASA01

   Title     : CISCO ASA Failover DoS Vulnerability

   Release   : November 14, 2005

   Author    : Amin Tora

   Severity  : Denial of Service

   Risk Level: Low

   Product   : CISCO Adaptive Security Appliances
               running: 7.0(0), 7.0(2), 7.0(4)

-------------------=========================-------------------

   --== Overview ==-

A possible denial of service against failover can occur due to a race
condition when there is an IP conflict or spoofed ARP response upon
active firewall failure.

   --== Details ==-

An inherent weakness in the CISCO ASA failover testing algorithm and
methodology was identified and noted to CISCO TAC and PSIRT.  In
general, the two weaknesses have been identified as a race condition
between two different failover testing processes and a lack of
authentication for failover messages between active and standby.  The
prior condition has been resolved and will be available in an upcoming
version of ASA software.  These conditions are noted in CISCO bug IDs:

  * CSCsc34022 - ASA-PIX requires improved failover testing method
  * CSCsc47618 - Authenticate all messages between Active and Standby

In an Active/Standby configuration:

When failover LAN communications goes down {i.e. cable problem,
switch/hub failure, interface failure, ASA software bug, etc}, the
standby firewall sends ARP requests on each of the segments for the IP
address of the Active firewall to see if the Active is still alive.  If
there is a response for AT LEAST ONE of the requests, the standby will
NOT become active (i.e. there is no failover).

This scenario can occur when:

1. Failover LAN interface fails AND you have a failure on any of the
other traffic carrying interfaces, EXCEPT for one.

2. Failover LAN interface fails AND you have a power failure on the
ACTIVE firewall, AND there exists an "IP address conflict" with a
traffic carrying interface.

Here, the "IP address conflict" can be another improperly configured
device with the same IP as assigned on a traffic carrying interface, or,

it could be an ARP spoof attack.

During such an outage, by sending at least one ARP response to the
standby's ARP requests an attacker can cause a "failover denial of
service" by not allowing the standby to become active - rendering the
failover solution ineffective.

The "interface-policy 1" command may or may not resolve this issue as
there is a race condition between to separate processes performing two
separate tests {i.e. one for interface failure and one for the ARP
test}.  Depends on who gets to the finish line first.

   --== Impact ==-

It is believed the severity on this issue is low. An attacker would
require direct access to the network segment AND there would have to be
some form of failure on the active firewall.

All these conditions must be met for an attacker to succeed with the
denial of service:

       1. Have some form of access to a local segment of the firewalls:

		A. Direct physical access to network segment to connect
		their own system (i.e insider) OR

		B. Somehow inject continuous ARP reply packets onto the
		segment via tunneling, etc. OR

		C. Have access to a compromised host on that segment

       2. Have a failure on the primary.

       3. Respond with spoofed ARP replies to the standby's ARP request
       test.

The likelihood that all these conditions can be met is minimal but not
impossible as other attack methods may prove effective.

   --== Mitigation ==-

1. Prevent or correct IP address conflicts on the traffic carrying
segments.

2. The firewall will detect and log IP address conflicts with system
log message:

%PIX-4-405001: Received ARP response collision from <firewall IP
address/mac address of device with duplicate IP address> on interface
<firewall interface>.

3. Restrict via port security and/or filter ARP communications with
ACL's based on IP type 0x0806 and 0x0835.

Cisco Response
==============
This is Cisco PSIRT's response to the statements made by Amin Tora in
his
message: [ADVISORY] CISCO ASA Failover DoS Vulnerability, posted on
November 14, 2005.
The original email is available at
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/416544/30/0/threaded
Attached is a cleartext, PGP signed version of this same email.
This issue is being tracked by two Cisco Bug IDs:
\* CSCsc34022 -- ASA-PIX requires improved failover testing method
This DDTS has been resolved and the fix will be available in an upcoming
version of software. The standby firewall now validates both the IP
address and
MAC address of all active firewall interfaces while conducting failover
ARP
testing.
\* CSCsc47618 -- Authenticate all messages between Active and Standby
Firewalls
This DDTS is under investigation and while not resolved there is a
workaround to
mitigate the issue.
We would like to thank Amin Tora for reporting this issue to us.
We greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with researchers on
security
vulnerabilities, and welcome the opportunity to review and assist in
product
reports.
Additional Information
======================
The Release Note Enclosure for CSCsc34022 states:
+------------------------------------------------
Symptom:
+-------
The Standby firewall in failover pair may not take over when the Active
firewall loses power or crashes.
Conditions:
+----------
For this issue to occur, a duplicate IP address matching one of the
active
firewall's IP addresses must be present on the same network subnet as
the
firewalls when the active firewall loses power or crashes.
When the active firewall loses power or crashes, the standby firewall's
LAN
failover interface will lose connectivity with the active firewall. This
causes
the standby firewall to ARP for the IP address of each active firewall
interface. Because the active firewall is now unreachable, the duplicate
IP
address matching the active firewall will cause the standby firewall to
receive
a reply to the ARP attempt. Upon receiving the erroneous ARP reply, the
standby firewall will believe that the active firewall is still
reachable and
prevent the standby firewall from taking over.
Due to the timing of two concurrent failover tests, there are still
cases where
the standby firewall will be able to determine that the active firewall
is down
even when a duplicate IP address is present; however, this can not be
guaranteed.
Workaround:
+----------
Connecting the LAN failover interfaces of the firewalls to switch ports
may
minimize but not completely mitigate the chance that an otherwise active
firewall will lose connectivity to its LAN failover interface.
Preventing or correcting IP addresses that duplicate the firewall IP
addresses
is a complete workaround for this issue.
The firewall will detect and log duplicate IP addresses with system log
message:
%PIX-4-405001: Received ARP response collision from <firewall IP
address/mac
address of device with duplicate IP address> on interface <firewall
interface>.

The Release Note Enclosure for CSCsc47618 states:
+------------------------------------------------
Symptom:
+-------
An attacker who can spoof the IP address and MAC address of an active
firewall's interface may prevent failover from occurring.
Conditions:
+----------
When the active firewall loses power or crashes, the standby firewall's
LAN
failover interface will lose connectivity with the active firewall. This
causes
the standby firewall to ARP for the IP address of each active firewall
interface. The standby firewall will only accept the ARP response if the
source
MAC address matches the active firewall's interface MAC address. An
attacker
who can spoof the IP address and MAC address of the active firewall's
interface
can lead the standby firewall to believe that the active firewall is
still
reachable and prevent the standby firewall from taking over.
Workaround:
+----------
Configure port security on all switch ports configured to be in the same
vlans
as the active and standby firewalls enabled interfaces. Port security
must not
be enabled on the switch ports connected to the active and standby
firewalls
interfaces.
Port security will prevent an attacker from spoofing the active
firewall's
interface MAC address allowing failover to occur normally.
This configuration should be tested before being enabled in a production
environment.

the standby firewall to ARP for the IP address of each active firewall
interface. Because the active firewall is now unreachable, the duplicate
IP
address matching the active firewall will cause the standby firewall to
receive
a reply to the ARP attempt. Upon receiving the erroneous  ARP reply, the
standby firewall will believe that the active firewall is still
reachable and
prevent the standby firewall from taking over.

Due to the timing of two concurrent failover tests, there are still
cases where
the standby firewall will be able to determine that the active firewall
is down
even when a duplicate IP address is present; however, this can not be
guaranteed.

Workaround:
+----------

Connecting the LAN failover interfaces of the firewalls to switch ports
may
minimize but not completely mitigate the chance that an otherwise active
firewall will lose connectivity to its LAN failover interface.

Preventing or correcting IP addresses that duplicate the firewall IP
addresses
is a complete workaround for this issue.

The firewall will detect and log duplicate IP addresses with system log
message:

%PIX-4-405001: Received ARP response collision from <firewall IP
address/mac
address of device with duplicate IP address> on interface <firewall
interface>.

The Release Note Enclosure for CSCsc47618 states:
+------------------------------------------------

Symptom:
+-------

An attacker who can spoof the IP address and MAC address of an active
firewall's interface may prevent failover from occurring.

Conditions:
+----------

When the active firewall loses power or crashes, the standby firewall's
LAN
failover interface will lose connectivity with the active firewall. This
causes
the standby firewall to ARP for the IP address of each active firewall
interface. The standby firewall will only accept the ARP response if the
source
MAC address matches the active firewall's interface MAC address. An
attacker
who can spoof the IP address and MAC address of the active firewall's
interface
can lead the standby firewall to believe that the active firewall is
still
reachable and prevent the standby firewall from taking over.

Workaround:
+----------

Configure port security on all switch ports configured to be in the same
vlans
as the active and standby firewalls enabled interfaces. Port security
must not
be enabled on the switch ports connected to the active and standby
firewalls
interfaces.

Port security will prevent an attacker from spoofing the active
firewall's
interface MAC address allowing failover to occur normally.

This configuration should be tested before being enabled in a production
environment.

Cisco Response
==============

This is Cisco PSIRT's response to the statements made by Amin Tora in his
message: [ADVISORY] CISCO ASA Failover DoS Vulnerability, posted on
November 14, 2005.

The original email is available at
<http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/416544/30/0/threaded>

This issue is being tracked by two Cisco Bug IDs:

 * CSCsc34022 -- ASA-PIX requires improved failover testing method

This DDTS has been resolved and the fix will be available in an upcoming
version of software. The standby firewall now validates both the IP address and
MAC address of all active firewall interfaces while conducting failover ARP
testing.

 * CSCsc47618 -- Authenticate all messages between Active and Standby Firewalls

This DDTS is under investigation and while not resolved there is a workaround to
mitigate the issue.

We would like to thank Amin Tora for reporting this issue to us.

We greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with researchers on security
vulnerabilities, and welcome the opportunity to review and assist in product
reports.

Additional Information
======================

The Release Note Enclosure for CSCsc34022 states:
+------------------------------------------------

Symptom:
+-------

The Standby firewall in failover pair may not take over when the Active
firewall loses power or crashes.

Conditions:
+----------

For this issue to occur, a duplicate IP address matching one of the active
firewall's IP addresses must be present on the same network subnet as the
firewalls when the active firewall loses power or crashes.

When the active firewall loses power or crashes, the standby firewall's LAN
failover interface will lose connectivity with the active firewall. This causes
the standby firewall to ARP for the IP address of each active firewall
interface. Because the active firewall is now unreachable, the duplicate IP
address matching the active firewall will cause the standby firewall to receive
a reply to the ARP attempt. Upon receiving the erroneous  ARP reply, the
standby firewall will believe that the active firewall is still reachable and
prevent the standby firewall from taking over.

Due to the timing of two concurrent failover tests, there are still cases where
the standby firewall will be able to determine that the active firewall is down
even when a duplicate IP address is present; however, this can not be
guaranteed.

Workaround:

Connecting the LAN failover interfaces of the firewalls to switch ports may
minimize but not completely mitigate the chance that an otherwise active
firewall will lose connectivity to its LAN failover interface.

is a complete workaround for this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
