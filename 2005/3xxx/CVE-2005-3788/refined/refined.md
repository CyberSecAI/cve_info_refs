{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the Cisco ASA failover testing algorithm, combined with a lack of authentication for failover messages between active and standby firewalls. This allows an attacker to disrupt the failover process.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race condition between two failover testing processes.",
        "Lack of authentication for failover messages."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service by preventing the standby firewall from becoming active during a failover event, rendering the failover solution ineffective.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "ARP spoofing attack.",
         "IP address conflict on the network segment."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": [
        "Direct access to the network segment.",
        "Ability to send spoofed ARP replies.",
        "A failure condition on the active firewall (e.g., power failure, crash)."
