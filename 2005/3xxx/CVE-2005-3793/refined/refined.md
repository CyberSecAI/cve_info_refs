Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in Affiliate Network Pro v7.2:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Lack of input validation for user-supplied data within SQL queries. Specifically, the `$login` and `$passwd` variables are used directly in SQL queries in `admin/admin_validate_login.php` and `login_validate.php` without proper sanitization.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Insufficient validation of the `$_POST['number']` parameter in `admin/admin_options_manage.php`, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary code into the `/includes/constants.php` file.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Lack of output sanitization of the `$Err` variable in `/admin/index.php`, and several input fields in `/index.php?Act=register`, allowing the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.
*   **Path Disclosure:** Inadequate checks on file access leading to disclosure of the application path via direct access to files like `togateway.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (Multiple instances):**
    *   `admin/admin_validate_login.php`:  Unsanitized input in the login form allows SQL injection.
    *   `login_validate.php`: Unsanitized input in the login form for regular users also allows SQL injection.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
    *   `admin/admin_options_manage.php`: Allows arbitrary code injection into the `/includes/constants.php` file.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   `admin/index.php`: Unsanitized output of the error variable allows XSS.
    *   `index.php?Act=register`: Unsanitized form fields allow XSS.
*   **Path Disclosure:**
    *   `togateway.php`: Direct access reveals the application's path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Bypass authentication to gain administrative access or access to user accounts.
    *   Potentially read, modify, or delete data within the database.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**
    *   Full control of the web server and application by injecting and executing arbitrary PHP code.
    *   Possible system compromise.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   Execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser.
    *   Session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Path Disclosure:**
    *   Exposing the server's internal path structure could aid in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Submitting crafted SQL code within the login forms via the `login` and `password` fields in the specified files.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Submitting malicious code via the `number` parameter in the `admin/admin_options_manage.php` page.
*  **XSS:** Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript in the `Err` parameter of `/admin/index.php`, or in form fields in `/index.php?Act=register`
*   **Path Disclosure:** Direct access to files via a web browser that should not be directly accessible

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** No special privileges are required; an attacker only needs network access to the web application.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker needs to access the `admin/admin_options_manage.php` page, implying administrative rights or compromised credentials.
*   **XSS:** No special privileges are required; an attacker only needs network access to the web application.
*   **Path Disclosure:**  No special privileges are required; an attacker only needs network access to the web application.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability report also mentions that there are more SQL injection vulnerabilities in other files of the application.
* The advisory suggests turning on `magic_quotes_gpc` or using `addslashes()` on user submitted variables to fix the vulnerabilities.
