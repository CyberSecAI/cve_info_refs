How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

John Barber reported a problem where, if the system administrator misconfigures **`rssh`** by providing two few access bits in the configuration file, the user will be given default permissions (scp) to the entire system, potentially circumventing any configured chroot. Fixing this required a behavior change: In the past, using **`rssh`** without a config file would give all users default access to use scp on an unchrooted system. In order to correct the reported bug, this feature has been eliminated, and you must now have a valid configuration file. If no config file exists, all users will be locked out. Maarten van der Schrieck noticed a bug where, under conditions which are too far-fetched to describe, the rssh\_chroot\_helper could crash due to calling fgets with a null pointer. **This can not occur with a normal, proper installation of rssh.** The code path that causes this can only be reached if the system administrator deliberately installs **`rssh`** improperly, and the hoops through which one must jump to get it to occur are substantial, so the security impact here is basically nil. But it is a legitimate bug, so I fixed it nonetheless.Dec 18, 2005 Max Vozeler has reported a problem whereby **`rssh`** can allow users who have shell access to systems where rssh is installed (and rssh\_chroot\_helper is installed SUID) to gain root access to the system, due to the ability to chroot to arbitrary locations. There are a lot of potentially mitigating factors, but to be safe you should upgrade immediately.  The 2.3.0 release of **`rssh`** fixes this problem, by forcing the chroot helper to re-parse the config file to decide where to chroot(2) to. Users with shell access to the system can not subvert the chroot location, and may not be able to chroot at all depending on the configuration of rssh, which solves the problem. Dec 3, 2004 Jason Wies has reported a problem whereby **`rssh`** can be bypassed in conjunction with **`scp`**, **`rdist`**, and **`rsync`**. The source of the problem is that these commands have command-line options which trigger execution of arbitrary programs.  The 2.2.3 release of **`rssh`** fixes this problem, by parsing the command line passed to the `exec()`'d program, making sure it does not contain command line options which allow arbitrary execution of programs. Oct 23, 2004 Florian Schilhabel has identified a format string bug which can allow an attacker to run arbitrary code from an account configured to use **`rssh`**. In general the risk is low, as in most cases the user can only compromise their own account. The risk is mittigated by the fact that before this bug can be exploited, the user must log in successfully through **`ssh`**. This means that either the user is known, or that the system is already compromised.  However, on some older systems with broken implementations of the `setuid()` family of functions, a root compromise may be possible with certain configurations of rssh. Specifically, if rssh is configured to use a chroot jail, it will `exec()` **`rssh_chroot_helper`**, which must be setuid root in order to call chroot(). Normally, **`rssh_chroot_helper`** calls `setuid(getuid())` and drops privileges before any of the logging functions are called, making a root compromise impossible on most systems. However, some older systems which handle saved UIDs improperly may be vulnerable to a root compromise. Linux in particular is not vulnerable to this, nor should modern POSIX-compliant Unix variants be. POSIX defines that the `setuid()` system call will set all UIDs (UID, saved UID, and effective UID) the specified UID if it is called with root privileges. ***Therefore in general, a root compromise is not possible***, and I am not specifically aware of any systems on which one is possible.  The 2.2.2 release of **`rssh`** fixes this string format vulnerability. I have also gone over the code to make sure that no other such vulnerabilities exist. In addition to fixing this problem, **`rssh`** contains some new code to help identify certain problems for debugging problems when **`rssh`** fails. Additional logging of error conditions is performed. May 22, 2004 There is a bug in **`rssh 2.0 - 2.1.x`** which allows a user to gather information outside of a chrooted jail unintentionally. The bug was reported by William McCaw, to whom I am indebted. The latest release of **`rssh`** fixes this problem, and also improves support for some non-openssh sftp clients. Additionally, it extends **`rssh`** by allowing **`cvs`**, **`rsync`**, and **`rdist`**.  The cause of the problem identified by Mr. McCaw is that rssh expanded command-line arguments prior to entering the chroot jail. Please note that for all but the most sensitive and security-concious sites, ***this bug is not a serious issue***. This bug ***does not*** allow a user to access any of the files outside the jail, but can allow them to discover what files are in a directory which is outside the jail, if their credentials on the server would normally allow them read/execute access in the specified directory.  For example (from William's bug report), if a user has an account on a server machine which restricts them into a jail using **`rssh`**, the user can use the following command to access the server and see what files exist in the `/etc` directory:  ```  	scp target:/etc/* .  ```  The results of this command will look something like this:  ```  	scp: /etc/DIR_COLORS: No such file or directory 	scp: /etc/HOSTNAME: No such file or directory 	scp: /etc/X11: No such file or directory 	scp: /etc/adjtime: No such file or directory 	[ ... ] 	ld.so.cache                                  100%  675     0.0KB/s 00:00 	ld.so.conf                                   100%    0     0.0KB/s 00:00 	[ ... ] 	passwd                                       100%   51     0.0KB/s 00:00 	[ ... ] 	scp: /etc/termcap-Linux: No such file or directory 	scp: /etc/updatedb.conf: No such file or directory 	scp: /etc/warnquota.conf-sample: No such file or directory 	scp: /etc/xml: No such file or directory  ```  The files which succeed in copying exist inside the chroot jail, and thus should be harmless. All of the files which produce an error message exist in the system's `/etc` directory, but do not exist inside the chroot jail. The user is placed in the jail before access to any of these files is attempted, so again, it is not possible to access them. For many sites, this is not a serious issue. However if it is important at your site that users not be able to know about any files which exist outside the chroot jail, then you should upgrade as soon as possible.  The 2.2.0 version of **`rssh`** was never actually released. It fixed the problem in question, but was mistakenly released missing some code for parsing per-user options. The 2.2.1 release corrects that problem, and should be the final release of **`rssh`**. No further development is planned. Jul 17 2003 **Note:** this page is *mostly* outdated. If you are using the latest **`rssh`** with OpenSSH >= 3.5, all you need to know is that you should configure `PermitUserEnvironment` in your `sshd_config` to **no**. If you do not do this, it will be possible for users to circumvent **`rssh`**. It is important to understand that this is ***not*** because of any flaw in **`rssh`**. Keep reading for details... Aug 22 2002 **Summary** The details of the problem, including a description of how a user might exploit the problem, are discussed [below](#details). It is currently not completely possible to prevent users from circumventing **`rssh`** to gain access to the restricted system, unless one of two precautions is taken:  * the **`rssh`** binary is compiled statically* efforts are made to prevent the restricted users' environment     files from being user-modifiable  In practice, the latter means that an rssh user's home directory must not be writable to the user, nor must their .ssh directory (if it exists) be writable. It is not sufficient to limit the .ssh directory, as users could use sftp to remove or rename the .ssh directory, and create a new one which is writable by them. Note that this means they can not own their home directory either, as if they do they can use sftp to chmod it. Alternately on Linux systems using file systems which support the chattr command, you could `chattr +i` the .ssh directory.  For this reason, as of rssh v0.9.3, the binary is compiled statically by default. Note that this results in a very large binary (>400k), unlike when **`rssh`** is compiled and linked dynamically. Since v1.0.0, there is a configure option to disable static linking. See the output of configure --help for details.  Note that it appears to be impossible to build a working **rssh** statically on Solaris, though it may work if you are not running it on systems patched to prevent executable stacks and/or heaps. Building static binaries on Solaris is *hard*, because some of their static library calls reference the `dlopen()` family of functions, which strikes me as incredibly brain-dead. In many cases, it can be worked around by providing stub functions for that family of functions, but some who've tried to do this with **`rssh`** have reported that the resulting binary segfaults. If you are trying to use rssh on Solaris, I strongly suggest you upgrade to OpenSSH 3.5 (see below). Otherwise, you will have to manually disable static compilation at configure time, and risk your users circumventing **`rssh`**.  **Details** Please note, the flaw is not in **`rssh`** itself. The problem is that the OpenSSH Project's sshd (in versions prior to OpenSSH 3.5) reads `$HOME/.ssh/environment` when a user first connects (regardless of whether it's via ssh, scp, or sftp), allowing users to set variables in their environment. A user could scp a file to that location containing a line that sets variables such as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and/or `LD_PRELOAD`, allowing the user to cause binaries `exec()`'d by the sshd daemon to be dynamically linked against libraries of their choosing. This means that users can cause rssh itself to execute arbitrary code, and the only thing that you can do to prevent this attack is to control users' environments, and make absolutely sure they can not write to their .ssh directory.  In OpenSSH 3.4 and before, there is no way to prevent user environment files from being sourced. OpenSSH 3.5 is now released, which includes the option `PermitUserEnvironment` which will prevent this attack without having to resort to restricting permissions.  Additionally, according to the `sshd(8)` man page from at least some releases of OpenSSH, the commands listed in the `$HOME/.ssh/rc` file are executed with `/bin/sh` instead of the user's defined shell. This appears not to be the case on systems I had available to test on, despite the man page; commands were executed using the user's configured shell (**`rssh`**), which did not allow the execution. However if it is true on your system, then a malicious user may be able to circumvent rssh by uploading a file to `$HOME/.ssh/rc` which will be executed by `/bin/sh` on that system.  If you wish to be certain that **`rssh`** will prevent your users from gaining shell access (without restricting ownerships and permissions of users' home directories, and/or compiling statically), I recommend that you upgrade to OpenSSH 3.5 now that it has become available. Be sure that sshd has the `PermitUserEnvironment` option set to no. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hey Jesus,

rssh 2.3.0 has been released by Derek to fix the arbitrary chroot()
problem and privilege escalation we've mailed about ([CVE-2005-3345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3345))

Having rssh installed and rssh_chroot_helper setuid root is sufficient
for this bug to be exploitable, hence severity critical.

The package Derek has put in the web page seems to be broken, and the patch I
applied from him does effectively break the compilation of the package, so I
am looking into the problem right now.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Affected Software: rssh - all versions prior to 2.3.0
Vulnerability: local user privilege escalation
Severity: \*CRITICAL\*
Impact: local users can gain root access
Solution: Please upgrade to v2.3.1
Summary
-------
rssh is a restricted shell which allows a system administrator to
limit users' access to a system via SSH to scp, sftp, rsync, rdist,
and cvs. It also allows the system administrator the ability to
chroot users to a configurable location.
\* PLEASE NOTE \*
This problem was fixed in 2.3.0, but there is another small bug (not
security-related) in that version which prompted me to release 2.3.1
today. I will announce that separately in appropriate channels.
Please upgrade to the 2.3.1 release, not the 2.3.0 release.
Max Vozeler reported a flaw in the design of rssh\_chroot\_helper
whereby it can be exploited to chroot to arbitrary directories and
thereby gain root access. If rssh is installed on a system, and
non-trusted users on that system have access which is not protected by
rssh (i.e. they have full shell access), then they can use
rssh\_chroot\_helper to chroot to arbitrary locations in the file system,
and thereby gain root access.
Workaround
----------
By careful configuration of file system mounts, it is possible to
avoid this problem; but doing so requires a fair amount of contortion
which will be difficult to re-engineer after an existing installation
has already been configured. The exploit requires the user to be able
to write executables in the directory they are chrooting to, and
create hard links to SUID binaries within that directory structure, so
by preventing either of these two things, the exploit will be foiled.
System administrators can accomplish this by careful configuration of
filesystem permissions, mount points, and mount options (such as
no\_exec, no\_suid, etc.). I will not go into details since the far
better solution is to upgrade.
Fix
---
The 2.3.0 release of rssh fixes this problem by forcing the chroot
helper program to re-parse the config file instead of allowing the
chroot home to be specified on the command line. Thus users not
listed can not use it to chroot (or will chroot to the default
location specified by the sysadmin), and users who are listed will be
chrooted to the directories where they are supposed to go only.
This version also fixes an unrelated bug which causes
rssh\_chroot\_helper to crash on the ia64 architecture (and possibly
others). Numerous people reported a problem with the way
va\_start/va\_end was used in log.c, which causes a segfault on 64-bit
Linux platforms. It is believed that this bug is not exploitable,
since no code in this module is ever executed with root privileges.
However this is also fixed in this release.
Thanks

# rssh: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200512-15**

Local users could gain root privileges by chrooting into arbitrary
directories.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-shells/rssh** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.3.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.0** |

### Background

rssh is a restricted shell, allowing only a few commands like scp
or sftp. It is often used as a complement to OpenSSH to provide limited
access to users.

### Description

Max Vozeler discovered that the rssh\_chroot\_helper command allows
local users to chroot into arbitrary directories.

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain root
privileges by chrooting into arbitrary directories.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All rssh users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-shells/rssh-2.3.0"
```
