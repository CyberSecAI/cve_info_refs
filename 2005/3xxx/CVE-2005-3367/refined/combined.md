SparkleBlog is prone to HTMl injection attacks. It is possible for a malicious \
SparkleBlog user to inject hostile HTML script code into the commentary via form \
fields. This code may be rendered in the browser of a web user who views the \
commentary of SparkleBlog. SparkleBlog does not adequately filter HTMl tags from \
various fields. This may enable an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into \
pages that are generated by SparkleBlog  example:
put <script>alert('test')</script> in the "name:" tag in \
<http://localhost/journal.php?id=1>
