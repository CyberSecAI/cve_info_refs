**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insufficient filtering of HTML tags in various form fields within SparkleBlog. Specifically, the `name` field in `journal.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious HTML or script code can be injected into the application.

    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing sensitive information (cookies, etc.).
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack: The attacker can inject the malicious code remotely via a crafted request.
- The `name` parameter within the `journal.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
