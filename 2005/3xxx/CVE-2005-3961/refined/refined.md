Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3961:

**Summary:** CVE-2005-3961 describes a local file overwrite vulnerability in WebCalendar due to missing input sanitization.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `export_handler.php` file. Specifically, the `id` and `format` parameters, received through HTTP POST, are used in file name generation without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Overwrite:** The `export_handler.php` script allows an attacker to specify the `id` parameter, which is then incorporated into the filename of an exported file. Since no checks are done on the value of id, a malicious id such as "../../../../evilfile" will allow an attacker to write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.  This is then paired with an unchecked format which determines which type of file is written.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the server, leading to potential compromise of the system by overwriting critical configuration files or scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to `export_handler.php`.
- Specifically, the attacker would control the `id` and `format` parameters to craft a malicious filename.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server where WebCalendar is installed.
- No specific prior knowledge of user or session is required, this can be done anonymously if the vulnerable script is exposed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified in WebCalendar version 1.0.1.
- The advisory mentions that input validation will fix the vulnerability.
- The vendor quickly responded and fixed 3 of the 4 issues (including this one) reported in the REL_1_0_0 branch of CVS.
- The report identifies that the SQL Injection vulnerability in `export_handler.php` file uses the same unchecked vars as the local file overwrite.
