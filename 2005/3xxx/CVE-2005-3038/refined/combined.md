As the result this code                       will not be sent to gateway with the automatic recurring                       transactions. However this code will be allowed                       to enter at the time of making manual payment.* The trouble ticket response                         email now doesn't contain the response.

This makes sure that communication                         chain is not broken at anytime.* There is one major interface                           modification to webadmin control panel.

The plan selection box is as usual on top left corner.   Fixes in Hotfix 1.1   * Fixed a bug where false   POP boxes quota error was thrown on plan selling.* Fix a bug in disk usage     calculation where when SQL database was on remote     it was counted multiple times for each of the sold     plan.* Fix a bug on Chinese operating       system where ACL permissions were not properly setup       on folders resulting in FTP failure.* Fixed a security issue         in FrontPage Extensions installation where with         the change of URL parameters one could install/uninstall         extensions on others websites.* Fixed a bug where mail           domain quota was not checked in the webadmin control           panel. * Fixed a bug in ticketing             system where each response time was stamped with             ticket submission time.* Fixed a bug where IPs of               1st NIC card were displayed only.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
