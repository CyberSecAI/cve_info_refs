      "is_related": true,
      "details": "Multiple Techno Dreams scripts (Announcement, Guestbook, Mailing List, and WebDirectory) are vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Specifically, the 'userid' parameter in /admin/login.asp (for Announcement, Guestbook, and WebDirectory) and /login.asp (for Mailing List) is vulnerable. An attacker can inject SQL commands into this parameter to bypass authentication and log in as a low-level user.",

        "Techno Dreams Announcement Script",
        "Techno Dreams Guestbook Script",
        "Techno Dreams Mailing List Script",

      ],
     "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation of the 'userid' parameter in the login scripts.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Authentication bypass, allowing an attacker to log in as a low-level user and potentially gain further access or control over the affected applications and their data.",
      "attack_vectors": "Remote, via HTTP requests to the login scripts.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the affected login pages."
