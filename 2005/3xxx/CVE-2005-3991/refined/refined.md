A remote attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML code. This could allow them to:
* Obtain cookie-based credentials.
* Execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is carried out via crafted URLs by manipulating the vulnerable parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to the victim, typically by enticing the victim to click on a malicious link. No authentication is required.
