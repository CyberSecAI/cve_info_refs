======================================================================
1) Affected Software

ATutor 1.5.1-pl1

Other versions may also be affected.

======================================================================
2) Severity

Rating: Highly critical
Impact: System access, exposure of sensitive information, and
        cross-site scripting
Where:  Remote

======================================================================
3) Vendor's Description of Software

ATutor is an Open Source Web-based Learning Content Management System
(LCMS) designed with accessibility and adaptability in mind.

Product link:
<http://atutor.ca/>

======================================================================
4) Description of Vulnerabilities

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in ATutor, which
can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting
attacks, disclose sensitive information, and compromise a vulnerable
system.

1) Input passed to the "addslashes", "asc", and "desc" parameters in
"include/html/forum.inc.php" isn't properly verified, before it is
used to create a function call. This can be exploited to call an
arbitrary PHP function with an arbitrary parameter (e.g. execute
arbitrary shell commands with the "exec" function).

Examples:
http://[host]/include/html/forum.inc.php?
addslashes=[function]&asc=[parameter]
http://[host]/include/html/forum.inc.php?
addslashes=[function]&desc=[parameter]

Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

2) Input passed to the "section" parameter in "body_header.inc.php"
and "print.php" isn't properly verified, before it is used to include
files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local
resources.

Examples:
http://[host]/documentation/common/body_header.inc.php?
section=[file]%00
http://[host]/documentation/common/print.php?section=[file]%00

Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled
and that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

3) Input passed to the "_base_href" parameter in
"admin/translate.php", the "_base_path" parameter in
"include/html/editor_tabs/news.inc.php", and the "p" parameter in
"documentation/add_note.php" isn't properly sanitised before being
returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary
HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an
affected site.

The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 1.5.1-pl1. Other
versions may also be affected.

======================================================================
5) Solution

Apply patch.
<http://atutor.ca/view/3/6158/1.html>

The fixes will also be included in the upcoming 1.5.2 version.

======================================================================
6) Time Table

10/10/2005 - Vulnerability discovered.
11/10/2005 - Vendor notified.
27/10/2005 - Vendor releases patch.
27/10/2005 - Public disclosure.

======================================================================
7) Credits

Discovered by Andreas Sandblad, Secunia Research.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
