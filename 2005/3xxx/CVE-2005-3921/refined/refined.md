Summary:
The Cisco IOS HTTP server is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability. By injecting HTML code into dynamically generated output, attackers can potentially execute malicious commands or conduct cross-site scripting attacks.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of HTML code within the output of dynamically generated content, specifically from commands like "show buffers". This allows injected HTML to be interpreted by the client browser.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Command Injection: Arbitrary HTML code can be inserted into dynamically generated web pages.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The injected HTML code can be interpreted by the client browser, potentially leading to the execution of malicious commands or other XSS attacks.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
- Execute commands on the device.
- Gain administrative privileges, depending on the privileges of the authenticated user viewing the manipulated content.
- Reset the enable password of the device.

Attack vectors:
- Injecting HTML code through user input fields (e.g., telnet login) which is later reflected in the output of "show" commands accessed via the web interface.
- Injecting malicious HTML code into network packets (e.g., ICMP packets) which are then stored in memory buffers and displayed via the web interface.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML code into the data stream that the IOS device will store in its memory buffers. This can be achieved through:
    - Having access to a telnet connection to the IOS device and entering commands with the malicious payload
    - Sending crafted network packets to the device containing the malicious payload
- The attacker does not need direct access to the web interface.
- The user must then browse a page containing the injected HTML in order for the attack to be triggered.
