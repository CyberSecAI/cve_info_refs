Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `Popular URL` feature in Krusader stored passwords in cleartext within the `krusaderrc` configuration file. This occurred when users entered URLs with embedded credentials (e.g., `protocol://user:password@hostname`) directly into the panel's URL field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cleartext Storage:** Passwords were saved in an unencrypted format within a configuration file.
- **Insecure URL Handling:** The application did not properly sanitize or handle URLs containing credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** Attackers gaining access to the `krusaderrc` file could retrieve user credentials for various services. This would allow attackers to access remote servers using stolen passwords.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local File Access:** An attacker needs read access to the `krusaderrc` file.  This could be achieved through various means, including:
    - Compromising the user's account.
    - Exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain file access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the configuration file:** The attacker must be able to read the `krusaderrc` file. Since this file is typically stored within a user's home directory, an attacker must either compromise the user's account or gain access through another exploit.
- **Knowledge of the location of the configuration file:** The attacker should know where the configuration file is stored to access it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Krusader versions 1.60.0 and 1.70.0-beta1.
- The issue was fixed in Krusader version 1.70.0-1 by modifying the `popularurls.cpp` file to use `prettyURL()` instead of `url()` when saving URLs and using `KURL::fromPathOrURL()` to load URLs.
- The `krusaderrc` file is normally only accessible by the owner but still presents a security risk.
- The vulnerability was addressed by a patch committed to the Krusader CVS repository and released in version 1.60.1
- Debian bug report #336169 tracks this vulnerability.
- There is a note that CVE-2005-3856 seems to be a duplicate of CVE-2006-3816.
