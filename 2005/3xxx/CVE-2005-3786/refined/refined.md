  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "Insufficient access control in ZENworks' Remote Diagnostics functionality within ConsoleOne.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate authorization checks",
      "Access control bypass"
    ],
    "Impact": "Non-administrative users could access and potentially perform Remote Diagnostics functions, which are intended for administrators only.",
    "Attack vectors": "By using the ConsoleOne interface, a regular user could access the Remote Diagnostics option.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A regular user account on the ZENworks system. No elevated privileges are needed to access the vulnerable functionality."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The provided content indicates that while other remote management options correctly restricted non-admin access with an error message, the Remote Diagnostics function did not, allowing unauthorized access. The issue was addressed in subsequent patches and support packs for affected ZENworks versions. Specific versions affected are ZENworks for Servers 3.0.2, ZENworks Desktop Management 6.5 Support Pack 2, and ZENworks 7 Desktop Management."
