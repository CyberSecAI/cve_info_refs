{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure paths are introduced into the list of directories searched for libraries at runtime. Additionally, packages depending on the MakeMaker Perl module may have incorrectly copied the LD_RUN_PATH into the DT_RPATH.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure RUNPATH",
    "Incorrect LD_RUN_PATH to DT_RPATH copying"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker who is a member of the 'portage' group could create a malicious shared object in the Portage temporary build directory that would be loaded at runtime by a dependent executable, potentially resulting in privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a member of the 'portage' group and able to create files in the Portage temporary build directory."
