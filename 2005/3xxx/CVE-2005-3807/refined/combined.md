# USN-231-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

23 December 2005

Linux kernel vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Rudolf Polzer reported an abuse of the 'loadkeys' command. By

redefining one or more keys and tricking another user (like root) into

logging in on a text console and typing something that involves the

redefined keys, a local user could cause execution of arbitrary

commands with the privileges of the target user. The updated kernel

restricts the usage of 'loadkeys' to root. ([CVE-2005-3257](/security/CVE-2005-3257))

The ptrace() system call did not correctly check whether a process

tried to attach to itself. A local attacker could exploit this to

cause a kernel crash. ([CVE-2005-3783](/security/CVE-2005-3783))

A Denial of Service vulnerability was found in the handler that

automatically cleans up and terminates child processes that are not

correctly handled by their parent process ("auto-reaper"). The check

did not correctly handle processes which were currently traced by

another process. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel

crash. ([CVE-2005-3784](/security/CVE-2005-3784))

A locking problem was discovered in the POSIX timer cleanup handling

on process exit. A local attacker could exploit this to cause the

machine to hang (Denial of Service). This flaw only affects

multiprocessor (SMP) systems. ([CVE-2005-3805](/security/CVE-2005-3805))

A Denial of Service vulnerability was discovered in the IPv6 flowlabel

handling code. By invoking setsockopt(IPV6\_FLOWLABEL\_MGR) in a special

way, a local attacker could cause memory corruption which eventually

led to a kernel crash. ([CVE-2005-3806](/security/CVE-2005-3806))

A memory leak was discovered in the VFS lease handling. These

operations are commonly executed by the Samba server, which led to

steady memory exhaustion. By repeatedly triggering the affected

operations in quick succession, a local attacker could exploit this to

drain all memory, which leads to a Denial of Service. ([CVE-2005-3807](/security/CVE-2005-3807))

An integer overflow was discovered in the

invalidate\_inode\_pages2\_range() function. By issuing 64-bit mmap calls

on a 32 bit system, a local user could exploit this to crash the

machine, thereby causing Denial of Service. This flaw does not affect

the amd64 platform, and does only affect Ubuntu 5.10. ([CVE-2005-3808](/security/CVE-2005-3808))

Ollie Wild discovered a memory leak in the icmp\_push\_reply() function.

By sending a large amount of specially crafted packets, a remote

attacker could exploit this to drain all memory, which eventually

leads to a Denial of Service. ([CVE-2005-3848](/security/CVE-2005-3848))

Chris Wrigth found a Denial of Service vulnerability in the

time\_out\_leases() function. By allocating a large number of VFS file

lock leases and having them timeout at the same time, a large number

of 'printk' debugging statements was generated at the same time, which

could exhaust kernel memory. ([CVE-2005-3857](/security/CVE-2005-3857))

Patrick McHardy discovered a memory leak in the ip6\_input\_finish()

function. A remote attacker could exploit this by sending specially

crafted IPv6 packets, which would eventually drain all available

kernel memory, thus causing a Denial of Service. ([CVE-2005-3858](/security/CVE-2005-3858))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
