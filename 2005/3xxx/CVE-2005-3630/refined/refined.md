Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from the use of an IFRAME in the Fedora Directory Server (FDS) admin console.
- The admin console loads a configuration file containing sensitive information, specifically the admin password, via an IFRAME. This design choice exposes the password to users who are not authorized to view it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the admin password due to insecure handling of the configuration file containing the password within an IFRAME.
- **Insecure Configuration:** The configuration file (`admserv.conf`) with the admin password is accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The vulnerable code allows for unauthorized access to sensitive information by leveraging the IFRAME to load it within the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to the administrative password for the FDS server.
- **Complete Compromise:** With the admin password, an attacker can fully compromise the directory server and perform actions such as data modification, deletion, or privilege escalation.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** This is a direct breach of the confidentiality of the admin credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user who has access to the FDS administration console through the network. 
- **Web Browser:** The vulnerability is exploited by loading the admin console in a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to access the FDS admin console web interface.
- No special privileges or technical skills beyond basic web browsing are required.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided content includes diffs of the fix for the vulnerability.
-   The patch involves changes to the `admserv.conf` and `httpd.conf` files.
-   The fix also includes modifications to explicitly deny access by default in httpd.conf, which are then enabled per directory in admserv.conf
-   The affected software is Fedora Directory Server 1.0.
