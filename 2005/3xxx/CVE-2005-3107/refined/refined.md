Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3107:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `www.ubuntu.com`, `support.avaya.com`, and `www.debian.org` explicitly mentions **CVE-2005-3107**. The descriptions provided align with the vulnerability described in the provided kernel patch from `www.kernel.org`. All content is related to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A race condition exists in the Linux kernel's thread tracing mechanism. Specifically, when a thread is tracing another thread that shares the same memory map, a deadlock can occur during a core dump. This happens when the traced thread is in the `TASK_TRACED` state.

*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The core dump process does not properly handle the case where a traced thread and its tracer share the same memory space. This leads to a circular dependency where the tracer waits for the core dump to finish while the traced thread is blocked in the `TASK_TRACED` state, waiting for the tracer. This creates a deadlock situation.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The deadlock causes the affected threads (and potentially other processes sharing the same memory map) to become unresponsive and unkillable, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **System Hang:** The system may become unresponsive in a more extreme scenario if the deadlock is widespread.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
   * **Local Access:** This vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
    *   The attacker needs to trigger a scenario where a thread is tracing another thread sharing the same memory map. The attacker then needs to force a core dump.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The `www.kernel.org` content provides a patch that addresses the deadlock. The fix involves detecting the scenario where a thread is tracing another thread that shares the same memory, then removing the traced thread from the TASK\_TRACED state when the coredump is triggered.
*   The Ubuntu USN entry describes the vulnerability as "a race condition was found in the handling of traced processes. When one thread was tracing another thread that shared the same memory map, a local attacker could trigger a deadlock (Denial of Service) by forcing a core dump when the traced thread was in the TASK\_TRACED state."
*   The Debian security advisory (DSA 922-1) lists CVE-2005-3107 and describes it as:  "When one thread is tracing another thread that shares the same memory map a local user could cause a denial of service (deadlock) by forcing a core dump when the traced thread is in the TASK_TRACED state."
*   The Avaya advisory also mentions CVE-2005-3107 and describes it as "a flaw in the exec() handling of multi-threaded tasks using ptrace() that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (hang of a user process)".

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content offers details beyond the basic CVE description, including the code fix and specific Linux distributions affected.
*   The fix is specific to the `fs/exec.c` file within the Linux kernel.
*   The Ubuntu security notice provides a list of affected package versions and instructions on how to update.
*   The Debian security advisory lists the specific kernel versions for various architectures.

**In summary,** CVE-2005-3107 involves a race condition in the Linux kernel's thread tracing, which allows a local attacker to trigger a denial of service by causing a deadlock when core dumping.
