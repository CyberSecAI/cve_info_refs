```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The mprotect code on Itanium IA-64 Montecito processors does not properly maintain cache coherency as required by the architecture.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of cache coherency during mprotect system calls on specific Itanium processors.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local users can cause a denial of service (system crash) and potentially corrupt data by modifying PTE (Page Table Entry) protections.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system is required to execute the vulnerable mprotect call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to invoke the `mprotect` system call. The attack is specific to Itanium IA-64 Montecito processors.
