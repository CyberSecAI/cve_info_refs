Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3949:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is insufficient input sanitization within the WebCalendar application. Specifically, multiple SQL injection flaws are present in several PHP files due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in `activity_log.php`, `admin_handler.php`, `edit_template.php`, and `export_handler.php`.
- In `export_handler.php` there is also a local file overwrite vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** Remote attackers could execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially compromising the entire application and database.
- **Local File Overwrite:**  An attacker can overwrite existing data files by manipulating the id and format parameters in `export_handler.php`. This could result in data loss or application malfunction.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests to vulnerable PHP files.
- By injecting malicious SQL code into the parameters passed to the PHP scripts.
- By manipulating the `id` and `format` POST parameters in `export_handler.php` to overwrite arbitrary data files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable WebCalendar application. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required for the identified vulnerabilities.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was identified in WebCalendar version 1.0.1.
- The `getPostValue()` function, used in `export_handler.php`, does not sanitize user input.
- The advisory from ush.it provides specific details on vulnerable files and parameters.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA 1002-1 confirms the CVE and lists the fixed version.
- The vendor fixed some of the issues promptly via CVS.
