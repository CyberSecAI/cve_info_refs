    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
        "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and insecure coding practices in vTiger CRM.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in various input fields and RSS aggregation module.",
            "SQL injection vulnerabilities in login form and other form fields.",
            "Authentication bypass vulnerability when `magic_quotes_gpc` is off.",
            "Information disclosure vulnerability via SQL injection.",
            "Unsafe file inclusion vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of `action` and `module` parameters.",
           "Arbitrary code execution vulnerability by injecting PHP code into log files and including them."
        ],
        "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code, bypass authentication, disclose sensitive information (including passwords), elevate privileges, and perform unauthorized actions.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Manipulating URL parameters to inject malicious scripts.",
            "Socially engineering users to subscribe to malicious RSS feeds.",
            "Using crafted usernames to bypass authentication.",
            "Manipulating form fields to trigger SQL injection.",
            "Manipulating `action` and `module` parameters to include arbitrary files.",
            "Injecting PHP code in various fields and including the log file."
         ],
        "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable vTiger CRM application. Some attacks require a logged in user and some can be performed without login. The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and paths."
    },
      "Additional Information": "This advisory provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It lists numerous specific attack vectors and detailed descriptions of vulnerabilities. It also notes that vendor was informed but no fix was available at the time of disclosure. Recommendations are given to mitigate vulnerabilities."
