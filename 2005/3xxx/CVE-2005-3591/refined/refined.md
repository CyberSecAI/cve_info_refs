  "CVE-2005-3591": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Macromedia Flash Player versions 6 and 7 on Windows platforms are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to an array boundary condition violation when processing SWF files. A crafted SWF file can redirect execution into attacker-controlled memory.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in Flash.ocx, the component responsible for SWF file playback. A function within Flash.ocx maintains a 256-element table of function pointers on the stack. The function uses a frame type identifier read from the SWF file as an index into this array, without validating the array boundaries. This allows an attacker to control the function pointer being called.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Array boundary condition violation",
        "Improper memory access"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the logged-in user.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious SWF file that is opened by a user via the Flash plugin in a web browser, or directly by Flash Player."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver or host a malicious SWF file."
    }
