The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Gadu-Gadu instant messenger, version 7.20 and older, which is relevant to CVE-2005-3891.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Image Sending Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **Vulnerability #1:**  A malicious sender can specify a filename, such as a special device (e.g., 'LPT1:' or 'AUX:'), when sending an image. Sending an image named 'LPT1:' writes the image content to the receiver's LPT1 port. Sending an image named 'AUX:' twice blocks the thread responsible for displaying, receiving, and sending messages on the receiving end.
        *   **Root cause:** Unsanitized filename input when saving images.
        *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation for filenames.
        *   **Impact:** Arbitrary output to device ports, denial of service.
        *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted image with a malicious filename.
        *   **Required capabilities:**  Attacker needs to be able to send images to the victim.

    *   **Vulnerability #2:** A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the image filename handling. If the filename length is between 192 and 200 bytes, a 9-byte buffer overrun occurs when concatenating with `imgcache\`.
        *   **Root cause:** Insufficient bounds checking during filename concatenation.
        *   **Weakness:**  Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability
        *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potentially more (though difficult due to stack protection).
        *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted image with a long filename.
        *   **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to be able to send images to the victim.

2.  **Direct Connection Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **Vulnerability #1:** When using direct connections, if a DCC packet with a code != 2 is sent after a CTCP packet with code 0x01, the next 4 bytes are treated as the content size, and the application allocates memory of this size (if < 0x10000). Sending multiple of these packets can exhaust memory.
        *   **Root cause:** Uncontrolled memory allocation based on attacker-supplied data.
        *   **Weakness:** Memory exhaustion due to lack of proper size validation.
        *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to memory exhaustion.
        *   **Attack vector:** Sending specially crafted DCC packets.
        *  **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to establish direct connection with the victim.

    *   **Vulnerability #2:** DCC packets with codes like 6 or 7 trigger error message pop-ups. Sending many such packets creates multiple threads (one for packet processing, another for the window), leading to a denial of service.
        *   **Root cause:**  Uncontrolled thread creation based on attacker-supplied input.
        *   **Weakness:** Denial of service due to excessive thread creation.
        *   **Impact:** Denial of service through excessive thread creation and window pop-ups.
        *   **Attack vector:** Sending specially crafted DCC packets.
        *   **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to establish direct connection with the victim.

3.  **GG Moniker Vulnerability:**

    *   **Vulnerability #1:** Multiple "gg:" URI handlers on a webpage causes multiple instances of the application to be invoked. Eventually leading to application crash and configuration loss.
        *   **Root cause:** Improper handling of multiple application invocations using the gg: URI handler.
        *   **Weakness:** Lack of resource management/synchronization when handling multiple application invocations
        *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to crashes and potential loss of configuration data.
        *   **Attack vector:** Opening a webpage with multiple "gg:" URI links.
        *   **Required capabilities:** Victim must open the webpage with the crafted links.

4.  **GG Phonecalls Vulnerability:**

    *  **Vulnerability #1:** A webpage can instantiate the `EasycallLite.oce` ActiveXObject and make a call to any number without user consent, allowing eavesdropping if the user has a microphone.
        *   **Root cause:** Unrestricted access to the EasycallLite ActiveXObject.
        *   **Weakness:** Lack of security measures for ActiveX controls
        *   **Impact:** Eavesdropping.
        *   **Attack vector:** Opening a webpage with the crafted code
        *   **Required capabilities:** Victim must open the webpage with the crafted code and have the microphone.
