Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3319:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in how PHP's Apache 2.0 module handles the `session.save_path` configuration option when safe_mode is enabled. Specifically, when an invalid path is set for `session.save_path`, it leads to a crash in the Apache server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of the `session.save_path` configuration within the `sapi_apache2.c` file of the Apache 2.0 SAPI (Server Application Programming Interface) for PHP.
- The `php_checkuid` function in `safe_mode.c` fails when called with a bad or non-existent session path leading to a segmentation fault.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the Apache web server to crash, rendering websites or web applications inaccessible. This is achieved by setting an invalid `session.save_path` in a `.htaccess` file or virtual host configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
- Using a crafted `.htaccess` file: An attacker with the ability to create or modify `.htaccess` files can specify an invalid `session.save_path`.
- Setting the `session.save_path` directive within a VirtualHost configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access: The attacker needs local access or the ability to modify `.htaccess` files or VirtualHost configurations on the server to set the malicious `session.save_path`.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability: The attacker needs to know how to exploit the `session.save_path` vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was resolved by patching the `sapi_apache2.c` file in PHP.
- The bug could be triggered when `safe_mode` was enabled in php.ini.
- The vulnerability was initially discovered in mod\_php but also affects the cgi version of php.
- The issue resulted in a segmentation fault in Apache (SIGSEGV or signal 11) or a trace/breakpoint trap (signal 5), depending on the configuration and debugging setup.
- The vulnerability was present in PHP versions prior to 4.4.1 and 5.1.0
