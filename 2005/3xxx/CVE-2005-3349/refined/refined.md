Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of a temporary lock file used during the music index update process in GNUMP3d. Specifically, the server creates a lock file at `/tmp/index.lok` without checking if it already exists, or if the user has the required permissions for the file operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The server creates the lock file in a shared directory (/tmp) using predictable naming without adequate permission checks.
*  **Symlink Attack:** The server's vulnerability to symlink attacks allows local users to manipulate the location of the lock file operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local attacker can create a symlink at `/tmp/index.lok` pointing to a file that the user running the GNUMP3d server has write permissions to. When the server attempts to create the lock file, it overwrites the target file, leading to potential data loss or system compromise.
*   A local user can also create the lock file before the server, causing the server to not create the lock file and thus prevent the index from updating, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires a local user with the ability to write to the `/tmp` directory.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker must be able to create symlinks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to the system where the GNUMP3d server is running.
*   The attacker must have the ability to create files and symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
*   The attacker does not need any specific privileges other than being a local user.

**Additional details:**

* This vulnerability was fixed by removing the lockfile code altogether in version 2.9.8
* The vulnerability allows a local user to create or delete any file the server user has permission to modify
* The issue was identified by Ludwig Nussel from SUSE Linux.
