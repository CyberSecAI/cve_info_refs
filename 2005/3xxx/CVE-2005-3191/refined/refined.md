  "CVE-2005-3191": {
    "description": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the (1) DCTStream::readProgressiveSOF and (2) DCTStream::readBaselineSOF functions in the DCT stream parsing code (Stream.cc) in xpdf 3.01 and earlier, as used in products such as (a) Poppler, (b) teTeX, (c) KDE kpdf, (d) pdftohtml, (e) KOffice KWord, (f) CUPS, and (g) libextractor allow user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (heap corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file with an out-of-range number of components (numComps), which is used as an array index.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in multiple functions within the Xpdf library, specifically within the DCT stream parsing code. These integer overflows can lead to heap-based buffer overflows when handling malformed PDF files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
         "Integer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (heap corruption) and potentially execute arbitrary code by enticing a user to open a crafted PDF file.",
      "attack_vectors": "The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file. This could be delivered through various means such as email attachments, web pages, or other file sharing mechanisms.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice the user to open a crafted PDF file with a vulnerable application. No further special privileges are required."
