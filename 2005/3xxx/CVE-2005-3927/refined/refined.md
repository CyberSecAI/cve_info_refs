  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2005-3927",
      "root_cause": "The server variable `$REMOTE_ADDR` is not properly sanitized before being stored in an include file (.inc). This allows for the injection of arbitrary PHP code through a crafted HTTP request.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Arbitrary code injection",
        "Local file inclusion",
        "Remote file inclusion"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, and denial of service. It also allows arbitrary local file inclusion which can expose sensitive user data such as password hashes.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP request parameter manipulation",
        "Remote exploitation"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `error.php` script. This can be achieved remotely without any authentication."
