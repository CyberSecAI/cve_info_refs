Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from flaws in the file type detection routines of multiple anti-virus scanning engines. These engines incorrectly rely on "magic bytes" (file headers) to identify file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incorrect File Type Detection:**  The vulnerability arises when the anti-virus software uses the file's magic bytes (specifically the "MZ" header associated with executable files) instead of file extension for file type identification. 
*   **Header Forgery:** By prepending the "MZ" header of an executable file to other file types (like .BAT, .HTML, and .EML), the anti-virus software is tricked into misinterpreting the file type. 
*   **Bypass of Scanning:** This misidentification leads the AV software to bypass its normal scanning procedures because the file is not identified as malicious.
*   **Exploitable File Types:** The vulnerability is specifically tested and confirmed with .BAT, .HTML, and .EML files. The nature of these file types allows them to execute even with prepended data, facilitating the exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Detection Evasion:** Malicious files can evade detection by anti-virus software, allowing them to execute and infect systems.
*   **Malware Propagation:**  Existing and new viruses can spread undetected, increasing the risk of infection.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to malware execution, potentially resulting in system compromise, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File Attachment:** An attacker could send a malicious file disguised as a .BAT, .HTML, or .EML file with a prepended executable header (MZ) via email or other means.
*   **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker could host a malicious file on a website that, when downloaded, bypasses anti-virus scans due to the header manipulation.
*   **Local File System:** An attacker with access to the local file system could modify existing malicious files in place and inject a malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Modify Files:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the contents of a file, specifically prepending a forged magic byte (e.g., MZ header).
*   **Distribution Method:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the crafted file to the target machine, like email, a malicious website or physical media
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable AV:** The attacker needs to know what anti-virus software is being used and that it is vulnerable to this exploit, although this can be easily tested.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is described as "critical" due to the high potential impact.
*   A "triple headed" program was created to demonstrate the ability to execute different code depending on the file extension, further highlighting the exploitation of different file type handlers.
*   The issue is not that the change of a virus file broke the detection signature but rather the fact that the file is being incorrectly identified as an executable based on the crafted header, and thus is not scanned correctly.
*   A long list of vulnerable AV solutions has been compiled as part of the exploit research, including popular vendors such as McAfee, TrendMicro, Kaspersky, AVG, and others.
