{
  "CVE-2005-3488": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Scorched 3D allow a remote attacker to deny service or execute arbitrary code on game servers.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "weakness": "Format string vulnerability and buffer overflows in `GLConsole::addLine`, `ServerCommon::sendString*`, and `ServerCommon::serverLog` functions.",
        "root_cause": "The functions use `vsprintf` with static buffers of varying sizes, and user-provided input is directly passed as format arguments.",
          "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service by exploiting the format string vulnerability or buffer overflows.",
           "attack_vector": "The vulnerabilities are triggered by sending specially crafted messages, commands, or values to the game server, which then uses them in vulnerable `vsprintf` calls."
       },
      {
        "weakness": "Server freeze due to negative `numplayers` value.",
        "root_cause": "The server uses a user-provided `numplayers` value to create a specific number of players. A negative value bypasses a signed check and causes an infinite loop in `ServerConnectHandler.cpp`",
        "impact": "Remote attacker can cause a denial of service by freezing the game server.",
        "attack_vector": "The attacker connects to the server and sends a message with a negative value for `numplayers`. If the server requires a password, the attacker must know it."
      },
      {
        "weakness": "Buffer overflow in `ComsMessageHandler.cpp`",
        "root_cause": "Error messages are created using `sprintf` into a fixed-size buffer when handling message type errors.",
        "impact": "Remote attacker can cause a denial of service, possibly code execution.",
        "attack_vector": "The attacker sends a command with a message type string that is longer than the buffer, overflowing it."
      },
        {
        "weakness": "Crashes and possible remote code execution in `Logger.cpp`",
        "root_cause": "The server crashes when processing long values like a large `UniqueID` in Logger.cpp. Some exploitation methods may require the server password.",
        "impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.",
           "attack_vector": "The attacker provides a long value, such as a large UniqueID, causing a crash. Further exploitation for remote code execution is possible."
      }
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Remote attacker capable of sending crafted messages to the game server. Some attacks may require knowledge of the server password.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerabilities are present in Scorched 3D version 39.1 and earlier, affecting servers on Windows, Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, and Solaris."
