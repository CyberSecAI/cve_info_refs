The provided content relates to CVE-2005-3209.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper validation of user-supplied input, leading to SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and insecure password storage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** Multiple scripts fail to properly sanitize user input, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands through parameters like 'password' in `/password/default.asp` or `/user/control.asp` and 'strSQL' in `/search.asp` or `/incs/searchdisplay.asp`.
2.  **Clear Text Password Storage:** Passwords are stored in clear text in 'control', 'content', and 'pages' tables, violating confidentiality.
3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Various active server pages render user-supplied input without proper sanitization, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** An attacker can use SQL injection to bypass login and gain unauthorized access with low-level privileges. They can also extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the database.
2.  **Clear Text Password Storage:** Exposes user credentials, allowing attackers to directly use them for unauthorized access if they manage to access the database.
3.  **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML scripts to manipulate content, redirect users, or steal cookies.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through HTTP GET/POST requests via the mentioned vulnerable parameters.
2.  **XSS:** Attackers inject malicious scripts via user-supplied input fields or parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and provide crafted payloads. The attacker does not need to be authenticated for some of the vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection in /search.asp).
