Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in phpMyFAQ 1.5.1:

**1) SQL Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `password.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `username` and `email` parameters within the SQL queries. This occurs when `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled in the PHP configuration.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of input sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code through the username and email fields.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can reset any user's password (including the admin password) and gain complete control of the application. The attacker can manipulate data in the database, and potentially gain access to the underlying system through PHP code injection.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By submitting malicious input to the "forgotten password" feature.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to access the application's login page and the "forgotten password" feature and should be able to send HTTP requests. The attacker does not need an existing account.

**2) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled data that is reflected in the page.
*   **Weakness:** The `footer.php` and `header.php` scripts allow for injecting JavaScript through the `PMF_CONF[version]` and `PMF_LANG[metaLanguage]` parameters respectively.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that can be executed in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By sending crafted GET requests to the vulnerable scripts with the malicious javascript payloads.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.

**3) Arbitrary File Inclusion (Local File Inclusion - LFI) on Windows:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to arbitrary file inclusion due to a lack of proper input sanitization and usage of the `LANGCODE` parameter in `index.php`. The vulnerability is triggered by the inclusion of null bytes `%00`. This is specifically mentioned to be working on Windows servers.
*   **Weakness:** The application does not properly validate user-supplied file paths, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read any file on the server, including sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd` or other configuration files.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By crafting a URL that includes the path to the desired file in the `LANGCODE` parameter, appending a null byte.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.

**4) Arbitrary PHP File Inclusion:**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to the LFI vulnerability, the `index.php` allows inclusion of any PHP file, without the extension, via `LANGCODE` parameter.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation in the `LANGCODE` parameter, enabling the inclusion of arbitrary files.
*    **Impact:** If an attacker can place a malicious PHP script on the server (e.g., using another vulnerability), this vulnerability allows them to execute it, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted GET request to `index.php` that includes the path to the malicious script in `LANGCODE`.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application, and has to have uploaded or have access to a php file on the target server.

**5) User Info Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application stores user tracking information in log files that are publicly accessible.
*   **Weakness:** The log files under `data/tracking` are not protected and are accessible without authentication.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can view user tracking information, potentially including sensitive data.
*  **Attack Vector:** Accessing the `data/tracking[date]` log files by crafting URLs.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.

**6) Path Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:** When an invalid file is passed in `LANGCODE` parameter, the application exposes the path in the error message.
*   **Weakness:** The application reveals the full path to the script when an invalid file path is passed through the `LANGCODE` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gather information about the server's file system structure.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted GET request to `index.php` that includes the path to a non-existent file in `LANGCODE`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.

**7) Remote Command Execution (RCE) Through Log Injection & Inclusion:**

*  **Root Cause:**  By injecting php code in the `User-Agent` header, this code is saved to the tracking log file. An LFI vulnerability on `index.php` is then used to include the log file and execute the injected php code.
*   **Weakness:** The application logs the `User-Agent` header without sanitization and fails to prevent file inclusion using a null byte, specifically on Windows systems where the null byte truncation is an issue.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can achieve remote command execution by injecting PHP code and then including the log file, resulting in complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a `User-Agent` header containing PHP code, and using the LFI vulnerability to execute the code injected to the log files.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application. `magic_quotes_gpc` must be off.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit script `phpmyfaq_xpl.php` automates the process of exploiting the log injection, LFI and RCE vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory mentions that some of the issues are contingent on the `magic_quotes_gpc` setting in PHP.
*   The advisory mentions this was tested against Windows servers, and is noted to be a "divertissement", but then clarifies that "we are admin, remember?".
*   The exploit uses null byte injection, which was a common technique in older versions of PHP when combined with file inclusion flaws.
