- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CuteNews application, specifically in `index.php`, does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing file paths for archive retrieval. It uses a user-controlled `archive` parameter, allowing path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Path Traversal: The application allows the user to traverse the file system by manipulating the `archive` parameter.
    - Path Disclosure: The application's error messages reveal the full installation path of the software, including the absolute path on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can discover the server's file system structure, potentially leading to the discovery of sensitive information, configuration files, or other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious `archive` parameter.
    - The vulnerability is triggered by requesting `index.php` with the crafted URL, leading to an error message displaying the full file path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected CuteNews installation.
    - No authentication is required; this is a pre-authentication vulnerability.
