 -=====================================================================-

  Analysis
 __________

 Specially crafted archive containing a virus will pass
 through the antivirus system without detection.

 An attacker can compress a malicious payload and evade
 detection by some anti-virus software.

 The bypassed malicious content does not pose a risk until
 extracted from the RAR archive file. Malicious content
 will be detected and eliminated by your Antivirus.

 Contrary to Winzip or BitZipper which do not authorize the
 opening of the file, Winrar & PowerZip open & extract it.
