Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2005-3665:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `HTTP_HOST` variable and certain header-generation scripts within the phpMyAdmin libraries directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. This occurs because user-controlled data from the `HTTP_HOST` variable and through header generation scripts is used in the application's output without sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious script.
*   The `HTTP_HOST` variable is under total control of the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web script or HTML.
*   **Cookie Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal cookie-based authentication credentials. This could then lead to unauthorized access to phpMyAdmin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP requests. The attacker manipulates the `HTTP_HOST` header, or crafts requests that trigger vulnerable scripts in the libraries directory.
*   **Remote:** The attacker does not require local access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the phpMyAdmin server.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions prior to 2.7.0
*   The issue is also identified as PMASA-2005-8.
*   The issue is present both in the HTTP_HOST variable and some scripts in the libraries directory that handle header generation
*   The fix is to upgrade to phpMyAdmin version 2.7.0.
*   The vulnerability is considered serious.
*   The vulnerability is also present in Debian and fixed in version 2.6.2-3sarge2 for the stable distribution (sarge) and version 2.9.0.3-1 for the upcoming stable release (etch) and unstable distribution (sid)
