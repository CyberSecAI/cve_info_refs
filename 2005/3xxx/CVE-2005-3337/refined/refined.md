Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2005-3337:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The content states that Mantis is affected by several vulnerabilities including cross-site scripting (XSS). The root cause of these XSS vulnerabilities is the improper sanitization and handling of user-supplied input by the application which leads to injection of malicious client-side code.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Multiple Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:** The application is vulnerable to multiple XSS issues.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**
   - **XSS:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious script code in the victim's browser. This can lead to stealing cookie-based authentication credentials, which could compromise the user's session. Attackers can also redirect users to phishing sites, steal user data, or deface the web page.

**4. Attack vectors:**
   - **XSS:** The attacker injects malicious scripts into the Mantis application, typically by providing crafted inputs to vulnerable web page parameters or forms. When a victim views the page, the malicious script gets executed in their browser.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **XSS:** An attacker needs to be able to submit or inject malicious scripts into input parameters, such as text fields, forms, or other data points processed by Mantis. The attacker's position is typically remote, and no special privileges are required if the application doesn't properly sanitize input.
