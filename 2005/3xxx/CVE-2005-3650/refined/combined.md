## First4Internet CodeSupport ActiveX controls incorrectly marked 'safe for scripting'

#### Vulnerability Note VU#312073

Original Release Date: 2005-11-16 | Last Revised: 2005-12-07

---

### Overview

An ActiveX control used to uninstall XCP Digital Rights Management (DRM) software made by First 4 Internet and distributed on some Sony BMG audio CDs is marked "Safe for scripting"

### Description

| XCP Digital Rights Management (DRM) software by First 4 Internet, which is distributed by some Sony BMG audio CDs. The XCP copy protection software uses "rootkit" technology to hide certain files from the user. A problem has been reported in an ActiveX control used to uninstall this software.  It has been reported that upon submitting a request to uninstall the DRM software, the user will receive via email a link to a Sony BMG web page. This page will attempt to install an ActiveX control when it is displayed in Internet Explorer. This ActiveX control is marked "Safe for scripting," which means that any web page may be able to utilize the control and its methods. Some of the methods provided by this control appear to present security problems, as they may allow an attacker to download and execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| It has been reported the ActiveX control used to uninstall XCP DRM software may allow remote attackers to download and execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. The ActiveX control will only execute code that is packaged in a certain file format. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Set the kill-bit for CLSID {4EA7C4C5-C5C0-4F5C-A008-8293505F71CC} after uninstalling the XCP DRM software. |
| --- |

| As an alternative, disable ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer after uninstalling the XCP DRM software. Removing the vulnerable control may also limit the potential risk reported for the CodeSupport control:cmd /k del “%windir%\downloaded program files\codesupport.ocx” |

# Sony's Web-Based Uninstaller Opens a Big Security Hole; Sony to Recall Discs

November 15, 2005 by [Ed Felten](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/author/felten/)

[This post was co-written by [J. Alex Halderman](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jhalderm) and [Ed Felten](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten).]

Over the weekend a Finnish researcher named Muzzy [noticed](http://hack.fi/~muzzy/sony-drm/) a potential vulnerability in the web-based uninstaller that Sony offers to users who want to remove the First4Internet XCP copy protection software. We took a detailed look at the software and discovered that it is indeed possible for an attacker to exploit this weakness. For affected users, this represents a far greater security risk than even the original Sony rootkit.

The consequences of the flaw are severe. It allows any web page you visit to download, install, and run any code it likes on your computer. Any web page can seize control of your computer; then it can do anything it likes. That’s about as serious as a security flaw can get.

The root of the problem is a serious design flaw in Sony’s web-based uninstaller. When you first fill out [Sony’s form](http://cp.sonybmg.com/xcp/english/form9.html) to request a copy of the uninstaller, the request form downloads and installs a program – an ActiveX control created by the DRM vendor, First4Internet – called CodeSupport. CodeSupport remains on your system after you leave Sony’s site, and it is marked as safe for scripting, so any web page can ask CodeSupport to do things. One thing CodeSupport can be told to do is download and install code from an Internet site. Unfortunately, CodeSupport doesn’t verify that the downloaded code actually came from Sony or First4Internet. This means any web page can make CodeSupport download and install code from any URL without asking the user’s permission.

A malicious web site author can write an evil program, package up that program appropriately, put the packaged code at some URL, and then write a web page that causes CodeSupport to download and run code from that URL. If you visit that web page with Internet Explorer, and you have previously requested Sony’s uninstaller, then the evil program will be downloaded, installed, and run on your computer, immediately and automatically. Your goose will be cooked.

We have constructed a demonstration code package and web page that exploits this design flaw to install unwanted files on a target computer. The exploit does not actually harm the computer, but it demonstrates that hostile code can be run on a target computer, and that the hostile code can perform operations that should be forbidden. At present we are not releasing the demonstration exploit to the public.

CodeSupport was also installed as part of the original web-based updater that Sony released to remove First4Internet’s rootkit. Sony has since replaced the web-based version of the updater with a downloadable EXE or ZIP file; these are safe to use as far as we know. If you didn’t use the original web-based updater, and you haven’t requested the full uninstaller from Sony, then you are safe from this particular vulnerability, as far as we know.

How can you protect yourself against this vulnerability? First, for now don’t accept the installation of any software delivered over the net from First4Internet. (Eventually First4Internet may deliver a fix over the net. That may be worth installing.) That will keep CodeSupport off you machine, if it’s not already there.

To see whether CodeSupport is on your computer, try our [CodeSupport detector page](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jhalderm/xcp/detect.html).

If you’re vulnerable, you can protect yourself by deleting the CodeSupport component from your machine. From the Start menu, choose Run. In the box that pops up, type (on a single line)

cmd /k del “%windir%downloaded program filescodesupport.\*”

This is not an ideal solution – depending on your security settings, it may not prevent the software from installing again – but it’s better than nothing. We’ll have to wait for First4Internet to develop a complete patch.

UPDATE: USA Today [reports](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/computersecurity/2005-11-14-sony-cds_x.htm?csp=34) that Sony will recall the affected CDs. Discs in the supply chain will not be sold, and customers who have already bought discs will be able to exchange them. Sony will announce details of the recall plan later in the week. We hope the plan will include distribution of cleanup tools to customers who still have potentially dangerous XCP software on their machines.

   Every new product will have problems it just needs to be tested and tested, and tested and debuged and tested , so help them by letting them know the problems, maybe then it will be fixed properly.

   Surely anyone wanting to make illegal copies of XCP-protected CDs can simply do so using a different operating system, eg. Linux?

   So XCP inconveniences legitimate users, but does nothing to stop those determined to make copies….

    […] By Charlie Demerjian: Tuesday 15 November 2005, 20:45 SONY PULLS OFF ANOTHER blatant stupidity in the ‘cure is worse than the disease’ category. No, not the DRM infection itself, not the security compromising removal agreement, but the removal tool itself. Yes, this one appears to put you in MORE danger than the original rootkit. Silly Sony, no cookie. According to Freedon To Tinker, the web based installer is a worse vulnerability than the original rootkit. More on the story here, FTT goes into detail. It seems the ‘cure’ from Sony involves downloading an ActiveX control called CodeSupport. This is a signed control that lets just about anyone download, install and execute arbitrary code on your machine. See a problem? See a big problem? To make matters even funnier, the uninstaller, supposedly anyway, leaves this control on your machine. So, the Sony uninstaller is not a total uninstaller, it leaves a hole you can drive a truck through on your system, silently of course. The more disturbing part is that it appears the control is signed. I wonder who at MS approved this, and how this blatant security hole got through the barest minimum of QC? Moral, if you bought Sony products, you are screwed. If it causes you problems, you are screwed more. If you uninstall, you are screwed yet harder. If you uninstall it yourself, you are a criminal under the DMCA. If you use an antivirus program to uninstall it, you spent money to fix Sony’s problems, and you are still a criminal. That’s what you get for buying music.Âµ   Home     Discuss on our Forum     Flame Author Recommend this article      Print     […]

    […] This drama is also about incompetence. Sony’s latest rootkit-removal tool actually leaves a gaping vulnerability. And Sony’s rootkit — designed to stop copyright infringement — itself may have infringed on copyright. As amazing as it might seem, the code seems to include an open-source MP3 encoder in violation of that library’s license agreement. But even that is not the real story. […]

    well, i had to take the computer in to be fixed. it seems that that program cloaked more that it should. had to end up having the drive wiped and the os re-installed to the tune of $200.00. yeah,sony way to go. and just think 2.1 million of these cds are out there waiting to do harm. i hope sonybmg goes broke because of this and other companies take the notice…

    MOVIES NOT MUSIC CD’S:

    Ok, you have done a good job on music, but you have not gone far enough.

    Now visit your local Blockbusters, rent a few CDs and observe that “movie playing software” that gets installed or attempts to install. I will bet you will uncover all the big entertainment companies are loading software similiar to Sony BMG’s rootkit. The software scandal is bigger than discovered, so far.

    Yeah, I have bought a Xbox 360 Glenn, and it’s okay, but from a technical standpoint. Sony Playstation III is gonna blow 360 out of the water, no offense if you’re a Xbox or Microsoft Lover, but I do agree that the first xbox was better than playstation 2, but this is not gonna be the case the second time around. By the way. Just thought I’d tell you that the Sony and SonyBMG are the same company, but two entirely different branches, and if they were any more far apart then they wouldn’t even be the same company. BMG is a music company, and Sony is a electronic products maker. So, thinking that SonyBMG’s treturous acts is gonna be included with anything done with Sony is wrong. Sony in it’s entirety is not the one to blame, but SonyBMG, but I do think alot of compliants need to made about this. If you signed a agreement at the beginning saying that it’s okay for this rootkit to be there, but for them to just install it, without permission is going way too far. I don’t even think this should be an issue personally. If I buy the cd, I should be able to do what the heck I want to do with it. If I want to burn a copy, it’s my priotrity because I paid the 13-20bucks for it, and it’s my property.

    I have done a advanced search on my computer for all files associated with First4Internet, and $sys$upgtool.exe did come up, it is the only file I missed apparently. However, since you’ve already deleted all the files it uses to run, it’s not a threat anyways, but yeah, it’s not supposed to be there. Go, ahead and delete it, and you should be tottally clean of the rootkit. Keep in mind, that SP2 is a rootkit too, so if you see files with example: $NTUninstall$ don’t be alarmed, because it’s XP Files, but however if you ever catch a glimspe of a file that has $ anywhere in it’s name, and it’s not distributed by Microsoft. It’s always a good idea, to go ahead and check by doing a spyware check. Anyways, I’m glad my instructions worked for you. Just don’t EVER put another SonyBMG in your computer that say it’s protected by Rogue software, and you should be fine.

    Randal – You rock! Your instructions worked perfectly!!

    THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!

    One more quick question if you don’t mind…should $sys$upgtool.exe be deleted out of System32 folder? It seemed to be named similar to the other files…

    Again, thanks for the instructions. I’m now successfully listening to a non-sony/bmg/columbia CD on my computer!

    Hey, sorry, I left out some information in the earlier post, but yes, you do delete $sys$crater and $sys$cor from

    HKEY\_Local\_MachineSYSTEMCurrentControlSetServices. Those files you could not find, were either removed by Microsoft AntiSpyware or where installed when I downloaded the uncloaking the device, and if you did not, then this explains while they were there for me, and not for you. You have gotten rid of this rootkit though, the evidence is shown with you not having your cd-rom drives show. Download the Pstools from this website, unzip it, then take all the contents (do not put it in a folder), and move it to C:WindowsSystem32 to install it, you will be asked if you want to replace this dll file with the other one say yes or yes to all. Then, go to run, type in psexec -s -i -d regedit.exe then click run, this will open regedit, but in a different way so that you can delete what is necessary. Go to HKEY\_Local\_MachineSYSTEMCurrentControlSetEnumIDE. Underneath this you will find your cd-rom drive(s) click on the name of your cd drive, and then click the number underneath a list of different keys will pop up, find the one that says lowerfilters and beside it saying either $sys$crater, or $sys$crater imapi. Then after deleting those two go to HKEY\_Local\_MachineSYSTEMCurrentControlSetEnumPCIIDEIDE Channel. There will be two sequences of numbers under these the first is primary, and the one under that is secondary. Since your cd rom is hooked up to secondary then, you will want to click the second one. Then look for the key that contains $sys$cor, delete this key. Close Registry Editor, and restart your computer, your cd drives should be back up.

    Well I d/led the microsoft spyware and finally picked up on the $sys$DRMserver.exe. I deleted all the HKEY\_Local\_Machine and found a couple of others under SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services:

    $sys$cor

    $sys$crater

    I found all you stated for the System32 but XPCPlugins.dll, XCPPhoneix.dll and ClientSyncLoader. I think perhaps the spyware picked up on it. However I also found $nCSp$.inf, $winnt$.inf and $sys$upgtool.exe

    I don’t know if I should delete these or not. I rebooted and the $sys$DRMserver.exe is now completely gone.

    However, now my DVD and CD drives are missing. I don’t know what to do about that.

    I posted here in case anyone else has any suggestions, because I don’t know how to get my drives back. Do I need to download drivers again or something?!?!

    This is a good site: <http://blogs.technet.com/antimalware/>

    I’ve scanned my computer about 5 times tonight with various registry, virus, spyware, etc. So I hope that it’s off…but now I just need to figure out how to get my CD drives back.

    Hey tired of this crap. Yeah, that’s how I was feeling about this time too. It may be that you can’t find some of this stuff that I had posted if you have ran a spyware or viruscan (one that searches for more than just viruses.) Upon doing this your scanner may have picked up on some things, and removed what it could find, and then left some still on there. I’m not sure how big of a threat it actually is if $sys$DRMServer.exe is not running, but however it is most important that you delete the folder $sys$filesystem in the directory C:WindowsSystem32. If this is not found there I would say that you don’t have the rootkit still on there, and that it’s something else causing this problem. Try using Microsoft Antispyware, this will pick up on the rootkit if still there. Antispyware is unsucessful in removing it, but you will find it, then if not there, then try rootkitrevealer, if you’re not picking up anything anywhere then you no longer have Sony’s rootkit on there, and it must be something else causing this. This is just a recommendation, and I’m not saying that it’s not still on there, because I’ve been to alot of places where people say it’s not there, but it is. If you have any further questions visit my website. There is some contact information there. Email me, and I’ll try to help you the best I can. As for anyone else that needs help with this or any other problem.

    i tried the code support detector page and it’s detected on my computer, but i tried following the instructions that randall nicely posted but am not having any luck.i don’t have the $sys$DRMserver.exe running under the processes tab. and all the HKEY files are not there i found one under HKEY software for Sony BMG with the following files Default, InstallRevisionHi, and InstallRevisionLo. I don’t know what to do, I just want get it off my computer (if it’s still there?) my system IS running slower and I fear a virus of some sort…I did send in for an uninstall request and I think I might have installed the DirectX….

    If anyone can offer advice I’m all ears.

    Everyone is talking about the subject, but no one is saying how to get rid of it. Well, here’s your answer.

    How to manually remove SonyBMG’s Rootkit from your XP machine.

    First unplug your source of internet. Then hit ctrl+alt+del, and click the process tab. Find $sys$DRMserver.exe and end this proccess.

    Go to start, then run, type in “regedit” and then enter.

    Delete these keys:

    HKEY\_Local\_MachineSYSTEMCurrentControlSetServices$sys$DRM

    HKEY\_Local\_MachineSOFTWARE$sys$References

    HKEY\_Local\_MachineSONYBMG

    Then after that delete these files.

    C:WindowsSystem32$sys$caj.dll

    C:WindowsSystem32AXPSupport.dll

    C:WindowsSystem32InstallContinue.exe

    C:WindowsSystem32XPCPlugins.dll

    C:WindowsSystem32ECDPlayerControl.ocx

    C:WindowsSystem32XCPPhoenix.dll

    C:WindowsSystem32ClientSyncLoader.htm\*\*\*\*or possibly html.

    After that delete these two folders, and all of their contents.

    C:WindowsSystem32SoftwareDistribution

    C:WindowsSystem32$sys$filesystem

    After doing all these steps, shutdown your computer. While the computer is shutdown, replug your source of internet back up to your computer. This is how we tell if your copy of the rootkit was succesfully removed. The process $sys$DRMserver.exe is activated by a source of connectivity to the internet. If it doesn’t start up at Windows XP’s Login then your computer is free from Sony’s harmful attempt to cut back on distribution of music, but my opinion is my cd, my priorty to do whatever I want with it. Hope that this helped. Just remember, if it says copy-protection software on the case, it would be a good idea not to insert into computer’s disk drive unless you check to make sure that the label of that cd does not belong to SONY BMG. PeAcE

    P.S. After this, and any deletion of registry keys I recommend that you use a registry cleaner, for those of you that don’t have one here’s a free program that will take care of everything. However, I recommend that you do the registry scan more than once because it doesn’t get all in it’s first pass, but no worries this only take about 45seconds on a 600mhz proccessor, so if yours is faster then you really don’t have to worry about it.

    To totally remove the First4Internet CodeSupport insecure ActiveX control, do the following at a command prompt:

    regsvr32 %windir%downlo~1codesupport.ocx /u

    del %windir%”Downloaded Program files”codesupport.\*

    If you omit the first command, you’re left with a broken control listed in your downloaded program files. And I hate it when there’s garbage from an uninstaller left on my machine. 😉

    Go to internet options, general tab, temporary internet files, settings button, see objects. Look for it and right click to remove.

    Notes:

    I’m on a not English version of windows, so guessing some names.

    Browsing with Firefox is safe because FF is not based in ActiveX technology.

    Removing the ActiveX obviously doesn’t remove any virusware that might have hit your system.

    You have an alternate uninstaller for the rootkit at Sophos:

    has anyone found out where this company “First4Internet” is from? who the people are? Everything they’ve done looks so ridiculously fishy–both the initial DRM and the CodeSupport–that it doens’t seem farfetched at all that they either are in cahoots with hackers or are themselves a hacking group. Sheesh, how about that for a story? They develope malicious code and disseminate not through emails, how passÃ©, but through CDs porduced by a megacorporation that people have to PAY FOR.

    Who says Sony/First4Internet didn’t see this? Can you think of a better “punishment” (in their eyes) for those ungrateful people who want to remove the rootkit on their system?

    And it IS a root kit. It bypasses and redirects kernel functions and low level OS and hardware access. The activeX app is not a rootkit but it does leave you extremely vulnerable to having another one installed on your system (perhaps even by the Sony/First4Internet sites before you leave).

    I’ve been saying all along that it’s a mistake to call the software implementing the Sony DRM a “rootkit”. It’s cloaking software. That may be a component of your typical rootkit, and a component that isn’t found in anything but rootkits, but it’s not a rootkit.

    The web uninstaller is much more of a rootkit. Unfortunately, having abused the term “rootkit”, people are going to sound like the little boy who cried “wolf” on this one.

    I almost installed Sony’s active-X uninstaller until I saw that it was written by First4Internet, the same people that wrote the original rootkit. I said, “you have to be kidding!”. There was no way that I was going to let the same company that put a rootkit on my computer also install an active-X program. I dodged that bullet with a little common sense. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me! And of course, shame on you Sony for doing this in the first place. I’m waiting to remove the rootkit until I’m convinced that the removal code is finally written well and correctly, and that it has been verified.

    I’m just beyond frustrated!!! I bought stupid Neil Diamond’s new cd and now i’ve got to deal with this. I’ve trusted everything that Sony/BMG has told me to what end? I downloaded the patch and I’ve used the uninstall form. Sheesh.

    So now I’ve tried deleting the codesupport components and I keep getting access denied. So yeah….any help would be appreciated.

    I primarily use Firefox not IE. Does this offer any protection or am I pretty much screwed until something reliable comes out to remove this vulnerability?

    I havn’t seen it covered much in this blog entry or in the comments, but the fact that First4Internet’s/Sony’s web uninstaller is even more nefarious than the original rootkit.

    By going through the uninstall process, you are supposed to feel more protected as you just got rid of nasty malware. Well you are now open to all sorts of new exploits, and you are supposed to think you are protected again.

    I have one question about this mess. Sony is both a content company and a consumer electronics company. In particular, they make CD & DVD drives for personal computers, for instance:

    <http://cnet.search.com/search?chkpt=astg.cnet.fd.search.cnet&q=sony+internal+CD+drives&tag=srch>

    Is it possible that the bundled drivers for these products could include similar rootkit/spyware/use restriction technology? Has anybody in the press even ASKED Sony whether they do? Or what about their Vaio product line – could these it the same junk pre-installed at the factory?

    I have a Sony CD-RW drive that I bought in 2000, but I’d be very reluctant to purchase any new computer hardware or software from them — or even install a product patch or update — unless Sony clearly promises not to sneak any DRM-related restrictionware into their products.

     Well, my reboot demo is as dangerous as the uninstall request link that’s also in the article. It, too, will prompt to install the ActiveX control. I just copypasted the html from there so it’s identical. A safer demonstration would make sense, though, rebooting the system isn’t really a nice thing 🙂

# Muzzy's research about Sony's XCP DRM system

I've collected some of my findings about the Sony's XCP DRM rootkit
here. Enjoy! I've been rewriting the page as new information has been
uncovered, although currently the updates are rare.

I've also written a short [summary
about the XCP DRM system](info.html) and [my opinions](rant-and-whine.html) as separate pages. This page tries to
stick to the facts, so if you think there's something biased or
wrong here, please mail me

## Latest updates

* [Sony BMG released standalone uninstaller](http://cp.sonybmg.com/xcp/english/updates.html) which seems to work. I
  uninstalled while keeping my Van Zant in the cd drive, and after reboot
  I was able to succesfully extract the audio data without DRM noise.
* Alex Halderman found that XCP appears to **intentionally**
  contain code to bypass Apple's DRM scheme, including [code
  to add Apple's DRM](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=940) into any audio file.
* Ben Edelman found out that [Sony BMG could
  easily inform affected customers](http://www.benedelman.org/news/112105-1.html) about the exchange program but
  doesn't currently do so.
* GPL code found in ECDPlayerControl.ocx, DMCA/EUCD violation too?
  Scroll down to the bottom of the page for details
* With some help from [Sabre Security](http://www.sabre-security.com/),
  Sebastian Porst identified
  [mpglib in ECDPlayerControl.ocx](http://www.the-interweb.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/54-Breakthrough-after-breakthrough-in-the-F4I-case.html)
* [More copyright infringement cases in the same file](http://www.the-interweb.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/56-Two-new-F4I-license-infringements-found.html)
* Sam Hocevar (co-author of GPL'd DRMS code) confirms that the
  implementation used in XCP indeed
  [originates from his GPL'd code](http://sam.zoy.org/blog/2005-11-21-suspicious-activity-indeed).

## The Old Uninstaller

The uninstaller required you to install an ActiveX control to
your system before you could even request for an uninstall url.
Turns out, the uninstaller activex marks itself safe for scripting,
and has plenty of interesting methods available for everyone to use.
Although I have not analyzed them in depth, I have tested one of
them to confirm it really does what I think it does. It's called
"RebootMachine". If you have installed Sony's ActiveX control,
follow the link to [invoke the RebootMachine
method](reboot.html). I don't even want to know what the ExecuteCode method
does...

The InstallUpdate method has a bigger security hole, see
[freedom-to-tinker.com's post about the uninstaller hole](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=927).
They refer that trying my reboot demo to test if you're vulnerable
might make things worse, this is because I copypasted the html
from F4I's site so it used to prompt to install the ActiveX control.
I have since changed it, since F4I could change their interfaces
anytime anyway, it doesn't serve any purpose to provide the install
ability in the demo.

### Scriptable methods left behind

The uninstaller leaves behind lots of methods, here are the
names:

* GenerateRequestPacket
* ExecuteCode (can crash browser, apparently removed in latest ocx)
* Uninstall
* RebootMachine (exploitable, see demo)
* GetProgress
* OnLoaded
* InitializeDiscScan
* GetNumberOfDiscs
* IsDRMServerValid
* GetAlbumArtist
* GetAlbumName
* GetMaxBurnCount
* GetCurrentBurnCount
* GenerateIncrementPacket
* IsContentOwnerValid
* DoIncrement
* GetInstalledSoftwareVersion
* IsXCPDiscPresent
* InstallUpdate (exploitable)
* GetInstallProgress
* GetCompletionStatus
* IsXCPDiscPresentAsLong
* IsAdministrator

Considering anyone can reboot the computer using these,
I suspect security wasn't thought about for even a second during
development of this thing. Virus writers and such would be very
interested in analyzing what these methods do, as some of them
are remotely exploitable... by design.

## Magic lists

The installer and player both contain some interesting lists
of exe names, window names, and so on. So far I don't know what
these are used for, but I'd guess it's a blacklist system. Your
guess is as good as mine, but the DRM system scans for them every
two seconds.

* [Magic list for installer](sony-drm-magic-list.txt)
* [Magic list for player](sony-drm-magic-list-2.txt)

I've been told these lists are used to hook these processes' APIs to
use the DRM system's noise-adding versions. I haven't been able to
confirm this so far.

## LAME references?

On the CD, the file Contents\GO.EXE contains some strings

```

00056c18  68 74 74 70 3a 2f 2f 77-77 77 2e 6d 70 33 64 65  http://www.mp3de
00056c28  76 2e 6f 72 67 2f 00 00-30 2e 39 30 00 00 00 00  v.org/..0.90....
00056c38  4c 41 4d 45 33 2e 39 35-20 00 00 00 33 2e 39 35  LAME3.95 ...3.95
00056c48  00 00 00 00 33 2e 39 35-20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ....3.95 .......

```

It appears GO.EXE has LAME linked in accidently, but at least the
ECDPlayerControl.ocx does use it as well and is definitely not linked
accidently. Some people have been speculating that this is used to
detect LAME, but that's not the case. The GO.EXE doesn't appear to
refer to this data ever, meaning it's completely unused there. So,
they've screwed up and accidently linked LAME against the installer,
instead of only linking it against the other components in the DRM
system where it's used and needed.

Four files total on the CD (three of them in compressed XCP.DAT)
contain LAME strings, and it appears that at least one of them contains
LAME code as well. **This is certainly copyright infringement**. And
here's Sebastian Porst's blog post, with
[information on LAME code in ECDPlayerControl.ocx](http://www.the-interweb.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/52-Is-Sony-in-violation-of-the-LGPL-Part-II.html) that ships
with the DRM.

Many people have noticed that neither Sony BMG nor F4I appear to be
licensing the MP3 patents, which could make the LAME code a patent
violation as well. However, you should note that the sheer amount of
patents existing today likely covers most of the software out there
in one way or another. This case just happens to be more obvious,
since it contains known software with known patent coverage. Also,
while Sony BMG is not listed, Sony is and at least I don't have any
clue to how patent licensing really works and who needs to do it.
If you plan to make an issue out of the patent situation, please
verify thefacts on your own

## Strange stuff on the XCP.DAT

I've extracted the XCP.DAT that comes on the CD, and inside I've
found the most wondrous stuff. It appears there's stuff like mpglib.dll,
some version of bladeenc dll, etc. Both of these are LGPL, and my
understanding is that these can't be used (or even distributed?) without
mentioning about it in the documentation.

There's also Adaptec's ASPI stuff on the CD, but apparently there's
permission to distribute this stuff. I have no idea, though, I'd have
to research about this a bit more. These end up very visible in the
installed system, though (TMPX dir in windows\system32) so maybe even
F4I isn't stupid enough to infringe with these files

Id3Lib is here as well, in very visible form. There's
nothing mentioned about this on the CD, however sony ships Id3lib
sources on their site along their
[OpenMG stuff](http://www.sony.net/Products/OpenMG/overview/tech.html), and it's unclear if the DRM uses the LGPL version of
this library or the older public domain version.

It appears that the file ECDPlayerControl.OCX actually uses these
LGPL libraries, and since there's no license or mention of this in
the documentation, it would mean that they're not complying with LGPL
here either and thus are infringing copyrights on open source projects.
I wish I could share these files with everyone so others could verify
these facts as well, but that'd be copyright infringement as well :(

## ECDPlayerControl.ocx

### Infringes copyrights on LGPL and GPL code, does things illegal under DMCA and EUCD

The party just keeps on going. In addition to above mentioned
LAME code found here, it appears there's GPL code as well. I'm not
a lawyer, but this could be a DMCA/EUCD violation too? The code in
question is VLC's demux/mp4/drms.c -- the de-DRMS code which circumvents
Apple's DRM. The control flow is the same, the constants are equal
(apparently with one exception), the two magic arrays are equivalent as
well. This includes the p\_secret2 string which is rot13'd Apple
copyright string (used as data by the algorithm).

If you have the XCP on your system, you can go see
ECDPlayerControl.ocx in the system32 dir and search for "Nccyr" in it.
If you have a disassembler, see the function at virtual address
0x10089E00 and compare it to DoShuffle() in drms.c and note the
resemblance.

Also check out Sebastian Porst's post about
[mpglib code found in ECDPlayerControl.ocx](http://www.the-interweb.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/54-Breakthrough-after-breakthrough-in-the-F4I-case.html) and [Sam
Hocevar's confirmation](http://sam.zoy.org/blog/2005-11-21-suspicious-activity-indeed) that it is based on his code and originates
from VLC

### Variable declarations from VLC drms.c DoShuffle()

The p\_secret2 string is rot13'd version of Apple's copyright
string, and is used as data during the DRM process. I suppose apple
put it there to help any legal battles, as it'd clearly flag the
DRM system as something they made, and everyone decoding the
protected works will need to use that string. Jon ran it through
rot13 to avoid having it present in plaintext form. Although the
string is created by Apple, its presence is not indication that
Apple's copyright is being infringed.

### Code from drms.c

Notice that the first three switch cases are outside the
disassembly, although you can see the jumps. The default
case is visible and you can see the code matches.

```

        if( !p_shuffle->p_commands[ i ] )
        {
            continue;
        }

        i_command = (p_shuffle->p_commands[ i ] & 0x300) >> 8;
        i_index = p_shuffle->p_commands[ i ] & 0xff;

        switch( i_command )
        {
        case 0x3:
            p_bordel[ i_index & 0xf ] = p_bordel[ i_index >> 4 ]
                                      + p_bordel[ ((i_index + 0x10) >> 4) & 0xf ];
            break;
        case 0x2:
            p_bordel[ i_index >> 4 ] ^= p_shuffle_xor[ 0xff - i_index ];
            break;
        case 0x1:
            p_bordel[ i_index >> 4 ] -= p_shuffle_sub[ 0xff - i_index ];
            break;
        default:
            p_bordel[ i_index >> 4 ] += p_shuffle_add[ 0xff - i_index ];
            break;
        }

```
### What is DRMS doing there?

[Alex Halderman has
an answer for this.](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=940) Turns out, it's used to *add* (not remove)
the DRM. This way, the CD could've been iTunes compatible. However,
the code is not active, although it's usable and works. There probably
was intention to include this functionality, but F4I/SonyBMG changed
their mind at the last minute and just deactivated it instead of
removing it completely. The reason they used GPL'd code was likely to
speed up the development, reverse engineering it from scratch would've
been more expensive. Copyright infringement was faster to do.
There's a tiny difference in the analyzed code between VLC and XCP that
most likely means it's custom made and intentionally included.
Sebastian Porst has [an annotated disassembly](http://www.the-interweb.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/55-Proof-that-F4I-violates-the-GPL.html) showing how the source matches with the
drms.c code, with this one exception.

### Who's responsible?

I have rather strong opinions on this, however, so read my
[Rant and Whine](rant-and-whine.html) page if you want to
hear about it.

Sony is claiming it's innocent since development was done by F4I,
and they merely licensed the software. The ECDPlayerControl.ocx
however has an interesting string in it, used for debugging,
which reveals information about the developer's filesystem. The project
has been developed in a directory called "XCP Player Code\Sony ActiveX
Player\XCPPlayerControl\", which indicates that Sony had the product
tailored for them, or perhaps even completely custom made. It's
unclear how much Sony BMG knew of the technicalities involved in the
DRM system, however it's obvious that they knew the main features -
taking over the consumer system. They're facing several lawsuits
about it, and it remains for courts to decide if they've broken the
law or not.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
