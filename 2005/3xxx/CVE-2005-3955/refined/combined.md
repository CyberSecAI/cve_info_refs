How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

*Feed2JS v1.7 XSS (Cross-site Scripting) Web Security Vulnerabilities*

Exploit Title: Feed2JS v1.7 magpie_debug.php? &url parameter XSS Security
Vulnerabilities
Product: Feed2JS
Vendor: feed2js.org

Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting [CWE-79]
CVE Reference: *
Impact CVSS Severity (version 2.0):
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) (legend)
Impact Subscore: 2.9
Exploitability Subscore: 8.6
Writer and Reporter: Jing Wang [School of Physical and Mathematical
Sciences (SPMS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore]

*Proposition Details:*

*(1) Vendor & Product Description:*

*Vendor:*
feed2js.org

*Product & Vulnerable Versions:*
Feed2JS
v1.7

*Vendor URL & Download:*
Feed2JS can be downloaded from here,
<https://feed2js.org/index.php?s=download>

*Source code:*
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>

*Product Introduction Overview:*
"What is "Feed to JavaScript? An RSS Feed is a dynamically generated
summary (in XML format) of information or news published on other web
sites- so when the published RSS changes, your web site will be
automatically changed too. It is a rather simple technology that allows
you, the humble web page designer, to have this content displayed in your
own web page, without having to know a lick about XML! Think of it as a box
you define on your web page that is able to update itself, whenever the
source of the information changes, your web page does too, without you
having to do a single thing to it. This Feed2JS web site (new and
improved!) provides you a free service that can do all the hard work for
you-- in 3 easy steps:
    Find the RSS source, the web address for the feed.
    Use our simple tool to build the JavaScript command that will display it
    Optionally style it up to look pretty.

Please keep in mind that feeds are cached on our site for 60 minutes, so if
you add content to your RSS feed, the updates will take at least an hour to
appear in any other web site using Feed2JS to display that feed. To run
these scripts, you need a web server capable of running PHP which is rather
widely available (and free). You will need to FTP files to your server,
perhaps change permissions, and make some basic edits to configure it for
your system. I give you the code, getting it to work is on your shoulders.
I will try to help, but cannot always promise answers."

*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
Feed2JS web application has a computer security bug problem. It can be
exploited by stored XSS attacks. This may allow a remote attacker to create
a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a
user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser
and the server.

Several other Feed2JS products 0-day vulnerabilities have been found by
some other bug hunter researchers before. Feed2JS has patched some of them.
"Openwall software releases and other related files are also available from
the Openwall file archive and its mirrors. You are encouraged to use the
mirrors, but be sure to verify the signatures on software you download. The
more experienced users and software developers may use our CVSweb server to
browse through the source code for most pieces of Openwall software along
with revision history information for each source file. We publish
articles, make presentations, and offer professional services." Openwall
has published suggestions, advisories, solutions details related to XSS
vulnerabilities.

*(2.1)* The first programming code flaw occurs at "&url" parameter in
"magpie_debug.php?" page.
