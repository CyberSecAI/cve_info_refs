{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the usage of the PHP `include()` function with a user-controlled variable `$logout_page` when `register_globals` is enabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Inclusion",
      "Use of `register_globals`"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server. An attacker can include and execute any PHP file from a remote server.",
    "attack_vectors": "HTTP request with the 'action=logout' and 'siteurl' parameters.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. `register_globals` needs to be enabled on the server."

  "affected_software": [
    "PHPCalendar",
    "PHPClique",
    "PHPFanBase",

  ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request. The provided proof-of-concept shows the exact structure of the request. It also suggests turning `register_globals` off and preventing direct access to the vulnerable `protection.php` file, using a constant definition and a check on that constant."
