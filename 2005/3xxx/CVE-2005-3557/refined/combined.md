Hash: SHA1
Advisory: Multiple vulnerabilities in PHPlist
Name: TKADV2005-11-001
Revision: 1.0
Release Date: 2005/11/07
Last Modified: 2005/11/07
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: PHPlist (all versions <= 2.10.1)
Risk: Critical ( ) High (x) Medium (x) Low (x)
Vendor URL: http://www.phplist.com/
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
=========
Overview:
=========
PHPlist is a double opt-in newsletter manager. It is written in
PHP and uses a SQL database for storing the information.
Version 2.10.1 and prior contain multiple Cross Site Scripting
and SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Furthermore it is possible to
access and read arbitrary system files through a vulnerability in
PHPlist.
======================
Vulnerability details:
======================
All vulnerabilites are only exploitable by a legitimate user who is
logged in to PHPlist. So the probability of occurrence of most
threats is rated as medium. The probability of occurrence of the
non-persistent Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities is even rated
as low.
For a description of the calculation of the resulting threat of a
vulnerability see reference [3].
All vulnerabilities are exploitable, no matter if magic\_quotes\_gpc
is turned on or off.
[1] SQL Injection
Possible damage: Critical
Probability of occurrence: Medium
Resulting threat: High
HTTP method: GET
Vulnerability description:
PHPlist is prone to a SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is
due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before
using it in an SQL query.
Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the
application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an
attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database
implementation.
Vulnerable URL:
[path\_to\_phplist]/lists/admin/?page=admin&id=
Proof of Concept:
[path\_to\_phplist]/lists/admin/?page=admin&id=1'

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
