{
  "CVE-2005-3352": {
    "Description": "A flaw in the imagemap processing module, mod_imap, in versions of Apache httpd 1.3, 2.0 and 2.2 can in some circumstances cause the referer header to be output without being escaped in HTML.",
    "Root cause": "The `mod_imap` module fails to properly sanitize the `Referer` directive of imagemaps, leading to the HTTP Referer header being output unescaped.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Input Handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into a user's browser, leading to information gathering (e.g. stealing cookies), potentially impersonating a user, or performing malicious actions within the user's session.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker must entice a victim to visit a URL under the attacker's control, and use a vulnerable server using mod_imap with a map file that contains the `referer` directive.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the `referer` header, and therefore would need to entice a victim to visit a URL under the attackers control."
