| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=175602#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2005-12-13 09:04:20 UTC  ``` From <http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37874>  Summary:  A flaw in the imagemap processing module, mod_imap, in versions of Apache httpd 1.3, 2.0 and 2.2 can in some circumstances cause the referer header to be output without being escaped in HTML.  This could allow an attacker who is able to influence the referer header the ability to do cross-site scripting attacks against sites using mod_imap in a vulnerable configuration.  Impact:   moderate (<http://httpd.apache.org/security/impact_levels.html>)  Mitigation:  This flaw only affects sites using mod_imap with a map file that contains the "referer" directive.  In order to exploit this flaw the attacker would need to control the  referer header and therefore would need to entice a victim to visit a URL under the attackers control.  A sucessful cross-site scripting attack using this flaw would be limited to certain browsers.  Firefox and Mozilla browsers for example already escape suspect characters in a URL which blocks this from being exploited.  Solution:  The attached patch ensures that the referer header in mod_imap is escaped and therefore cannot be used as part of a cross-site scripting attack.  Where this patch cannot be used, a temporary solution is to remove the "referer" directive from any map files.  Verification:  I was able to verify this by constructing a victim site with a vulnerable mod_imap configuration and by constructing a set of scripts on the attacker site.  When the attackers site was visited using the Internet Explorer browser it was able to steal the users private cookies from the victim site.  Patches available at the above URL Affects RHEL4, RHEL3, RHEL2.1   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=175602#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-01-05 15:55:30 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0159.html>    ``` |  |

# USN-241-1: Apache vulnerabilities

13 January 2006

Apache vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

The "mod\_imap" module (which provides support for image maps) did not

properly escape the "referer" URL which rendered it vulnerable against

a cross-site scripting attack. A malicious web page (or HTML email)

could trick a user into visiting a site running the vulnerable mod\_imap,

and employ cross-site-scripting techniques to gather sensitive user

information from that site. ([CVE-2005-3352](/security/CVE-2005-3352))

Hartmut Keil discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the SSL

module ("mod\_ssl") that affects SSL-enabled virtual hosts with a

customized error page for error 400. By sending a specially crafted

request to the server, a remote attacker could crash the server. This

only affects Apache 2, and only if the "worker" implementation

(apache2-mpm-worker) is used. ([CVE-2005-3357](/security/CVE-2005-3357))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* apache2-mpm-worker
  -
* apache-common
  -
* apache2-common
  -

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* apache2-mpm-worker
  -
* apache-common
  -
* apache2-common
  -

##### Ubuntu 4.10

* apache2-mpm-worker
  -
* apache-common
  -
* apache2-common
  -

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=175720#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2005-12-14 10:14:14 UTC  ``` This is a mod_ssl issue which only affects 2.x: <http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37791>  2.0.x patch attached.  It's a remotely-triggered NULL pointer  dereference (so interesting only if you use a threaded MPM), affects  server configurations with an SSL vhost configured with access control  and a custom 400 errordocument; so this is rated "low".   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=175720#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-01-05 15:55:38 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0159.html>    ``` |  |

# Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200602-03**

Apache can be exploited for cross-site scripting attacks and is vulnerable
to a Denial of Service attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.55-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.55-r1**revision >= **2.0.54-r16**= **1.3.34-r2**revision >= **1.3.34-r11**revision >= **1.3.37** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet. mod\_imap provides support for server-side image maps; mod\_ssl
provides secure HTTP connections.

### Description

Apache's mod\_imap fails to properly sanitize the "Referer" directive of
imagemaps in some cases, leaving the HTTP Referer header unescaped. A
flaw in mod\_ssl can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the site uses
a custom "Error 400" document. These vulnerabilities were reported by
Marc Cox and Hartmut Keil, respectively.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit mod\_imap to inject arbitrary HTML or
JavaScript into a user's browser to gather sensitive information.
Attackers could also cause a Denial of Service on hosts using the SSL
module (Apache 2.0.x only).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version, depending on
whether they still use the old configuration style
(/etc/apache/conf/\*.conf) or the new one (/etc/apache2/httpd.conf).

2.0.x users, new style config:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.55-r1"
```

2.0.x users, old style config:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "=www-servers/apache-2.0.54-r16"
```

1.x users, new style config:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "=www-servers/apache-1.3.34-r11"
```

1.x users, old style config:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "=www-servers/apache-1.3.34-r2"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=37874#c0)  Mark Cox    2005-12-12 17:23:25 UTC  ``` Summary:  A flaw in the imagemap processing module, mod_imap, in versions of Apache httpd 1.3, 2.0 and 2.2 can in some circumstances cause the referer header to be output without being escaped in HTML.  This could allow an attacker who is able to influence the referer header the ability to do cross-site scripting attacks against sites using mod_imap in a vulnerable configuration.  Impact:   moderate (<http://httpd.apache.org/security/impact_levels.html>)  Mitigation:  This flaw only affects sites using mod_imap with a map file that contains the "referer" directive.  In order to exploit this flaw the attacker would need to control the  referer header and therefore would need to entice a victim to visit a URL under the attackers control.  A sucessful cross-site scripting attack using this flaw would be limited to certain browsers.  Firefox and Mozilla browsers for example already escape suspect characters in a URL which blocks this from being exploited.  Solution:  The attached patch ensures that the referer header in mod_imap is escaped and therefore cannot be used as part of a cross-site scripting attack.  Where this patch cannot be used, a temporary solution is to remove the "referer" directive from any map files.  Verification:  I was able to verify this by constructing a victim site with a vulnerable mod_imap configuration and by constructing a set of scripts on the attacker site.  When the attackers site was visited using the Internet Explorer browser it was able to steal the users private cookies from the victim site.  Timeline:  20051101 CERT notification of flaw to security@apache.org 20051102 ASF verification of flaw 20051103 Assigned CVE-2005-3352 with proposed patches 20051104 Contacted CERT asking for co-ordinated release and reporter info 20051114 No response from CERT, contacted them again suggesting 20051118 20051114 CERT said they would contact reporter 20051212 No further response from CERT or reporter, made public ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=37874#c1)  Mark Cox    2005-12-12 17:24:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 17199](attachment.cgi?id=17199&action=diff "Patch for apache-1.3 tree (ack fielding, jorton)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17199&action=edit "Patch for apache-1.3 tree (ack fielding, jorton)") Patch for apache-1.3 tree (ack fielding, jorton) ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=37874#c2)  Mark Cox    2005-12-12 17:25:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 17200](attachment.cgi?id=17200&action=diff "Patch for apache-2.0 tree (ack fielding, jorton)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17200&action=edit "Patch for apache-2.0 tree (ack fielding, jorton)") Patch for apache-2.0 tree (ack fielding, jorton) ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=37874#c3)  Mark Cox    2005-12-12 17:26:33 UTC  ``` VU#299838 JPCERT#94453446 JVN#06045169 ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=37874#c4)  Joe Orton    2006-04-11 13:29:13 UTC  ``` The fixes for this were committed a while back:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=357161&view=rev> (trunk) <http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=356291&view=rev> (2.2.x) <http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=356278&view=rev> (1.3.x) <http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=356279&view=rev> (2.0.x)  ``` |  |

# RHSA-2006:0159 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

httpd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0159)

## Topic

Updated Apache httpd packages that correct three security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular and freely-available Web server.

A memory leak in the worker MPM could allow remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption) via aborted connections, which
prevents the memory for the transaction pool from being reused for other
connections. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the
name CVE-2005-2970 to this issue. This vulnerability only affects users
who are using the non-default worker MPM.

A flaw in mod\_imap when using the Referer directive with image maps was
discovered. With certain site configurations, a remote attacker could
perform a cross-site scripting attack if a victim can be forced to visit a
malicious URL using certain web browsers. (CVE-2005-3352)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw in mod\_ssl was discovered affecting server
configurations where an SSL virtual host is configured with access control
and a custom 400 error document. A remote attacker could send a carefully
crafted request to trigger this issue which would lead to a crash. This
crash would only be a denial of service if using the non-default worker
MPM. (CVE-2005-3357)

Users of httpd should update to these erratum packages which contain
backported patches to correct these issues along with some additional bugs.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=171756#c0)  Josh Bressers    2005-10-25 21:58:20 UTC  ``` Memory leak in the worker MPM (worker.c) for Apache 2, in certain circumstances, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via aborted connections, which prevents the memory for the transaction pool from being reused for other connections.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=171756#c1)  Josh Bressers    2005-10-25 21:59:07 UTC  ``` This issue should also affect RHEL3   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=171756#c8)  Mark J. Cox    2005-12-22 13:48:01 UTC  ``` downgraded to low severity, this issue requires the exploitation of a race condition which will be difficult, and in addition will not even cause a DoS unless using the non-default worker MPM.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=171756#c10)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-01-05 15:55:13 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

More details about the issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3352  In addition, new mod_ssl packages for Apache 1.3.35 are available for all of these versions of Slackware, and new versions of PHP are available for Slackware -current.  These additional packages do not fix security issues, but may be required on your system depending on your Apache setup.  One more note about this round of updates:  the packages have been given build versions that indicate which version of Slackware they are meant to patch, such as -1_slack8.1, or -1_slack9.0, etc.  This should help to avoid some of the issues with automatic upgrade tools by providing a unique package name when the same fix is deployed across multiple Slackware versions.  Only patches applied to -current will have the simple build number, such as -1.   Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/apache-1.3.35-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz:   Upgraded to apache-1.3.35.   From the official announcement:     Of particular note is that 1.3.35 addresses and fixes 1 potential     security issue: CVE-2005-3352 (cve.mitre.org)        mod_imap: Escape untrusted referer header before outputting in HTML        to avoid potential cross-site scripting.  Change also made to        ap_escape_html so we escape quotes.  Reported by JPCERT   For more information, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3352   (* Security fix *) patches/packages/mod_ssl-2.8.26_1.3.35-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz:   Upgraded to mod_ssl-2.8.26-1.3.35.

The upgrade should save the important config files for mod_ssl, nevertheless it's a good idea to backup any keys/certificates you wish to save for mod_ssl (in /etc/apache/ssl.*), then upgrade mod_ssl:  # upgradepkg mod_ssl-2.8.26_1.3.35-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz  If necessary, restore any mod_ssl config files.

It may not occur with all versions of glibc, but it has been verified on -current (using an Include within a file already Included causes a crash), so better to patch it and reissue these packages just to be sure.  My apologies if the last batch of updates caused anyone undue grief...  they worked here with my (too simple?) config files.  Note that if you use mod_ssl, you'll also require the mod_ssl package that was part of yesterday's release, and on -current you'll need the newest PHP package (if you use PHP).  Thanks to Francesco Gringoli for bringing this issue to my attention.

Package        : apache
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-3918 CVE-2005-3352
Debian Bug     : 381381 343466

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Apache, the
worlds most popular webserver, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
web script.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2005-3352

   A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw exists in the mod_imap component of
   the Apache server.

CVE-2006-3918

   Apache does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when
   it is reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site
   scripting (XSS) style attacks.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.33-6sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.34-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
