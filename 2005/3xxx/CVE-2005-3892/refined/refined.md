The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Gadu-Gadu instant messenger, version 7.20 and possibly older versions.

**Vulnerabilities:**

**Image Sending:**

*   **Vulnerability #1:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application allows the sender to specify the filename when sending images.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of sanitization of the provided filename.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending an image with a specially crafted filename (e.g., "LPT1:", "AUX:").
    *   **Impact:** Writing the image content to a specific device, potentially causing DoS by blocking the message processing thread if sending "AUX:" twice.
*   **Vulnerability #2:**
    *   **Root cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient filename length checks.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate buffer size on the stack when concatenating the filename with "imgcache\"
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending an image with a filename between 192 and 200 bytes long.
    *   **Impact:** Overwriting the stack (9 bytes), potentially leading to DoS, although difficult to exploit due to stack guards.

**Direct Connections:**

*   **Vulnerability #1:**
    *   **Root cause:** Improper handling of DCC packets.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of memory release after packet processing and an issue with size verification.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a DCC packet with a code different than 2 and specifying the memory allocation size.
    *   **Impact:** Memory exhaustion leading to DoS by repeatedly sending malformed packets.
*   **Vulnerability #2:**
    *   **Root cause:** Error message popups triggered by DCC packets with codes 6 or 7.
    *   **Weakness:** Creation of a thread for each error message received, coupled with no rate limiting or user source identification.
    *   **Attack vector:** Repeatedly sending DCC packets with codes 6 or 7.
    *   **Impact:** Thread exhaustion leading to DoS due to multiple error windows, and potential resource exhaustion if user doesn't close the windows.

**GG Moniker:**

*   **Vulnerability #1:**
    *   **Root cause:**  Improper handling of multiple "gg:" URI references.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper instance creation limitation.
    *   **Attack vector:** Embedding multiple "gg:" references in a web page.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, and potential loss of configuration due to concurrent access issues, leading to DoS.

**GG Phonecalls:**

*   **Vulnerability #1:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application can instantiate the EasycallLite.oce ActiveXObject via a web page and initiate calls.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of user authorization or prompt before making the call from a web page.
    *   **Attack vector:** Creating a malicious web page that instantiates `EasycallLite.oce` and makes a call.
    *   **Impact:** Eavesdropping if the user has a microphone and call initiation without user consent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker can be remote and needs to send specially crafted messages to the victim's client. For some vulnerabilities, a web server is required to serve the malicious web page

**Additional Notes:**

* The vendor released new versions (7 build 21 and 7 build 22) but did not inform the researchers about fixes.
* Proof-of-concept codes are not publicly released.
