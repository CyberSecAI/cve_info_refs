Root cause of vulnerability:
The `chown` command was used incorrectly on symbolic links, modifying the owner of the target file instead of the symlink itself.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Incorrect usage of `chown` command leading to incorrect permission setting on symbolic links. Specifically, the `chown` command was executed without the `-h` option, causing it to change the ownership of the target file instead of the symbolic link.

Impact of exploitation:
Incorrectly restored permissions. Users restoring backups would not be able to restore the correct ownership of symbolic links.

Attack vectors:
When restoring backups, the `storeBackupRecover.pl` script uses `chown` to set the user and group IDs. Without the `-h` flag, the ownership of the file pointed to by the symbolic link will be changed instead of the link itself, leading to privilege escalation.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to restore a backup using storebackup.
