The provided content is a blog post that discusses SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Revize(r) CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The blog post mentions "SQL information disclosure and XSS," indicating that the root cause lies in improper handling of user inputs within the CMS, leading to SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The blog states "SQL information disclosure" which means there is a vulnerability that would allow an attacker to inject SQL commands and gain access to data within the underlying database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The blog explicitly mentions "XSS", indicating the presence of a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** This could lead to sensitive data disclosure, modification or deletion, potentially compromising the entire database.
- **XSS:**  This could allow an attacker to hijack user sessions, deface the website, or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** Attackers can exploit vulnerable input fields or parameters within the application to inject malicious SQL queries.
- **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts through vulnerable input fields or parameters within the application, which are then executed in the browsers of other users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to identify vulnerable input fields or parameters in the web application. They can then craft malicious SQL queries or XSS payloads and inject them into the application. No special privileges are mentioned to be needed.
