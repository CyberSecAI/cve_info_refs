## 1997-2018

Alles kommt zu einem Ende. Schon fr√ºh konnte ich mich f√ºr Technologie begeistern. Also entschied ich mich 1997 zur Gr√ºndung einer "Hacker Community", die verschiedenste Themen diskutieren und Informationen zu diesen austauschen sollte. In den ersten Jahren habe ich f√ºr mich in Anspruch genommen, "alle" nicht-kommerziellen deutschsprachigen Dokumente zu den Themen zur Verf√ºgung zu stellen, habe ein rege besuchtes Forum moderiert und mindestens einmal pro Woche einen Blog-Post publiziert.

Die Hacker Community und der Bereich Cybersecurity haben sich in den vergangenen 20 Jahren stark gewandelt. Das Thema wurde zu einem vitalen Bestandteil unserer technokratischen Gesellschaft, weshalb die Betreuung der Community zunehmend zu einem Vollzeit-Job wurde. Eine Aufgabe, die ich so nicht mehr wahrnehmen wollte und konnte.

Alle Beitr√§ge (Artikel, Posts, Blogs, etc.) werden konserviert und werden irgendwann in Zukunft zur Befriedigung eines "historischen" Interesses ver√∂ffentlicht werden. Einige von ihnen sind nach wie vor wertvoll. Andere wirken im R√ºckblick belustigend, sei es aus technologischer oder gesellschaftlicher Perspektive.

Ich m√∂chte mich explizit bei allen Leuten bedanken, die diese 20 Jahre zu einer spannenden Reise in eine ungewisse Zukunft gemacht haben. Vielen von diesen wurden √ºber diese Zeit zu guten Freunden, mit denen ich auch heute noch regelm√§ssig Kontakt habe. Und daf√ºr bin ich sehr dankbar. Nachfolgend eine partielle Konservierung der Seite und einige Links zu meinen aktuellen Projekten. Ich w√ºnsche nach wie vor viel Spass am Ger√§t!

A vulnerability classified as very critical has been found in [Microsoft Internet Explorer up to 6](?product.microsoft:internet_explorer) ([Web Browser](?type.web_browser)). Affected is an unknown part of the component *Embedded Content Handler*. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a cross site scripting vulnerability. CWE is classifying the issue as [CWE-80](?vulnerability_cwe.1746 "Cwe"). The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages. This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. CVE summarizes:
> The HTML rendering engine in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via HTML in corrupted images and other files such as .GIF, JPG, and WAV, which is rendered as HTML when the user clicks on the link, even though the web server response and file extension indicate that it should be treated as a different file type.

The weakness was released 09/19/2005 by Sven Vetsch (Disenchant) with Redguard AG (Website). The advisory is available at [scip.ch](?advisory_url.1746). This vulnerability is traded as [CVE-2005-3312](?source_cve.1746 "Cve") since 10/26/2005. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploitation doesn't require any form of authentication. Successful exploitation requires user interaction by the victim. Technical details are unknown but a public exploit is available. The structure of the vulnerability defines a possible price range of USD $0-$5k at the moment ([estimation calculated on 10/08/2018](?kb.exploitprices)). It is expected to see the exploit prices for this product decreasing in the near future.This vulnerability is assigned to [T1059.007](?vulnerability_attck.1746 "Attck") by the MITRE ATT&CK project.

The exploit is shared for download at [vuldb.com](?exploit_url.1746). It is declared as proof-of-concept. As 0-day the estimated underground price was around [$25k-$100k](?kb.exploitprices).

Applying a patch is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at [windowsupdate.microsoft.com](?countermeasure_patch_url.1746). The problem might be mitigated by replacing the product with as an alternative. The best possible mitigation is suggested to be establishing an alternative product.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city‚Äôs water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

phpBB 2.0.17 (and other BB systems as well) Cookie disclosure exploit.

I sent the report to phpBB and they said that a patch will be available withing a few \
days and It will be integrated into 2.0.18 .

Note: This works like XSS, and requires the victim to use IE (Affects all versions of \
IE).

Special Credits to: Sven Vetsch (the original finder of "The gif bug").
The original gif-bug article : \
<http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/6F00B00EBY.html> Also thanks to the experts \
at securiteam.com for clarifying some issues.

Since what is described in the original article doesn't work, I have written this \
step-by-step article explaining how to replicate this bug successfuly.

Affected: All phpBB systems allowing "Upload Avatar from URL" and most likely all \
other systems with such a feature (Other bulletin boards - but I didn't check).

Well, the base for the problem lies within IE.. The core element of my Proof of \
Concept is the lately found Gif-bug in IE (Originally found by Sven Vetsch).

For some reason IE renders malformed embedded content files (like gif,jpg,wav,and so \
on..) as HTML when they are accessed directly e.g. <http://attacker.com/xss.gif> (Not \
through the <img> tag).

If we create an HTML file and rename its extention to .GIF (or other embedded content \
file extention), and upload it to an HTTP server (it dosn't work locally for some \
reason), when we will navigate to <http://myserver.com/xss.gif> the HTML code will be \
executed instead of showing that the image is invalid.

So, if we could upload such a file to a server that allows image upload we could \
actually upload HTML code instead (Inside the image file). If the victim will be \
lured to navigate to this  specially crafted image in IE, arbitary HTML code could be \
executed in the servers security zone, e.g. we could steall the users cookie, for \
example.

However it is not that simple with systems (like phpBB) that verify the image file \
before it is uploaded to the server. If we try to upload our previosly made \
<http://attacker.com/xss.gif> gif file the system will complain about incorrect image \
size - that's because our image is invalid. The verification system chechs the files \
header. In a valid 1x1 gif file the header should be (in hex) : 47 49 46 38 39 61 01 \
00 01 00 . After the header we will insert the next HTML code: \
<HTML><HEAD><SCRIPT>alert(document.cookie);</SCRIPT></HEAD></HTML> So the file will \
look like this (in hex): 47 49 46 38 39 61 01 00 01 00 3C 48 54 4D 4C 3E 3C 48 45 41 \
44 3E 3C 53 43 52 49 50 54 3E 61 6C 65

72 74 28 64 6F 63 75 6D 65 6E 74 2E 63 6F 6F 6B 69 65 29 3B 3C 2F 53 43 52 49 50 54 \
3E 3C 2F 48 45

41 44 3E 3C 2F 48 54 4D 4C 3E

If we upload this file instead the old one to : <http://myserver.com/xss.gif> we will \
be able to upload it as a phpBB avatar. However when we access the file directly (as \
before) no HTML code is going to be executed. That is because IE sees the valid \
header and tries to draw the image  instead of rendering the HTML (and fails anyway \
...).

However if we change the file extention from .GIF to .JPG the GIF header in the \
beginning will become meaningless to IE and the HTML code will be executed. So if we \
rename our image from  xss.gif to xss.jpg when we will navigate to \
<http://myserver.com/xss.jpg> we will see an alert box (that should show the cookie on \
its current server).

The phpBB avatar upload system verifies the files header - and our header is pretty \
much valid - for a GIF file, but not JPG. If we try to upload the file \
<http://myserver.com/xss.jpg> as our avatar it will be successfuly uploaded. Hence any \
one who will navigate (in IE) directly to our avatar in

its new address on the phpBB forum server (the URL should look like \
<http://phpbbforum.com/phpbb/>

images/avatars/2131121a2121f.jpg) will be able to see his cookie information in an \
alert window. Instead an image something like GIF89a_--. will apear, but it can be \
easily obfuscated with a simple JavaScript.

As a Proof of Concept here is a ready made JPG file: (Save target as) \
<http://planet.nana.co.il/>

mycoolpictures123/fake/lt2.jpg . Upload this (from its current location, or your HTTP \
server) as an avatar to phpBB (or as I believe - any Bulletin Board system). In your \
avatar an invalid image (red X) will appear, but when you navigate to it's current \
location (e.g. <http://phpbbforum.com/>

phpbb/images/avatars/2131121a2121f.jpg) you will see an alert with your cookie.

Using the basic idea of my PoC, the code can be manipulated to send a users cookie \
information to  a CGI sniffer on a remote server. All that should be done is sending \
a message saying "Check out this image" and specifying the avatars URL.

This is a major problem since 90% of the internet users use IE and lots of dynamic \
sites (like  bulletin boards) allow image upload to the server.

The solution could come in many ways. The best solution for the user is to use \
another browser (like FireFox) untill a vendor patch from Micrsoft is available. For \
bulletin board administrators it is highly advised to turn off the "Upload avatar \
from URL" option untill a patch from the vendor (phpBB, vBulletin, IPB, and so on...) \
arrives.

Have a good day.
