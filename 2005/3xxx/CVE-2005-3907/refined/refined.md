Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2005-3907:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An unspecified vulnerability exists within the Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that allows a Java applet to bypass security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is the ability of an untrusted Java applet to circumvent the intended security mechanisms within the JRE. This allows the applet to gain unauthorized access and manipulation of system resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious Java applet delivered to the vulnerable system. This could occur through various means:
    - A user visiting a malicious website hosting the applet.
    - A user opening a malicious email attachment containing the applet.
    - Any other method of delivering the applet to a target system running a vulnerable JRE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious Java applet to a system running a vulnerable version of the JRE.
- No specific system privileges are required initially, as the exploit bypasses JRE security.
- The attacker could be positioned anywhere on the network, depending on the method of applet delivery.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is resolved by upgrading to Java Development Kit and Java Runtime Environment 5.0 Update 4 or later.
- The CERT advisory also recommends avoiding Java applets from untrusted sources and disabling Java within the web browser.
- The vulnerability was reported by Sun Microsystems, with credit to Adam Gowdiak for providing information.
- The Secunia advisory ID is 17748.
