Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2005-3123:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a path traversal issue in gnump3d, a streaming server for MP3 and OGG files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The server does not properly validate URLs, allowing an attacker to construct special URLs that access arbitrary files on the server's file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server's file system that the gnump3d process has access to, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially crafted URLs:** The attacker crafts a URL containing path traversal sequences (e.g., ../) to navigate the server's file system outside of the intended directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable gnump3d server. No specific user privileges are mentioned.
