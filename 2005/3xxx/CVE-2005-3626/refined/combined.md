CERT advisory  :
BugTraq ID     :
Debian Bug     : 342292

"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which is
also present in tetex-bin, the binary files of teTeX, and which can
lead to a denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to
the execution of arbitrary code.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.7+20011202-7.7.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.2-30sarge4.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.3-2 of poppler against which tetex-bin links.

We recommend that you upgrade your tetex-bin package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Xpdf, Poppler, GPdf, libextractor, pdftohtml: Heap overflows — GLSA **200601-17**

Xpdf, Poppler, GPdf, libextractor and pdftohtml are vulnerable to integer
overflows that may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/xpdf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.01-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.01-r5** |

| Package | **app-text/poppler** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.4.3-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.4.3-r4** |

| Package | **app-text/gpdf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.10.0-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.10.0-r3** |

| Package | **media-libs/libextractor** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.5.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.5.9** |

| Package | **app-text/pdftohtml** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.36-r4** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

Xpdf is a PDF file viewer that runs under the X Window System.
Poppler is a PDF rendering library based on the Xpdf 3.0 code base.
GPdf is a PDF file viewer for the GNOME 2 platform, also based on Xpdf.
libextractor is a library which includes Xpdf code to extract arbitrary
meta-data from files. pdftohtml is a utility to convert PDF files to
HTML or XML formats that makes use of Xpdf code to decode PDF files.

### Description

Chris Evans has reported some integer overflows in Xpdf when
attempting to calculate buffer sizes for memory allocation, leading to
a heap overflow and a potential infinite loop when handling malformed
input files.

### Impact

By sending a specially crafted PDF file to a victim, an attacker
could cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Xpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/xpdf-3.01-r5"
```

All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/poppler-0.4.3-r4"
```

All GPdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/gpdf-2.10.0-r3"
```

All libextractor users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libextractor-0.5.9"
```

All pdftohtml users should migrate to the latest stable version
of Poppler.

## Synopsis

gpdf security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0177)

## Topic

An updated gpdf package that fixes several security issues is now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

gpdf is a GNOME based viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.

Chris Evans discovered several flaws in the way gpdf processes PDF files.
An attacker could construct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause
gpdf to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the names CVE-2005-3624,
CVE-2005-3625, CVE-2005-3626, and CVE-2005-3627 to these issues.

Users of gpdf should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
backported patch to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

Package        : koffice
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-3191 CVE-2005-3193 CVE-2005-3624 CVE-2005-3625
                 CVE-2005-3626 CVE-2005-3627 CVE-2005-3628

"infamous41md" and chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which is
also present in koffice, the KDE Office Suite, and which can lead to a
denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to the
execution of arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain koffice packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.5-4.sarge.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.2-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your koffice package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Package        : xpdf
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-3191 CVE-2005-3192 CVE-2005-3193 CVE-2005-3624

Debian Bug     : 342281

"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, that can
lead to a denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to
the execution of arbitrary code.  The same code is present in kpdf
which is part of the kdegraphics package.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain kpdf packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2-2sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.0-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your kpdf package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 940-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
January 13th, 2006                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : gpdf
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-3191 CVE-2005-3192 CVE-2005-3624 CVE-2005-3625
                 CVE-2005-3626 CVE-2005-3627 CVE-2005-3628

"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which is
also present in gpdf, the GNOME version of the Portable Document
Format viewer, and which can lead to a denial of service by crashing
the application or possibly to the execution of arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain gpdf packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.2-1.2sarge2

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your gpdf package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# KPdf, KWord: Multiple overflows in included Xpdf code — GLSA **200601-02**

KPdf and KWord both include vulnerable Xpdf code to handle PDF files,
making them vulnerable to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **kde-base/kdegraphics** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.4.3-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.4.3-r3** |

| Package | **kde-base/kpdf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.4.3-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.4.3-r3** |

| Package | **app-office/koffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.2-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.2-r6** |

| Package | **app-office/kword** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.2-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.2-r6** |

### Background

KPdf is a KDE-based PDF viewer included in the kdegraphics package.
KWord is a KDE-based word processor also included in the koffice
package.

### Description

KPdf and KWord both include Xpdf code to handle PDF files. This Xpdf
code is vulnerable to several heap overflows (GLSA 200512-08) as well
as several buffer and integer overflows discovered by Chris Evans
(CESA-2005-003).

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF file
with Kpdf or KWord, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running the affected application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All kdegraphics users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdegraphics-3.4.3-r3"
```

All Kpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kpdf-3.4.3-r3"
```

All KOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/koffice-1.4.2-r6"
```

All KWord users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/kword-1.4.2-r6"
```

KDE Security Advisory [UPDATED]: kpdf/xpdf multiple integer overflows
Original Release Date: 2005-12-07
Final Release Date: 2006-01-03
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20051207-2.txt

CVE-2005-3626
CVE-2005-3627
CESA-2005-003
1. Systems affected:
KDE 3.2.0 up to including KDE 3.5.0
KOffice 1.3.0 up to including KOffice 1.4.2
2. Overview:
kpdf, the KDE pdf viewer, shares code with xpdf. xpdf contains
multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities that allow specially
crafted pdf files, when opened, to overflow heap allocated
buffers and execute arbitrary code.
The patches announced in the KDE security advisory 20051207-1
were incomplete. This re-issued advisory contains updated patches
that correct issues with the original upstream patch that were
found and fixed by Ludwig Nussel, Martin Pitt and Chris Evans.
The previous patches and advisory have been removed.
3. Impact:
Remotely supplied pdf files can be used to execute arbitrary
code on the client machine.
4. Solution:
Source code patches have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.

CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-3191 CVE-2005-3192 CVE-2005-3193 CVE-2005-3624
                 CVE-2005-3625 CVE-2005-3626 CVE-2005-3627 CVE-2005-3628

"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf which are also present in pdfkit.framework, the
GNUstep framework for rendering PDF content, and which can lead to a
denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to the
execution of arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdfkit.framework
packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8-2sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your pdfkit.framework package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Vendor notified date: Dec 11th 2005
Note: Some of these vulnerabilities overlap with some independently noted
vulnerabilities such as
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=342
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=343
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=344
The PDF format presents a somewhat large attack surface. Previous advisories
such as CESA-2004-002 and CESA-2004-007 dealt with attacks against the
PDF framework which defines a series of objects and their relations. This
advisory demonstrates attacks against the binary (and other) encodings used for
some objects in PDF files.
xpdf and derivatives support approaching 10 different encodings.
Details
=======
1) Out-of-bounds heap accesses with large or negative parameters to
"FlateDecode" stream.
User-supplied integers (negative or large) are not checked for overflow or
underflow in buffer size calculations in
Stream.cc:StreamPredictor::StreamPredictor().
Demo pdf: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/pending/bad7.pdf
On a system with a modern glibc, this will cause xpdf to exit:
\*\*\* glibc detected \*\*\* double free or corruption (out): 0x0818a038 \*\*\*
2) Out-of-bounds heap accesses with large or negative parameters to
"CCITTFaxDecode" stream.
User-supplied integers (negative or large) are not checked for overflow or
underflow in buffer size calculations in
Stream.cc::CCITTFaxStream::CCITTFaxStream().
Demo pdf: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/pending/bad8.pdf
Causes a segfault.
3) Infinite CPU spins in various places when stream ends unexpectedly. Probably
repeated at various locations in the code.
The following demos trigger issues in the "CCITTFaxDecode" and "DCTDecode"
streams.
Demo pdf: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/pending/bad9.pdf
Demo pdf: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/pending/bad10.pdf
4) NULL pointer crash in the "FlateDecode" stream.
Although a crash in client software is more of a reliability issue than a
security issue, it still denotes a lack of robustness.
Demo pdf: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/pending/bad6.pdf
5) Overflows of compInfo array in "DCTDecode" stream.
User-supplied "number of components" value not checked against maximum of
4 in Stream.cc:DCTStream::readBaselineSOF() and
Stream.cc:DCTStream::readProgressiveSOF().
Demo pdf: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/pending/bad11.pdf (readBaselineSOF)
Demo pdf: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/pending/bad12.pdf (readProgressiveSOF)
Note - demos don't produce crashes. Haven't tuned them yet. Have validated
in the debugger that writes are occurring outside the intended array. The
overflow amount is limited, and the structure being overflowed is followed by
some very large structures, so what can be overwritten may be limited. However,
there are some very interesting things to overwrite such as the actual count
driving the loop which is doing the overwriting! This should unlimit the
amount of the overflow.
6) Possible to use index past end of array in "DCTDecode" stream.
User-supplied "Huffman table index" value not always checked against maximum
size in Stream.cc:DCTStream::readHuffmanTables().
Demo pdf: http://scary.beasts.org/misc/pending/bad13.pdf
Again, demo does not cause crash - it is untuned. Possible caveats along the
lines of point 5) too.
7) More possible out-of-bounds indexing trouble in "DCTDecode" stream.
See usage of scanInfo.numComps in Stream.cc:DCTStream::readScanInfo().

Package        : cupsys
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-3191 CVE-2005-3192 CVE-2005-3193 CVE-2005-3624
                 CVE-2005-3625 CVE-2005-3626 CVE-2005-3627 CVE-2005-3628

"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf which are also present in CUPS, the Common UNIX
Printing System, and which can lead to a denial of service by crashing
the application or possibly to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.14-5woody14.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.23-10sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your CUPS packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 962-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
February 1st, 2006                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : pdftohtml
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-3191 CVE-2005-3192 CVE-2005-3193 CVE-2005-3624
                 CVE-2005-3625 CVE-2005-3626 CVE-2005-3627 CVE-2005-3628

"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf which are also present in pdftohtml, a utility that
translates PDF documents into HTML format, and which can lead to a
denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to the
execution of arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdftohtml packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.36-11sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your pdftohtml package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : libextractor
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2005-3191 CVE-2005-3192 CVE-2005-3193 CVE-2005-2097
                 CVE-2005-3624 CVE-2005-3625 CVE-2005-3626 CVE-2005-3627
                 CVE-2005-3628

"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which is
also present in libextractor, a library to extract arbitrary meta-data
from files, and which can lead to a denial of service by crashing the
application or possibly to the execution of arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain libextractor
packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.2-2sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.8-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libextractor packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
