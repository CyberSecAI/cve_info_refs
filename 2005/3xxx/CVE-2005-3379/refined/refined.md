The provided content is related to CVE-2005-3379.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the scanning engine of multiple antivirus products where the file type determination logic is flawed. Specifically, by prepending the "magic byte" of an executable file (MZ) to other file types (like .BAT, .HTML, .EML), the antivirus software misidentifies the file type, thus failing to detect malicious content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper file type identification.
- Reliance on magic bytes for file type determination without additional validation or checks.
- Inability to detect malicious code when file types are disguised with incorrect magic bytes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Evasion of antivirus detection, allowing malicious files to bypass security measures.
- Execution of undetected malicious code.
- Potential compromise of systems due to the successful execution of malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- Prepending the magic byte of executable files (MZ) to other file types like .bat, .html and .eml files that can still be executed even with the added bytes at the beginning.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to modify or create malicious files and prepend the magic bytes to those files.
- Ability to deliver or distribute the crafted files to the target system where the vulnerable antivirus software is used.
