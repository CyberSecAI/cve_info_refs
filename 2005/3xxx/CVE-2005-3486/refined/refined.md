    {
      "type": "Format String Vulnerability",
      "location": "GLConsole::addLine, ServerCommon::sendString*, ServerCommon::serverLog",
      "description": "The game uses vsprintf with static buffers and user-controlled input directly as format arguments, leading to format string vulnerabilities.",
        "impact": "Allows remote attackers to crash the game server or execute arbitrary code with the rights of the game server user.",

      "type": "Buffer Overflow",
      "location": "GLConsole::addLine, ServerCommon::sendString*, ServerCommon::serverLog",
        "description": "Multiple buffer overflows exist in the GLConsole::addLine, ServerCommon::sendString*, and ServerCommon::serverLog functions due to the use of vsprintf with static buffers of various lengths. User input is directly used to create strings leading to potential buffer overflows.",

      "location": "ServerConnectHandler.cpp",
       "description": "The server can be frozen by providing a negative value for the 'numplayers' field. This bypasses the signed check and causes an infinite loop when creating new players.",
