Summary
=======
Cisco Security Agent (CSA) is a security software agent that provides
threat protection for server and desktop computing systems. CSA
agents can be managed by CiscoWorks VMS Management Center for Cisco
Security Agents or can be standalone agents running on Cisco IP
Communications application servers. Standalone agents for Cisco IP
Communications application servers must be manually installed on the
IP Communications application server.
A vulnerability exists in CSA agents that can allow a privilege
escalation through locally executed software, providing a normal user
or attacker with local system level privileges on a Windows
workstation or server running managed or standalone CSA 4.5.0 or
4.5.1 agents.
Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers.
This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20051129-csa.shtml

for Cisco Security Agent on your CiscoWorks server. Complete these
steps:
1. Login at:
http://ciscoworks-hostname:1741/
2. Select the "Security Agents" tab under:
+ VPN/Security Management Solution
o Management Center
# Security Agents
This launchs the "Management Center for Cisco Security Agents."
3. Within the browser window, locate the tab in the center marked "
Help."
4. Click the sub-item labeled "About." The version of the Cisco
Security Agents appears in a pop-up window containing text
similar to:
Management Center for Cisco Security Agents V4.5-1 build 616.
Note: You can only manage CSA 4.5.X Agents with Version 4.5-X (any
build) Management Center for Cisco Security Agents.
Details
=======
Cisco Security Agent provides threat protection for server and
desktop computing systems. Vulnerable versions of Cisco Security
Agent may allow software executed locally to bypass systems
protections and run with elevated privileges resulting in normal
users and attackers obtaining local system level privileges.
Agent checks configured to prevent malicious software from running on
a CSA protected system will be active; however, any checks that occur
after successful exploitation may be bypassed.
This issue is not related to a Microsoft Operating System issue nor
can a CSA policy modification change this behavior.
This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID
CSCsc42373 ( registered customers only)
For information about local system level privileges, refer to:
\* LocalSystem Account
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/
dllproc/base/localsystem\_account.asp
Impact
======
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in a normal
user or attacker gaining full control of the system, including the
disabling of the CSA agent.
Software Versions and Fixes
===========================
When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a
complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.
The fixed version of the Cisco Security Agent software requires no
more resources than older 4.5.0 and 4.5.1 builds. It should be
suitable for any system currently running 4.5.0 or 4.5.1.
