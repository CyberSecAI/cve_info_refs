Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient buffer size allocation when handling data blocks after the initial handshake. Specifically, the application uses 16-bit fields to indicate the length of subsequent data blocks. Both client and server use small buffers. An attacker can send a data block larger than the allocated buffer leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow, occurring when the application attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer space.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the length of incoming data blocks before processing them.
*   **Vulnerable Data Handling:**  The use of 16-bit fields for length specification combined with undersized buffers makes the application susceptible to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite memory locations and potentially gain control of the program's execution flow. This could result in arbitrary code execution on the server and client machines
*   **Denial of Service:** Exploitation can lead to application crashes, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Exploitation can occur remotely through network communication with either the server or the client. Attackers send specially crafted network packets with oversized data blocks to trigger the overflow.
*   **Client-Server:** Both server and client components of GO-Global are vulnerable, allowing attackers to target either side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to communicate with the GO-Global server or client over the network.
*   **Packet Crafting:**  Attackers require the ability to craft and send packets containing data blocks that exceed the expected buffer size.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability affects GO-Global for Windows versions up to and including 3.1.0.3270
* The vulnerability affects both the server and client components of the application.
* Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits were released to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* A fix was released in version 3.1.0.3281
