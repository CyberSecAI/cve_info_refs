Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in aRCHILLES Newsworld, as described in the marc.info entry:

**Vulnerability 1: Information Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application stores user data, including usernames, password hashes, and email addresses, in plain text files (`account.nwd`).
*   **Weakness:**  Sensitive user information is directly accessible by reading the text file, without any access control mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Direct access to the `account.nwd` file, which is located in a web-accessible directory.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to access the file, likely by guessing or knowing its path and being able to send HTTP requests for it.

**Vulnerability 2: Login Bypass (Versions <= 1.3.0)**

*   **Root Cause:** The script allows login using parameters passed directly to the `admin_news.php` file with the username and the password hash.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation in the login process allows attackers to bypass the standard login form.
*  **Impact:** Attackers can directly access the administration interface without knowing the actual password.
*   **Attack Vector:** Directly accessing admin_news.php with crafted URL parameters (action, id, usr, pwd), using the password hash obtained from the information disclosure vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to know the location of the admin page and its parameters and have already obtained the user credentials through Vulnerability 1.

**Vulnerability 3: Login Bypass (Versions > 1.3.0)**

*   **Root Cause:** Session data, including session IDs, user IDs, usernames, password hashes, and timestamps, are stored in a text file (`session.nwd`).
*   **Weakness:**  Sessions are stored in a plain text file, which can be accessed without restriction.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can hijack valid user sessions and gain administrative access if an admin session id is obtained.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Direct access to the `session.nwd` file to obtain a valid session ID, and then accessing admin_news.php with the obtained session ID as a `PHPSESSID` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to read the file `session.nwd` and obtain a valid session ID of a logged-in user.

**Summary:**

The core issue is that sensitive data is stored in plain text files within the web directory, allowing for information disclosure and login bypass. The vulnerabilities are due to:

*   Storing user credentials in plain text files
*   Using URL parameters to authenticate users
*   Storing session data in plain text files
