How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# eix: Insecure temporary file creation — GLSA **200511-19**

eix has an insecure temporary file creation vulnerability, potentially
allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-portage/eix** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.5.0\_pre2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.5.0\_pre2**revision >= **0.3.0-r2** |

### Background

eix is a small utility for searching ebuilds with indexing for fast
results.

### Description

Eric Romang discovered that eix creates a temporary file with a
predictable name. eix creates a temporary file in /tmp/eix.\*.sync where
\* is the process ID of the shell running eix.

### Impact

A local attacker can watch the process list and determine the process
ID of the shell running eix while the "emerge --sync" command is
running, then create a link from the corresponding temporary file to a
system file, which would result in the file being overwritten with the
rights of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All eix users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose app-portage/eix
```
### References

| [Description](#c0)  Romang    2005-11-10 02:43:17 UTC  ``` Hello,  Take a look at src/eix-sync.in :  46 cp /var/cache/eix /tmp/eix.$$.sync || die "Error while copying cache-file to a save location        ." diff-eix /tmp/eix.$$.sync          || die "Error while diffing."  Regards. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-11 01:14:19 UTC  ``` Auditors please confirm.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-11 01:49:46 UTC  ``` confirmed, but it's not a race condition, it's a second order insecure temporary  file handling issue. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-13 10:15:52 UTC  ``` ccing maintainer. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Benedikt Böhm (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-17 07:01:04 UTC  ``` can someone explain what's the problem with this?  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-17 07:20:54 UTC  ``` A local attacker can watch the process list and determine what $$ is while the "emerge --sync" part is running, then create a link at the corresponding tmpfile to a system file, say /etc/passwd... and bring down the host.  The fact that this runs as root and may be part of a cron job makes things even worse.   Doing a mktemp before the emerge --sync to safely create a random file that you will use afterwards to hold your temporary contents would be much better. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Benedikt Böhm (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-17 15:55:02 UTC  ``` ok, it's fixed with 0.3.0-r2 and also in upstream svn for 0.5.0  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-18 05:06:08 UTC  ``` Thx Benedikt,  Arches please test 0.3.0-r2 and mark stable : Target KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 ia64 ~mips ppc sparc x86"  ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-18 05:56:21 UTC  ``` sparc stable.  ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Andrej Kacian (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-18 07:25:07 UTC  ``` x86 happy ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Luis Medinas (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-18 17:24:37 UTC  ``` stable on amd64 ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Fernando J. Pereda (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-19 07:39:45 UTC  ``` alpha'lized  Cheers, Ferdy ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Michael Hanselmann (hansmi) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-19 11:04:00 UTC  ``` Stable on ppc. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-20 04:15:15 UTC  ``` This one is ready for GLSA decision. I vote YES.  ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-21 01:10:46 UTC  ``` I vote yes too. This is easy to exploit, and can be run as root as part of normal operations. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-21 01:14:30 UTC  ``` The ppc keyword was never applied, apparently. ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Joe Jezak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-21 11:22:15 UTC  ``` hansmi marked it ppc stable today, removing ppc. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-11-22 14:48:52 UTC  ``` GLSA 200511-19    ia64 don't forget to mark stable to benifit from the GLSA.  ``` |  |
