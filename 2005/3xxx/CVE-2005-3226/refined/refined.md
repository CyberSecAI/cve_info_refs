The provided content describes a vulnerability related to antivirus detection bypass using specially crafted archive files, specifically RAR and CAB files.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way some antivirus software scans archive files. By crafting a malicious payload within a RAR or CAB archive in a specific way, it is possible to evade detection during the initial scan.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate scanning of archive file contents by certain antivirus products, allowing malicious files to remain undetected while within the archive.
- Inconsistent handling of archive files, with some antivirus solutions flagging the malicious content and others not.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can successfully distribute malware by packaging it within specially crafted archive files.
- The malicious payload is not detected until after the archive is extracted, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves distributing malicious archive files via email, file sharing, or other channels.
- Users are tricked into opening/extracting the archive, at which point the malicious content is exposed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers require the ability to create specially crafted archive files that bypass the scanning mechanisms of some antivirus software.
- They require a way to distribute these crafted archives to victim machines.
- Basic knowledge of archive file structure and the ability to compress files is necessary.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) using the EICAR test file within RAR and CAB archives and the results of scanning those archives with various antivirus products, highlighting the inconsistent results.
The crafted archives (SecuBox_AVPoC1.rar, SecuBox_AVPoC2.rar, SecuBox_AVPoC3.cab) were used to demonstrate the bypass.
The specific techniques for crafting these archives are not detailed.
The report notes that while some tools like Winzip and BitZipper would not open the crafted files, other software like WinRAR and PowerZip did, highlighting the issue in archive processing.
The test also showed that ClamAV, when scanning the archive file directly, did not detect the EICAR file, but after extraction, it was detected. This indicates a failure to scan within the archive file itself in some cases.
