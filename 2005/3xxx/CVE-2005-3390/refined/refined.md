  "CVE-2005-3390": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way PHP registers global variables during a file upload request. A remote attacker could submit a carefully crafted multipart/form-data POST request that would overwrite the $GLOBALS array, altering expected script behavior, and possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary PHP commands.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how PHP handles file uploads with `multipart/form-data` POST requests. Specifically, during file upload processing, PHP fails to adequately prevent overwriting the `$GLOBALS` array when `register_globals` is enabled, due to a flaw in the code that was added to prevent this overwrite for GET, POST, and COOKIE variables.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate input validation and sanitization when handling file upload requests.",
         "Failure to prevent modification of the `$GLOBALS` array during variable registration, specifically for file uploads.",
        "Reliance on the 'register_globals' feature, which allows external data to directly influence global variables, leading to insecure practices."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially overwrite the `$GLOBALS` array, which can lead to unexpected behavior in PHP applications, possibly including the execution of arbitrary PHP code. This can lead to a complete compromise of the web application and the server hosting it.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted `multipart/form-data` POST request that contains a file upload field named `GLOBALS`.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable PHP application and does not require any authentication or special privileges.",
    },
        "affected_versions": {
            "php4": "<= 4.4.0",
            "php5": "<= 5.0.5"
        }
