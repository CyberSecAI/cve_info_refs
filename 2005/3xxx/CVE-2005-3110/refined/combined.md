Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the
Linux kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilieis and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2004-2302

    A race condition in the sysfs filesystem allows local users to
    read kernel memory and cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2005-0756

    Alexander Nyberg discovered that the ptrace() system call does not
    properly verify addresses on the amd64 architecture which can be
    exploited by a local attacker to crash the kernel.

CVE-2005-0757

    A problem in the offset handling in the xattr file system code for
    ext3 has been discovered that may allow users on 64-bit systems
    that have access to an ext3 filesystem with extended attributes to
    cause the kernel to crash.

CVE-2005-1265

    Chris Wright discovered that the mmap() function could create
    illegal memory maps that could be exploited by a local user to
    crash the kernel or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2005-1761

    A vulnerability on the IA-64 architecture can lead local attackers
    to overwrite kernel memory and crash the kernel.

CVE-2005-1762

    A vulnerability has been discovered in the ptrace() system call on
    the amd64 architecture that allowas a local attacker to cause the
    kernel to crash.

CVE-2005-1763

    A buffer overflow in the ptrace system call for 64-bit
    architectures allows local users to write bytes into arbitrary
    kernel memory.

CVE-2005-1765

    Zou Nan Hai has discovered that a local user could cause the
    kernel to hang on the amd64 architecture after invoking syscall()
    with specially crafted arguments.

CVE-2005-1767

    A vulnerability has been discovered in the stack segment fault
    handler that could allow a local attacker to cause stack exception
    that will leed the kernel to crash under certain circumstances.

CVE-2005-2456

    Balazs Scheidler discovered that a local attacker could call
    setsockopt() with an invalid xfrm_user policy message which would
    cause the kernel to write beyond the boundaries of an array and
    crash.

CVE-2005-2458

    Vladimir Volovich discovered a bug in the zlib routines which are
    also present in the Linux kernel and allows remote attackers to
    krash the kernel

CVE-2005-2459

    Another vulnerability has been discovered in the zlib routines
    which are also present in the Linux kernel and allows remote
    attackers to crash the kernel

CVE-2005-2548

    Peter Sandstrom noticed that snmpwalk from a remote host could
    cause a denial of service (kernel oops from null dereference) via
    certain UDP packets that lead to a function call with the wrong
    argument.

CVE-2005-2801

    Andreas Gruenbacher discovered a bug in the ext2 and ext3 file
    systems.  When data areas are to be shared among two inodes not
    all information were compared for equality, which could expose
    wrong ACLs for files.

CVE-2005-2872

    Chad Walstrom discovered that the ipt_recent kernel module on
    64-bit processors such as AMD64 ows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (kernel panic) via certain attacks such as SSH
    brute force.

CVE-2005-3105

    The mprotect code on Itanium IA-64 Montecito processors does not
    properly maintain cache coherency as required by the architecture,
    which allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly
    corrupt data by modifying PTE protections.

CVE-2005-3106

    A race condition in the thread management may allow local users to
    cause a denial of service (deadlock) when threads are sharing
    memory and waiting for a thread that has just performed an exec.

CVE-2005-3107

    When one thread is tracing another thread that shares the same
    memory map a local user could cause a denial of service (deadlock)
    by forcing a core dump when the traced thread is in the
    TASK_TRACED state.

CVE-2005-3108

    A bug in the ioremap() system call has been discovered on the
    amd65 architecture that could allow local users to cause a
    denial of service or an information leak when performing a lookup
    of a non-existant memory page.

CVE-2005-3109

    The HFS and HFS+ (hfsplus) modules allow local attackers to cause
    a denial of service (oops) by using hfsplus to mount a filesystem
    that is not hfsplus.

CVE-2005-3110

    A race ondition in the ebtables netfilter module on an SMB system
    running under high load may allow remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2005-3271

    Roland McGrath discovered exec() does not properly clear
    posix-timers in multi-threaded environments, which results in a
    resource leak and could allow a large number of multiple local
    users to cause a denial of service by using more posix-timers than
    specified by the quota for a single user.

CVE-2005-3272

    The kernel allows remote attackers to poison the bridge forwarding
    table using frames that have already been dropped by filtering,
    which can cause the bridge to forward spoofed packets.

CVE-2005-3273

    The ioctl for the packet radio ROSE protocol does not properly
    verify the arguments when setting a new router, which allows
    attackers to trigger out-of-bounds errors.

CVE-2005-3274

    A race condition in on SMP systems allows local users to cause a
    denial of service (null dereference) by causing a connection timer
    to expire while the connection table is being flushed before the
    appropriate lock is acquired.

CVE-2005-3275

    An error in the NAT code allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption) by causing two packets for the same
    protocol to be NATed at the same time, which leads to memory
    corruption.

CVE-2005-3276

    A missing memory cleanup in the thread handling routines before
    copying data into userspace allows a user process to obtain
    sensitive information.

This update also contains a number of corrections for issues that
turned out to have no security implication afterwards.

The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:

* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

A Denial of Service vulnerability was discovered in the

sys\_set\_mempolicy() function. By calling the function with a negative

first argument, a local attacker could cause a kernel crash.

(CAN-2005-3053)

A race condition was discovered in the handling of shared memory

mappings with CLONE\_VM. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a

deadlock (Denial of Service) by triggering a core dump while waiting

for a thread which had just performed an exec() system call.

(CAN-2005-3106)

A race condition was found in the handling of traced processes. When

one thread was tracing another thread that shared the same memory map,

a local attacker could trigger a deadlock (Denial of Service) by

forcing a core dump when the traced thread was in the TASK\_TRACED

state. (CAN-2005-3107)

A vulnerability has been found in the "ioremap" module. By performing

certain IO mapping operations, a local attacker could either read

memory pages he has not normally access to (information leak) or cause

a kernel crash (Denial of Service). This only affects the amd64

platform. (CAN-2005-3108)

The HFS and HFS+ file system drivers did not properly verify that the

file system that was attempted to be mounted really was HFS/HFS+. On

machines which allow users to mount arbitrary removable devices as HFS

or HFS+ with an /etc/fstab entry, this could be exploited to trigger a

kernel crash. (CAN-2005-3109)

Steve Herrel discovered a race condition in the "ebtables" netfilter

module. A remote attacker could exploit this by sending specially

crafted packets that caused a value to be modified after it had

been read but before it had been locked. This eventually lead to a

kernel crash. This only affects multiprocessor machines (SMP).

(CAN-2005-3110)

Robert Derr discovered a memory leak in the system call auditing code.

On a kernel which has the CONFIG\_AUDITSYSCALL option enabled, this

leads to memory exhaustion and eventually a Denial of Service. A local

attacker could also speed this up by excessively calling system calls.

This only affects customized kernels built from the kernel source

packages. The standard Ubuntu kernel does not have the

CONFIG\_AUDITSYSCALL option enabled, and is therefore not affected by

this.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
