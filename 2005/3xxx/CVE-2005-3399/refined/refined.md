The provided content describes a vulnerability affecting multiple anti-virus software vendors.

*   **Vulnerability:** Anti-virus software can be evaded by forging the "magic byte" (file header).
*   **Root Cause:** The scanning engine's file type determination routine is flawed. By prepending the "MZ" magic byte (characteristic of EXE files) to file types like .BAT, .HTML, and .EML, the anti-virus programs fail to correctly identify and scan the file, thus failing to detect malicious content.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass anti-virus detection, potentially allowing malware to infect systems.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker prepends the EXE magic byte (MZ) to a malicious file (e.g., a .BAT, .HTML, or .EML file). The modified file is then distributed to a target. When the target's anti-virus software scans the file, it misidentifies the file type and fails to detect the malicious content.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to modify files and distribute them to potential victims.
*   **Affected Vendors/Software:** ArcaVir, AVG, eTrust CA, Dr.Web, F-Prot, Ikarus, Kaspersky, McAfee, Norman, TrendMicro, Panda Titanium, UNA, Sophos, CAT-QuickHeal, Fortinet, TheHacker.
*   **Mitigation:** The vendor suggests patching the vulnerable scanning engine.
