Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2005-3646:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL injection**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing sanitization of the session ID cookie.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-controlled input (session ID cookie) before using it in a SQL query. This lack of input validation is the core vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Database access: Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   System access: Depending on the database user's permissions, an attacker might gain access to the local filesystem.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote. The attacker exploits the vulnerability via an HTTP request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the session ID cookie.

**Vulnerability 2: HTTP response splitting**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple instances of missing sanitization when writing HTTP headers.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate input before using it to construct HTTP response headers, allowing the attacker to inject malicious header data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application admin access: Attackers can potentially gain access to the application's administration interface, especially through the adclick.php vulnerability, which doesn't require prior access.
*  **Attack Vector:** Remote. This vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the request parameters used to build the HTTP headers.

**Vulnerability 3: Full path disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing sanitization in the application when handling file paths.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to prevent the disclosure of full file paths on the server. Additionally, it can expose information about files added or modified through the application's file integrity check system.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure. Attackers can discover the full path of files within the application, and potentially learn about the modified or added files by the system administrator, if the webserver user has sufficient permissions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote. Exploitable via an HTTP request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities are present in phpAdsNew and phpPgAds versions 2.0.6 and earlier.
*   The fix is to upgrade to version 2.0.7 or later.
*   The advisory is identified as `PHPADSNEW-SA-2005-002`.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by Toni Koivunen, and further SQL injection exploitation techniques were provided by Kevin Fernandez "Siegfried" of Zone-H.
