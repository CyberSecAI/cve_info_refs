The provided content relates to CVE-2005-3208.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the improper validation of user-supplied input in multiple scripts of Aenovo, AenovoShop, and aeNovoWYSI products. This lack of validation allows for SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Additionally, the applications store passwords in clear text, leading to a severe compromise of confidentiality.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Multiple scripts within the products are vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `password` parameter in `/password/default.asp` and `/user/control.asp`, and the `strSQL` parameter in `/search.asp` and `/incs/searchdisplay.asp` are vulnerable.
    *   **Clear Text Password Storage:** The application stores passwords in clear text in the `control`, `content`, and `pages` database tables.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Numerous active server pages are vulnerable to XSS attacks due to improper handling of user-supplied input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially allowing them to bypass login restrictions, gain unauthorized access to the database, retrieve sensitive information, and potentially modify data. As demonstrated in the provided proof-of-concept, attackers could list username and password of administrators.
    *   **Clear Text Password Storage:** An attacker with access to the database can easily retrieve user passwords, leading to account compromise.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML or scripts into vulnerable pages, which could then be executed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting the SQL injection vulnerabilities requires sending specially crafted parameters via HTTP requests to vulnerable scripts.
    *   **Clear Text Password Storage:** This vulnerability is exploited through direct access to the database or files.
    *    **XSS:** Exploiting XSS vulnerabilities requires sending malicious scripts or HTML through parameters which are then rendered on web pages.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   For SQL injection and XSS, the attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   For Clear Text Password Storage, the attacker would need unauthorized access to the database or the database files.
