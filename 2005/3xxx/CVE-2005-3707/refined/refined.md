  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2005-3707",
    "description": "Multiple types of overflow vulnerabilities exist in the way QuickTime handles files in the Targa (TGA) image file format. A specially crafted TGA image can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code of their choosing with the privileges of the user running QuickTime or cause a denial of service. Apple's advisory on this issue states that a buffer overflow, integer overflow, or integer underflow error could be exploited by such a crafted image.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of Targa (TGA) image files leading to buffer overflow, integer overflow or integer underflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Integer Underflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A maliciously crafted TGA image file (.tga or .targa) can be supplied to a user through a webpage, email, or other means designed to invoke QuickTime.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious TGA file to a victim."
