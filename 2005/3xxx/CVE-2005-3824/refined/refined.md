        "Code Execution: The 'templatename' parameter allows remote code execution using eval() with unvalidated input, and combined with file upload, allowing execution of uploaded files.",
        "Arbitrary File Upload: Ability to upload any file type, including PHP files, via the 'add2db' action, leading to arbitrary code execution."
