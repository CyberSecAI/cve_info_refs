    {
      "cve": "CVE-2005-3178",
      "description": "Multiple buffer overflows in xloadimage when handling the image title name of NIFF images. The 'zoom', 'reduce', and 'rotate' functions use a fixed-length buffer to construct the new title name. Since the title name in a NIFF format is of varying length and there are insufficient buffer size validations, the buffer can be overflowed.",
      "root_cause": "Insufficient buffer size validation when processing NIFF image titles during image manipulation operations like zoom, reduce, and rotate.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious user can construct a NIFF file that, when viewed and processed by xloadimage (using zoom, reduce, or rotate), will overwrite the return address and execute arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious user provides a specially crafted NIFF image file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious NIFF file. The attacker needs a user to process the malicious NIFF file using vulnerable `xloadimage` functionality (zoom, rotate, reduce).  This can occur by a user directly opening a file or processing it with the specified flags.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the `zoom.c`, `reduce.c`, and `rotate.c` files where fixed size buffers (8192 bytes) are used to construct new title names, leading to potential overflows. Some systems may have address space randomization enabled, which can cause crashes instead of arbitrary code execution but it's possible to execute code with a large enough NIFF file."
