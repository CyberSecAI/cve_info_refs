How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi,

While creating a stripped down version of xloadimage, I have discovered
three buffer overflows in xloadimage when handling the image title name.

Unlike most of the supported image formats in xloadimage, the NIFF image
format can store a title name of arbitrary length as part of the image file.

When xloadimage is processing a loaded image, it is creating a new Image
object and then writing the processed image to it. At that point, it will
also copy the title from the old image to the newly created image.

The 'zoom', 'reduce', and 'rotate' functions are using a fixed length buffer
to construct the new title name when an image processing is done. Since the
title name in a NIFF format is of varying length, and there are insufficient
buffer size validations, the buffer can be overflowed.

A malicious user can construct a NIFF file that when viewed and processed
(with either zoom, reduce or rotate) by xloadimage, will cause the program
to overwrite the return address and execute arbitrary code.

Proof of concept for the 'zoom' image processing bug, tested on a x86
computer running Gentoo Linux:

emerge xloadimage
xloadimage -zoom 20 small.niff			(small.niff is attached)

This will execute '/bin/sh'.

Note: some systems may have the (/proc/sys/kernel/)randomize_va_space option
enabled, which will cause the program to crash instead of executing /bin/sh
in most cases. Using a larger NIFF file (large.niff.gz [800KB unzipped]), it
is possible to execute arbitrary code even when the random address space
option is enabled (with about 33% success rate).

The 'reduce' and 'rotate' bugs are similar, but require a slightly different
NIFF file and different ( processing options.

The bugs are in :

zoom.c, zoom() writes an arbitrarily large buffer into a 8192 bytes sized
buffer buf[].

reduce.c, reduce() writes an arbitrarily large buffer into a 8192 bytes
sized buffer buf[].

rotate.c, rotate() writes an arbitrarily large buffer into a 8192 bytes
sized buffer buf[].

The bugs discussed above exist in the latest xloadimage package that Gentoo
provides (xloadimage.4.1-r3), and the latest xloadimage source package from
debian I could find (xloadimage_4.1-14.2). I haven't tested xloadimage
packages from other sources.

I emailed jimf@centerline.com (the contact information on the help page)
more than two weeks ago, but since I've recieved no reply, I am announcing
it here.

Thanks,
Ariel Berkman.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# XLI, Xloadimage: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200510-26**

XLI and Xloadimage contain a vulnerability which could potentially result
in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/xli** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.17.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.17.0-r2** |

| Package | **media-gfx/xloadimage** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.1-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.1-r4** |

### Background

XLI and Xloadimage are X11 image manipulation utilities.

### Description

When XLI or Xloadimage process an image, they create a new image
object to contain the new image, copying the title from the old image
to the newly created image. Ariel Berkman reported that the 'zoom',
'reduce', and 'rotate' functions use a fixed length buffer to contain
the new title, which could be overwritten by the NIFF or XPM image
processors.

### Impact

A malicious user could craft a malicious XPM or NIFF file and
entice a user to view it using XLI, or manipulate it using Xloadimage,
potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running XLI or Xloadimage.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All XLI users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/xli-1.17.0-r2"
```

All Xloadimage users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/xloadimage-4.1-r4"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 859-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
October 10th, 2005                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : xli
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-3178
Debian Bug     : 332524

Ariel Berkman discovered several buffer overflows in xloadimage, which
are also present in xli, a command line utility for viewing images in
X11, and could be exploited via large image titles and cause the
execution of arbitrary code.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.0-11woody2.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.0-18sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your xli package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

xloadimage security update (RHSA-2005-802)

Original Release Date: January 16, 2006

Last Revised: February 17, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-013

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The xloadimage utility displays images in an X Window System window, loads
images into the root window, or writes images into a file. Xloadimage
supports many image types (including GIF, TIFF, JPEG, XPM, and XBM).

A flaw was discovered in xloadimage via which an attacker can construct a
NIFF image with a very long embedded image title. This image can cause a
buffer overflow. Several Avaya System products ship with xloadimage installed.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CAN-2005-3178](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-3178) to this issue.

More information about this vulnerability can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-802.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with xloadimage installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  An update is being considered for a future release. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  An update is being considered for a future release. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  An update is being considered for a future release. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of xloadimage, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can be
installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected
by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | all | Low | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. Red Hat)

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account
