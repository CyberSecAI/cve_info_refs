The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the Zyxel P2000W v.1 VOIP WIFI phone:

**A. Vulnerability Title: Zyxel P2000W v.1 VOIP WIFI Phone undocumented port UDP/9090**

*   **Root Cause:** The phone has an undocumented UDP port 9090 open.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** An unauthenticated attacker can connect to UDP port 9090 and retrieve information about the phone, such as its MAC address and software version.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can easily identify the phone and its software version.
    *   The open port may provide an avenue for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network access to the phone.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the phone on port 9090. No authentication is required.

**B. Vulnerability Title: Zyxel P2000W v.1 VOIP WIFI Phone uses hardcoded DNS servers**

*   **Root Cause:** The phone uses hardcoded DNS servers located in Taiwan.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The phone's DNS configuration is hardcoded to use specific DNS servers (168.95.1.1 and 139.175.55.244).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Unintentional DoS if the hardcoded DNS servers in Taiwan become unavailable.
    *   If the hardcoded DNS servers are compromised, users can be redirected to malicious SIP servers.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network based attacks compromising the hardcoded DNS servers.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  Attackers must be able to control or compromise the DNS servers used by the phone.
