{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation within the racoon daemon of ipsec-tools.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The racoon daemon attempts to dereference a NULL pointer under specific conditions.",
       "The vulnerability can only be triggered by having a very weak configuration."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending crafted ISAKMP Phase 1 packets to a vulnerable racoon daemon. This causes the daemon to crash, preventing it from establishing or maintaining IPsec connections.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation by sending specifically crafted IKEv1 packets.",
      "The attack requires a vulnerable system using a weak configuration."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target system running the vulnerable racoon daemon."
  }
