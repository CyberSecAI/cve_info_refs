  "CVE-2005-3357": {
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw in mod_ssl was discovered affecting server configurations where an SSL virtual host is configured with access control and a custom 400 error document. A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request to trigger this issue which would lead to a crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the non-default worker MPM.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the `ssl_hook_Access` function being called during error handling when `ssl` is NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can crash the server by sending a specially crafted request to an SSL-enabled virtual host that has a custom 400 error page configured. This results in a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote, specially crafted request to an SSL-enabled port"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted request to a server with a specific configuration: an SSL virtual host, access control, and a custom 400 error document.",
      "vulnerable_configurations":[
       "Apache httpd 2.x with mod_ssl enabled, using a threaded MPM (like worker)",
       "SSL vhost configured with access control",
       "Custom 400 ErrorDocument is used"
      ]
