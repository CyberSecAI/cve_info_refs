The provided content describes a vulnerability related to antivirus detection bypass using specially crafted archive files, specifically RAR and CAB formats. This is not directly related to CVE-2005-3228 which is a placeholder.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the ability to create archive files (RAR and CAB) that can evade detection by certain antivirus software during the scanning phase, before extraction. The specific techniques used to craft these archives are not detailed in the content, but the report shows that different archives can bypass different AV engines.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The weakness is in the antivirus software's inability to properly analyze and detect malicious content within these specially crafted archives. This is not an archive vulnerability but an AV scanning one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can deliver a malicious payload disguised within the crafted archive file. The impact is that the malware bypasses antivirus detection, potentially leading to infection when the user extracts the malicious files. The malicious content only poses a risk after extraction.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is the distribution of crafted archive files (RAR and CAB) containing malicious content that is not detected by the antivirus software. This could be through any means of file transfer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs the ability to create specific archive formats (RAR or CAB) which bypass AV detection and distribute them. The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position for exploitation once the file has been delivered. The attacker requires an understanding of how AV scanners work.

The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, outlining a specific case of antivirus evasion with crafted archive files and showing AV detection results.
