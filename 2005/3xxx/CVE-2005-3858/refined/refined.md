```
Root cause of vulnerability: A memory leak exists in the ip6_input_finish() function within the IPv6 code.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper memory management leading to a memory leak.
Impact of exploitation: Denial of service due to excessive memory consumption.
Attack vectors: Network traffic targeting the vulnerable IPv6 code path.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to send network traffic that triggers the vulnerable function.
