The content discusses a bug in Internet Explorer that causes a denial-of-service (DoS) condition in Mozilla and Safari.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bug in Internet Explorer (details not provided) triggers a resource exhaustion issue in other browsers like Mozilla and Safari.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is resource exhaustion leading to a DoS condition. The specific flaw in IE is not detailed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is a denial-of-service. Mozilla crashes or becomes unusable, and Safari becomes unusable and slows down the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a web page that exploits the IE bug. Browsing to the malicious page triggers the denial of service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious web page that exploits the Internet Explorer bug. A user browsing to this page is then vulnerable.
