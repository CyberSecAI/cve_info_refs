# SecLists.Org Security Mailing List Archive

Any hacker will tell you that the latest news and exploits are not
found on any web site—not even [Insecure.Org](https://insecure.org). No, the cutting edge
in security research is and will continue to be the full
disclosure mailing lists such as Bugtraq. Here we provide web
archives and RSS feeds (now including message extracts), updated in real-time, for many of our favorite lists.
Browse the individual lists below, or search them all using the Site Search box above.

**[Full Disclosure](/fulldisclosure/)** — A public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. The relaxed atmosphere of this quirky list provides some comic relief and certain industry gossip. More importantly, fresh vulnerabilities sometimes hit this list many hours or days before they pass through the Bugtraq moderation queue.

## Other Excellent Security Lists

[![bugtraq logo](/images/bugtraq-logo.png)](/bugtraq/)

**[Bugtraq](/bugtraq/)** — The premier general security mailing list. Vulnerabilities are often announced here first, so check frequently!

[![basics logo](/images/basics-logo.png)](/basics/)

**[Security Basics](/basics/)** — A high-volume list which permits people to ask "stupid questions" without being derided as "n00bs". I recommend this list to network security newbies, but be sure to read Bugtraq and other lists as well.

**[Daily Dave](/dailydave/)** — This technical discussion list covers vulnerability research, exploit development, and security events/gossip. It was started by [ImmunitySec](http://www.immunitysec.com/) founder Dave Aitel and many security luminaries participate. Many posts simply advertise Immunity products, but you can't really fault Dave for being self-promotional on a list named DailyDave.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
