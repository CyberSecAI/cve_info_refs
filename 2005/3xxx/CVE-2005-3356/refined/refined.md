{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The mq_open system call has error paths where mqueue_mnt->mnt_count is decremented twice.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double decrement of a reference counter in the mq_open system call"
    ],
    "impact": "The double decrement of mqueue_mnt->mnt_count leads to a premature cleanup of the associated structure, resulting in a kernel panic and a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user execution of a program that triggers the flawed mq_open system call."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Any local user can trigger this vulnerability."
