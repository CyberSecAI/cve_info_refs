Subject: twiki: INCLUDE function allows arbitrary shell command execution
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 2005 11:28:23 -0400
```
Package: twiki
Version: 20040902-3
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

A new security bug in twiki showed up today:
<http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/SecurityAlertExecuteCommandsWithInclude>

An attacker is able to execute arbitrary shell commands with the
privileges of the web server process. The TWiki INCLUDE function
enables a malicious user to compose a command line executed by the
Perl backtick (`) operator.

The rev parameter of the INCLUDE variable is not checked properly for
shell metacharacters and is thus vulnerable to revision numbers
containing pipes and shell commands. The exploit is possible on
included topics with two or more revisions.

Example INCLUDE variable exploiting the rev parameter:
%INCLUDE{ "Main.TWikiUsers" rev="2|less /etc/passwd" }%

The same vulnerability is exposed to all Plugins and add-ons that use
TWiki::Func::readTopicText function to read a previous topic revision.
This has been tested on TWiki:Plugins.RevCommentPlugin and
TWiki:Plugins.CompareRevisionsAddon.

If access to TWiki is not restricted by other means, attackers can use
the revision function with or without prior authentication, depending
on the configuration.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CAN-2005-3056 to this vulnerability. Please include this number in any
changelogs fixing this.

excellent.

Micah, did you manage to reproduce this in the debian package at all?

you see, the debian package is significantly more secure than the
upstream version, and as you've marked it as grave, I presume that you
have found a way to make it happen. (as when I had a go, i did not get
the exploit (i got a unhelpful, but correct error message "invalid
number argument at /usr/share/perl5/TWiki.pm line 3339.")

could you please either tell me how to reproduce the problem in the
current debian package, or close it?

Cheers

Sven

Sven,

I have not attempted to reproduce this in the debian package, I'm
tracking known vulnerabilities with the testing-security team. When I
see a new CVE id assigned to a package and no bugs filed on that package
regarding that CVE, and no entries in the changelogs noting that it has
been fixed, I tend to believe that it hasn't been because it is a rare
package maintainer who has security issues fixed before they are
discovered or announced.

Additionally, the advisory indicates that the version in debian
(20040902-3) is affected, as the only versions it indicates are safe is
the TWikiRelease01Sep2004 patched with Florian Weimer's
UncoordinatedSecurityAlert23Feb2005 patches. Without any indication in
the BTS or in changelogs, I assume that the package is affected because
the version numbers typically are very good indicators. Admittedly, you
could very well have addressed this issue, and I have a feeling that you
have as Florian is very active in Debian. If so, I'd be happy to know
that, and we can close this bug, so I can note it in the
testing-security database.

Unfortunately, if I had to try every exploit, even those without
published exploits, for every CVE assigned, there would be a net loss. I
understand that this means this is an annoyance to you to get a grave
bug report for something that you may have addressed, however it ends up
being a good thing because then we know for sure, and can better track
vulnerabilities in Debian. It is better to be asked once if this is an
issue and have it properly noted, than for Debian to not pay attention
to anything at all and be riddled with security holes.

while I think its very reasonable for you to send along these
advisories, and even doing so as a BTS bug wothout testing them

I think its incredibly rude to do so without saying that you have not
tested it out.

please, if you enter a bug report, tell the maintainer what you have or
have not done, that way they can deal more appropriatly with the issue

(in the cases where the core issue has been dealt with (thanks to
Florian!) I'm very busy helping out upstream, and i'm sure this
situation _should_ apply to others (i object to the number of debian
maintainers that are not appropriatly active upstream)

however, other than my rant :) thanks for the notification, its
important (i'm still notifying people now)

Does this mean that the twiki (20040902-3) in Debian is not vulnerable
and this bug report can be closed?

Yes, defiantly

I have not found any way to exploit the debian package using any thus
far found methods. Florians patch get in the way every time :)
