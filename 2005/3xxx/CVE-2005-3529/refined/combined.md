GPG key: http://moritz-naumann.com/keys/0x277F060C.asc
AFFECTED APPLICATION OR SERVICE
TikiWiki
http://tikiwiki.org/
AFFECTED VERSION
1.9.x up to and including 1.9.2
Possibly versions < 1.9 (untested)
BACKGROUND
"Tikiwiki is a full featured Free Software (GNU/LGPL)
Wiki/CMS/Groupware written in PHP and maintained by an
active and international community of benevolent
contributors."
ISSUE 1 (XSS)
A XSS vulnerability has been detected in the fora code
of TikiWiki. The problem is caused by insufficient input
sanitation.
The following partial URL demonstrates the issue:
[baseURL]/tiki-view\_forum\_thread.php?forumId=1&comments\_parentId=0&topic
s\_offset=10%22%20onmouseover='javascript:alert(document.title)%3B'%3E[PL
EASE%20MOVE%20YOUR%20MOUSE%20POINTER%20HERE!]%20%3Cx%20y=%22
Please move your mouse pointer over the input field
which says so.
ISSUE 2 (Information Disclosure, possible SQL injection)
The application discloses the installation path. This
\*may\* also be useable to craft an SQL injection.
The following partial URL demonstrates the issue:
[baseURL]/tiki-view\_forum\_thread.php?forumId=1&comments\_parentId=0&topic
s\_sort\_mode=FOOBAH
WORKAROUND
Issue 1: Disable Javascript (client) or deny access to
TikiWiki (server).
Issue 2: Set PHP to log errors to file only (issue 2).
SOLUTIONS
We are not aware of a maintainer provided fix.
TIMELINE
Oct 6, 2005: Maintainer informed
Oct 6, 2005: First maintainer reply
Oct 14, 2005: Request for additional information sent
to maintainer
[in between]: issues fixed on maintainer website

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
