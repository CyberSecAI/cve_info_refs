Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2005-3545

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `ibProArcade` module. Specifically, the `user` parameter within the `report` module is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input within the `user` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data in the database, such as user passwords, by exploiting the SQL injection flaw to extract data beyond what is normally intended.
-  **Integrity Impact:** While not explicitly mentioned, it is implied that the attacker can modify/delete data.
-  **Availability Impact:** While not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that availability could be affected through data modification and/or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via HTTP request.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `user` parameter in the `report` module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to understand SQL and how to craft SQL injection payloads.
- The attacker must know or guess the column names of sensitive information such as passwords.

**Specifics:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of ibProArcade 2.x.
- The vulnerability has been tested and found working in conjunction with vBulletin and Invision Power Board forums.
- Examples of the SQL injection exploit are given for both vBulletin and Invision Power Board.

**Example Payloads:**
- **Invision Power Board (IPB):** `index.php?act=Arcade&module=report&user=-1 union select password from ibf_members where id=[any_user]`
- **vBulletin:** `index.php?act=ibProArcade&module=report&user=-1 union select password from user where userid=[any_user]`
