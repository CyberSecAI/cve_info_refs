phpBB 2.0.17 (and other BB systems as well) Cookie disclosure exploit.

I sent the report to phpBB and they said that a patch will be available withing a few \
days and It will be integrated into 2.0.18 .

Note: This works like XSS, and requires the victim to use IE (Affects all versions of \
IE).

Special Credits to: Sven Vetsch (the original finder of "The gif bug").
The original gif-bug article : \
<http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/6F00B00EBY.html> Also thanks to the experts \
at securiteam.com for clarifying some issues.

Since what is described in the original article doesn't work, I have written this \
step-by-step article explaining how to replicate this bug successfuly.

Affected: All phpBB systems allowing "Upload Avatar from URL" and most likely all \
other systems with such a feature (Other bulletin boards - but I didn't check).

Well, the base for the problem lies within IE.. The core element of my Proof of \
Concept is the lately found Gif-bug in IE (Originally found by Sven Vetsch).

For some reason IE renders malformed embedded content files (like gif,jpg,wav,and so \
on..) as HTML when they are accessed directly e.g. <http://attacker.com/xss.gif> (Not \
through the <img> tag).

If we create an HTML file and rename its extention to .GIF (or other embedded content \
file extention), and upload it to an HTTP server (it dosn't work locally for some \
reason), when we will navigate to <http://myserver.com/xss.gif> the HTML code will be \
executed instead of showing that the image is invalid.

So, if we could upload such a file to a server that allows image upload we could \
actually upload HTML code instead (Inside the image file). If the victim will be \
lured to navigate to this  specially crafted image in IE, arbitary HTML code could be \
executed in the servers security zone, e.g. we could steall the users cookie, for \
example.

However it is not that simple with systems (like phpBB) that verify the image file \
before it is uploaded to the server. If we try to upload our previosly made \
<http://attacker.com/xss.gif> gif file the system will complain about incorrect image \
size - that's because our image is invalid. The verification system chechs the files \
header. In a valid 1x1 gif file the header should be (in hex) : 47 49 46 38 39 61 01 \
00 01 00 . After the header we will insert the next HTML code: \
<HTML><HEAD><SCRIPT>alert(document.cookie);</SCRIPT></HEAD></HTML> So the file will \
look like this (in hex): 47 49 46 38 39 61 01 00 01 00 3C 48 54 4D 4C 3E 3C 48 45 41 \
44 3E 3C 53 43 52 49 50 54 3E 61 6C 65

72 74 28 64 6F 63 75 6D 65 6E 74 2E 63 6F 6F 6B 69 65 29 3B 3C 2F 53 43 52 49 50 54 \
3E 3C 2F 48 45

41 44 3E 3C 2F 48 54 4D 4C 3E

If we upload this file instead the old one to : <http://myserver.com/xss.gif> we will \
be able to upload it as a phpBB avatar. However when we access the file directly (as \
before) no HTML code is going to be executed. That is because IE sees the valid \
header and tries to draw the image  instead of rendering the HTML (and fails anyway \
...).

However if we change the file extention from .GIF to .JPG the GIF header in the \
beginning will become meaningless to IE and the HTML code will be executed. So if we \
rename our image from  xss.gif to xss.jpg when we will navigate to \
<http://myserver.com/xss.jpg> we will see an alert box (that should show the cookie on \
its current server).

The phpBB avatar upload system verifies the files header - and our header is pretty \
much valid - for a GIF file, but not JPG. If we try to upload the file \
<http://myserver.com/xss.jpg> as our avatar it will be successfuly uploaded. Hence any \
one who will navigate (in IE) directly to our avatar in

its new address on the phpBB forum server (the URL should look like \
<http://phpbbforum.com/phpbb/>

images/avatars/2131121a2121f.jpg) will be able to see his cookie information in an \
alert window. Instead an image something like GIF89a_--. will apear, but it can be \
easily obfuscated with a simple JavaScript.

As a Proof of Concept here is a ready made JPG file: (Save target as) \
<http://planet.nana.co.il/>

mycoolpictures123/fake/lt2.jpg . Upload this (from its current location, or your HTTP \
server) as an avatar to phpBB (or as I believe - any Bulletin Board system). In your \
avatar an invalid image (red X) will appear, but when you navigate to it's current \
location (e.g. <http://phpbbforum.com/>

phpbb/images/avatars/2131121a2121f.jpg) you will see an alert with your cookie.

Using the basic idea of my PoC, the code can be manipulated to send a users cookie \
information to  a CGI sniffer on a remote server. All that should be done is sending \
a message saying "Check out this image" and specifying the avatars URL.

This is a major problem since 90% of the internet users use IE and lots of dynamic \
sites (like  bulletin boards) allow image upload to the server.

The solution could come in many ways. The best solution for the user is to use \
another browser (like FireFox) untill a vendor patch from Micrsoft is available. For \
bulletin board administrators it is highly advised to turn off the "Upload avatar \
from URL" option untill a patch from the vendor (phpBB, vBulletin, IPB, and so on...) \
arrives.

Have a good day.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpBB, a fully
featured and skinnable flat webforum,

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2005-3310

    Multiple interpretation errors allow remote authenticated users to
    inject arbitrary web script when remote avatars and avatar
    uploading are enabled.

    phpBB allows remote attackers to bypass security checks when
    register_globals is enabled and the session_start function has not
    been called to handle a session.

CVE-2005-3417

    phpBB allows remote attackers to modify global variables and
    bypass security mechanisms.

CVE-2005-3418

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts.

CVE-2005-3419

    An SQL injection vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2005-3420
