Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE-2005-3310:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer (IE) handles malformed embedded content files (like GIFs, JPGs). When these files are accessed directly (not through an `<img>` tag), IE incorrectly renders them as HTML. This is triggered by a vulnerability in IE's rendering engine.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  The core vulnerability lies in the ability to upload a file with a valid image header (e.g., GIF) but containing malicious HTML code in the file body, then tricking IE into rendering this as HTML code by changing the file extension to another type(e.g., JPG).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  By exploiting this, an attacker could inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript code, into the security zone of the server hosting the file (e.g. where the image is hosted). This allows for actions such as stealing user cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves:
    1.  Creating a malicious file: Start with a valid image file header, followed by HTML/JavaScript code.
    2.  Uploading the file: Upload this file to a server that allows image uploads (like a forum avatar system).
    3.  Changing the file extention: The file extention is changed to a type that triggers the IE behavior(e.g., JPG).
    4.  Luring the victim: Tricking the victim to directly navigate to the uploaded image through IE.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs a system or application that allows uploading of files.
    *   They need to be able to modify the file extention of the uploaded file (or trick the application into doing so).
    *   The attacker must trick the victim into accessing the malformed URL directly using Internet Explorer.
*   **Specifics to phpBB:** The vulnerability is present in phpBB when "Upload avatar from URL" is enabled. The attacker uploads the malicious file via the avatar upload functionality. The server verifies the file header for a valid image format, but fails to prevent the execution of the malicious HTML code.
*   **More Details than CVE Description:** The provided content provides much more detail than a typical CVE description, including step-by-step instructions on how to exploit the vulnerability, the specific file header manipulation, and the IE-specific behavior triggering the issue. It also highlights the necessity to change the extension of the file after uploading.

The content also mentions the issue is present in other bulletin board systems with similar functionality, indicating the vulnerability is not solely limited to phpBB. The content also describes how to steal a user's cookie through this vulnerability.
