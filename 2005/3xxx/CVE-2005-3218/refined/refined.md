Based on the provided content, this vulnerability is related to bypassing antivirus detection using specially crafted archive files.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the ability to create specially crafted archive files (RAR and CAB formats) that can evade detection by some antivirus software. These archives contain malicious payloads (e.g., the EICAR test file), which are not detected until the archive is extracted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Antivirus software's inability to detect malicious payloads within specific types of crafted archive files.
- Some archive extraction tools (WinRAR and PowerZip) will open and extract the archive, even if it is crafted in a way that some AV software will not scan it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass antivirus detection.
- Malicious payloads can be delivered to systems undetected.
- Once extracted, the malicious content can be detected by antivirus software.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending the specially crafted archive file to a victim via email or other means.
- The user needs to extract the archive file using vulnerable software (Winrar & PowerZip) to be exposed to the malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create specially crafted archive files.
- Ability to deliver the archive to the target system.
