Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1000144

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `photoxhibit` WordPress plugin where the `gid` parameter obtained from the URL query string using `$_GET['gid']` is directly echoed back into the HTML output without proper sanitization. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the lack of input sanitization when processing the `gid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacement of the webpage
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes a malicious JavaScript payload in the `gid` parameter.
- The vulnerable code is in `/photoxhibit/common/inc/pages/edit_styles.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `gid`.
- An attacker can lure a victim to visit the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL with an XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to entice or trick a user of the WordPress site to visit this crafted URL.
