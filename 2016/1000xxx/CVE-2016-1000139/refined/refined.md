Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `leadscoring.php` file of the Infusionsoft Gravity Forms Add-on plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the `ContactId` parameter is directly echoed back into the HTML without any encoding or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Stealing sensitive information like cookies and authentication tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious script within the `ContactId` parameter.
    *   `http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/infusionsoft/Infusionsoft/examples/leadscoring.php?ContactId="><script>alert(1);</script><"`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious JavaScript and trick a user into visiting the vulnerable URL. This could be done via:
    *   Social engineering (e.g. sending a malicious link via email)
    *   Compromising another website to redirect the user.

**Additional Information:**

*   The plugin version affected is 1.5.11.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.5.12.
*   The plugin has been closed as of October 1, 2021, due to guideline violation and is not available for download.
