### [Plugin No Longer Works For New Forms](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-no-longer-works-for-new-forms/)

Last year, I knew I was dealing with a ticking time bomb for a plugin that hasn’t been updated in over four years, and now the bomb has gone off. This plugin no longer works for any new forms that are created. It just spins.
Game over. Wordpress should remove this plugin from its directory, because clearly the developer has abandoned it and NO ONE should waste any time installing and activating this plugin until it is updated.

I’ve been using this plugin for 4 years on multiple websites. Works great but I just wish the developer would release updates to improve the interface and functionality.
Thank you!

We use it all the time to connect Gravity Forms to Infusionsoft. The only wish I had was that the Entry Tag’s field was wider.

A brilliant plugin when it worked – but it hasn’t been updated in ages – and now produces errors when submitting forms on iOS or OS X Safari. Time out issues.. This unfortunately makes the form unusable. Shame.

It seems to work on PHP 5.6 and below as an interim fix
