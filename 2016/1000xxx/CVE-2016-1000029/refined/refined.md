Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within the Tenable Nessus user interface. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script that is stored by the application and later executed in the browsers of other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before storing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The XSS vulnerability requires admin-level authentication to exploit and potentially impact other admins.
- Successful exploitation would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers who access the Nessus interface, leading to actions being performed on behalf of those users or exfiltration of information.
- The impact would be limited to other admin users due to the required privileges for exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious script through the Nessus UI using a feature accessible to admin-level users.
- The injected script is stored by the application and then executed when a different admin user views the content containing the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have admin-level access to the Nessus UI to inject the malicious script.
- They also need another admin user to load the page/content containing the malicious payload to trigger the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Tenable Nessus versions before 6.8.
- Tenable IDs associated with this CVE are 5218 and 5269.
- The provided content indicates that this issue has been addressed in Nessus version 6.8 and that the XSS vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 4.8 (Medium) and a CVSS v2 score of 3.5 (Low), according to the provided data.
- The same vulnerability report also details CVE-2016-1000028 which is another stored XSS issue requiring admin level access but with a different Tenable ID and that it may only affect other admins.
- It also mentions CVE-2016-0718 which is a buffer overflow within the Expat XML parser with a high severity, also fixed in version 6.8.
