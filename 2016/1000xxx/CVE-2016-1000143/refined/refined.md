Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1000143

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `$_GET['gid']` parameter. This unsanitized data is then directly echoed back into the HTML context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application takes input from a request (`gid` parameter) and reflects it back to the user's browser without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access a crafted URL.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal user session cookies and potentially take over the user's account
*   **Defacement:** The attacker can modify the content of the page visible to the victim.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites or trigger downloads of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the payload within the `gid` parameter, and then tricks the victim into clicking the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a user of the affected WordPress site.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the server.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in `./photoxhibit/common/inc/pages/build.php` within the PhotoXhibit plugin. Specifically, the following lines of code are affected:
```php
<a class="editLinks" href="admin.php?page=px_manage&amp;action=edit_styles&amp;gid=<?php echo $_GET['gid'];?>"><?php _e('Edit Styles', 'photoxhibit'); ?></a>
<a class="editLinks" href="admin.php?page=px_manage&amp;action=edit_image_attr&amp;gid=<?php echo $_GET['gid'];?>"><?php _e('Edit Images', 'photoxhibit'); ?></a>
<input type="hidden" id="px_gidHidden" name="px_gidHidden" value="<?php echo $_GET['gid'];?>"/>
```
These lines directly echo the value of the `gid` GET parameter into the HTML without sanitizing it, enabling the XSS vulnerability.

**Exploit Code Example:**
```
http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/photoxhibit/common/inc/pages/build.php?gid="><script>alert(1);</script><"
```
This URL demonstrates how an attacker can inject a JavaScript alert box into the page.
