      "root_cause": "The Bouncy Castle JCE Provider versions through 1.55 do not fully validate the ASN.1 encoding of DSA signatures during verification. It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate.",

        "Improper validation of ASN.1 encoding of DSA signatures",
        "DSA signature generation vulnerable to timing attacks"
