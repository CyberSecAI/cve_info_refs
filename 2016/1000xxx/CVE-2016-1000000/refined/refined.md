Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1000000

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a blind SQL injection in the `WrFreeFormText.asp` script of Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 16.4.1. The `sUniqueID` parameter is appended to an SQL query and executed without proper sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The SQL injection is "visually impaired," meaning the attacker doesn't directly see the results of their queries. They must infer the results based on the server's response time or other indirect methods.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize the `sUniqueID` parameter before using it in the SQL query, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
- Privilege Escalation: Attackers can gain full user rights or modify user accounts, potentially leading to complete control of the application.
- Code Execution: Attackers can modify user names to inject Javascript code that would be executed when the user list is displayed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Request: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `WrFreeFormText.asp` script, including a malicious SQL payload in the `sUniqueID` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the WhatsUp Gold web interface.
- Ability to send HTTP requests with controlled parameters to the vulnerable application.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
