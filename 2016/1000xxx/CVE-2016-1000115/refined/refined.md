Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `id` variable passed via the HTTP request in the `administrator/components/com_portfoliogallery/models/portfoliogallery.php` file. This unsanitized variable is directly incorporated into an SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
*  **XSS:** The application echoes the `edit` parameter from the GET request into a textarea without proper sanitization. This makes it susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application constructs SQL queries using user-supplied data without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The application echoes user-controlled input to the web browser without proper sanitization/encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that could be executed within the victim's browser, potentially leading to cookie stealing, session hijacking, or website defacement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive database information, modify existing data, or even compromise the entire database server.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when viewing the vulnerable page, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal session cookies, or redirect the user to other malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL of the `administrator/index.php?option=com_portfoliogallery&view=portfoliogallery` request to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject a malicious script in the `edit` parameter of the URL when accessing `administrator/components/com_portfoliogallery/views/video/tmpl/default.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to have access to the administrative panel or at least manager-level access to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **XSS:** The attacker must be logged in with at least manager level access or access to the administrative panel to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides specific file paths and line numbers where the vulnerabilities are located, which is more detailed than a typical CVE description.
*   The advisory includes an example `sqlmap` command to demonstrate exploitation of the SQL injection.
