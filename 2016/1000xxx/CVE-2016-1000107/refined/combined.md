## A CGI application vulnerability (in 2016) for PHP, Go, Python and others

*httpoxy* is a set of vulnerabilities that affect application code running in CGI, or CGI-like environments. It comes
down to a simple namespace conflict:

* RFC 3875 (CGI) puts the HTTP `Proxy` header from a request into the environment variables as `HTTP_PROXY`
* `HTTP_PROXY` is a popular environment variable used to configure an outgoing proxy

This leads to a remotely exploitable vulnerability. If youâre running PHP or CGI, you should block the `Proxy` header.
[Hereâs how.](#fix-now)

httpoxy is a vulnerability for server-side web applications. If youâre not deploying code, you donât need to worry.

#### What can happen if my web application is vulnerable?

If a vulnerable HTTP client makes an outgoing HTTP connection, while running in a server-side CGI application, an
attacker may be able to:

* Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application
* Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing
* Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy

httpoxy is extremely easy to exploit in basic form. And we expect security
researchers to be able to scan for it quickly. Luckily, if you read on and
find you are affected, [easy mitigations](#fix-now) are available.

## Isnât this old news? Is this still a problem?

httpoxy **was disclosed in mid-2016**. If youâre reading about it now for the first time, you can *probably* relax and
take your time reading about this quaint historical bug that *hopefully* no longer affects any of the applications you
maintain. But you should verify that to your own satisfaction.

The content below this point reflects the original disclosure, and Iâll be leaving the site up and mostly unchanged, other
than noting fix versions where I can. I guess Iâm just saying: the time for urgency was last year.

## What Is Affected

A few things are necessary to be vulnerable:

* Code running under a CGI-like context, where `HTTP_PROXY` becomes a real or emulated environment variable
* An HTTP client that trusts `HTTP_PROXY`, and configures it as the proxy
* That client, used within a request handler, making an HTTP (as opposed to HTTPS) request

For example, the confirmed cases weâve found so far:

| Language | Environment | HTTP client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHP | php-fpm  mod\_php | Guzzle 4+  Artax |
| Python | wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler  twisted.web.twcgi.CGIScript | requests |
| Go | net/http/cgi | net/http |

But obviously there may be languages we havenât considered yet. CGI is a common standard, and
`HTTP_PROXY` seems to be becoming more popular over time. Take the below as a sample of the most
commonly affected scenarios:

### PHP

* Whether you are vulnerable depends on your specific application code and PHP libraries, but the problem
  seems fairly widespread
* Just *using* one of the vulnerable libraries, while processing a userâs request, is exploitable.
* If youâre using a vulnerable library, this vulnerability will affect any version of PHP
  + It even affects alternative PHP runtimes such as HHVM deployed under FastCGI
* It is present in Guzzle, Artax, and probably many, many libraries
  + Guzzle versions in the range `>=4.0.0rc2,<6.2.1` are vulnerable, Guzzle 3 and below is not.
  + Another example is (update: was) in Composerâs StreamContextBuilder utility class

So, for example, if you are using a Drupal module that uses Guzzle `6.2.0` and makes an outgoing HTTP request (for example,
to check a weather API), you are vulnerable to the request that plugin makes being âhttpoxiedâ.

### Python

* Python code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, thatâll mean the vulnerable code
  will use a CGI handler like `wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler`
  + This is not considered a normal way of deploying Python webapps (most people are using WSGI or FastCGI, both of which are
    not affected), so vulnerable Python applications will probably be much rarer than vulnerable PHP applications.
  + wsgi, for example, is not vulnerable, because os.environ is not polluted by CGI data
* Vulnerable versions of the requests library will trust and use `os.environ['HTTP_PROXY']`, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in `2.7.13`, `3.4.6`, `3.5.3`, `3.6.0` (see [the Python advisory](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/cve-2016-1000110_httpoxy_attack.html))

### Go

* Go code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, thatâll mean the vulnerable code uses
  the `net/http/cgi` package.
  + As with Python, this is not considered a usual way of deploying Go as a web application, so this vulnerability should be
    relatively rare
  + Goâs `net/http/fcgi` package, by comparison, does not set actual environment variables, so it is *not* vulnerable
* Vulnerable versions of `net/http` will trust and use `HTTP_PROXY` for outgoing requests, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in Go `1.7rc3`, all stable versions of `>=1.7`

## Immediate Mitigation

The best immediate mitigation is to block `Proxy` request headers as early as possible, and before they hit your
application. This is easy and safe.

* Itâs safe because the `Proxy` header is undefined by the IETF, and isnât listed on the
  [IANAâs registry of message headers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml). This means
  **there is no standard use for the header at all**; not even a provisional use-case.
* Standards-compliant HTTP clients and servers will never read or send this header.
* You can either strip the header or completely block requests attempting to use it.
* You should try to do your mitigation as *early* and as far *upstream* as you can.
  + Do it âat the edgeâ, where HTTP requests first enter your system.
  + That way, you can fix lots of vulnerable software at once.
  + Everything behind a reverse proxy or application firewall that strips the `Proxy` header is safe!

How you block a `Proxy` header depends on the specifics of your setup. The earliest convenient place to block the header
might be at a web application firewall device, or directly on the webserver running Apache or NGINX. Here are a few of
the more common mitigations:

### NGINX/FastCGI

Use this to block the header from being passed on to PHP-FPM, PHP-PM etc.

```
fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";

```

In FastCGI configurations, PHP is vulnerable (but many other languages that use NGINX FastCGI are not).

For specific NGINX coverage, we recommend that you read the official [NGINX blog post](https://www.nginx.com/blog/mitigating-the-httpoxy-vulnerability-with-nginx)
on this vulnerability. The blog post provides a graphic depiction of how
httpoxy works and more extensive mitigation information for NGINX.

### Apache

For specific Apache coverage (and details for other Apache software projects like Tomcat), we strongly recommend
you read the [Apache Software Foundationâs official advisory](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt) on
the matter. The very basic mitigation information youâll find below is covered in much greater depth there.

If youâre using Apache HTTP Server with `mod_cgi`, languages like Go and Python may be vulnerable (the `HTTP_PROXY` env var
is ârealâ). And `mod_php` is affected due to the nature of PHP. If you are using **mod\_headers**, you can unset the
`Proxy` header before further processing with this directive:

```
RequestHeader unset Proxy early

```

Example for using this in `.htaccess` files:

```
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
   RequestHeader unset Proxy
</IfModule>

```

If you are using **mod\_security**, you can use a `SecRule` to deny traffic with a `Proxy` header. Hereâs an example,
vary the action to taste, and make sure `SecRuleEngine` is on. The 1000005 ID has been assigned to this issue.

```
SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Proxy "@gt 0" "id:1000005,log,deny,msg:'httpoxy denied'"

```

Finally, if youâre using Apache Traffic Server, itâs not itself affected, but you can use it to strip the `Proxy` header; very helpful
for any services sitting behind it. Again, see the [ASFâs guidance](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt),
but one possible configuration is:

* Within `plugin.config`, inside the configuration directory (e.g. `/usr/local/etc/trafficserver` or `/etc/trafficserver`),
  add the following directive:

  ```
  header_rewrite.so strip_proxy.conf

  ```
* Add the following to a new file named `strip_proxy.conf` in the same directory:

  ```
  cond %{READ_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK}
  rm-header Proxy

  ```

### HAProxy

This will strip the header off requests:

```
http-request del-header Proxy

```

If your version of HAProxy is old (i.e. `1.4` or earlier), you may not have the `http-request del-header` directive.
If so, you must also take care that headers are stripped from requests served after the first one over an HTTP 1.1
keep-alive connection. (i.e. take special note of the limitation described in the first paragraph of [the 1.4 âheader
manipulationâ documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.4/configuration.html#6))

### Varnish

For Varnish, the following should unset the header. Add it to the pre-existing vcl\_recv section:

```
sub vcl_recv {
    [...]
    unset req.http.proxy;
    [...]
}

```
### OpenBSD relayd

For relayd, the following should remove the header. Add it to a pre-existing filter:

```
http protocol httpfilter {
        match request header remove "Proxy"
}

```
### lighttpd

#### <= 1.4.40

To reject requests containing a `Proxy` header

* Create `/path/to/deny-proxy.lua`, read-only to lighttpd, with the content:

  ```
  if (lighty.request["Proxy"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end

  ```
* Modify `lighttpd.conf` to load `mod_magnet` and run the above lua code:

  ```
  server.modules += ( "mod_magnet" )
  magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua" )

  ```

#### lighttpd2 (development)

To strip the `Proxy` header from the request, add the following to `lighttpd.conf`:

```
req_header.remove "Proxy";

```
### Microsoft IIS with PHP or a CGI framework

For detailed information about mitigating httpoxy on IIS, you should
head to the official [Microsoft article KB3179800](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3179800), which covers
the below mitigations in greater detail.

Also important to know: httpoxy does not affect any Microsoft Web Frameworks, e.g. not ASP.NET nor Active Server Pages.
But if you have installed PHP or any other third party framework on top of IIS, we recommend applying mitigation steps
to protect from httpoxy attacks. You can either block requests containing a `Proxy` header, or clear the header. (The header
is safe to block, because browsers will not generally send it at all).

To *block* requests that contain a `Proxy` header (the preferred solution), run the following command line.

```
appcmd set config /section:requestfiltering /+requestlimits.headerLimits.[header='proxy',sizelimit='0']

```

**Note:** `appcmd.exe` is not typically in the path and can be found in the `%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv` directory

To *clear* the value of the header, use the following URL Rewrite rule:

```
<system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
        <rules>
            <rule name="Erase HTTP_PROXY" patternSyntax="Wildcard">
                <match url="*.*" />
                <serverVariables>
                    <set name="HTTP_PROXY" value="" />
                </serverVariables>
                <action type="None" />
            </rule>
        </rules>
    </rewrite>
</system.webServer>

```

**Note:** URL Rewrite is a downloadable add-in for IIS and is not included in a default IIS installation.

### Hiawatha

You can block any request containing a `Proxy` header (or ban the sending client) via the UrlToolkit:

```
UrlToolkit {
  ToolkitID = block_httpoxy
  Header Proxy .* DenyAccess
}

```

See more information at the [hiawatha blog](https://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/weblog/115)

### LiteSpeed Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 5.0.19` or `>= 5.1.7` to mitigate. You can do this manually with one of these commands, or youâll get
an upgrade notification soon.

```
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.0.19 # or
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.1.7

```

See more information at the [litespeed blog](http://blog.litespeedtech.com/2016/07/18/the-httpoxy-vulnerability-has-been-taken-care-of-by-litespeed-automatically/)

### h2o Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 2.0.2` and add this to your configuration:

```
setenv:
  HTTP_PROXY: ""

```

More information can be found in this [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/996).

### Other CGI software and applications

Please let us know of other places where httpoxy is found. Weâd be happy to help you communicate fixes for your platform,
server or library if you are affected. Contact contact@httpoxy.org to let us
know. Or create a PR or issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org) in GitHub.

## Ineffective fixes in PHP

Userland PHP fixes donât work. Donât bother:

* Using `unset($_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY'])` does not affect the value returned from `getenv()`, so is not an effective
  mitigation
* Using `putenv('HTTP_PROXY=')` does not work either (to be precise: it only works if that value is coming from an
  actual environment variable rather than a header â so, it cannot be used for mitigation)

## Prevention

### Summary

* If you can avoid it, do not deploy into environments where the CGI data is merged into the actual environment variables
* Use and expect `CGI_HTTP_PROXY` to set the proxy for a CGI applicationâs internal requests, if necessary
  + You can still support `HTTP_PROXY`, but you must assert that CGI is not in use
  + In PHP, check `PHP_SAPI == 'cli'`
  + Otherwise, a simple check is to not trust `HTTP_PROXY` if `REQUEST_METHOD` is also set. RFC 3875 seems to require
    this meta-variable:

    > The `REQUEST_METHOD` meta-variable MUST be set to the method which should be used by the script to process the request

### Donât Trust `HTTP_PROXY` Under CGI

To put it plainly: there is no way to trust the value of an `HTTP_` env var in a CGI environment. They cannot be
distinguished from request headers according to the specification. So, *any* usage of `HTTP_PROXY` in a CGI context is
suspicious.

If you need to configure the proxy of a CGI application via an environment variable, use a variable name that will
never conflict with request headers. That is: one that does not begin with `HTTP_`. We strongly recommend you go for
`CGI_HTTP_PROXY`. (As seen in Ruby and libwww-perlâs mitigations for this issue.)

### PHP

CLI-only code may safely trust `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` or `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`. But bear in mind that code written
for the CLI context often ends up running in a SAPI eventually, particularly utility or library code. And, with open
source code, that might not even be your doing. So, if you are going to rely on `HTTP_PROXY` at all, you should guard
that code with a check of the `PHP_SAPI` constant.

### Network Configuration as Prevention

A defense-in-depth strategy that can combat httpoxy (and entire classes of other security problems) is to severely restrict
the outgoing requests your web application can make to an absolute minimum. For example, if a web application is
firewalled in such a way that it *cannot* make outgoing HTTP requests, an attacker will not be able to receive
the âmisproxiedâ requests (because the web application is prevented from connecting to the attacker).

### HTTPS

And, of course, another defense-in-depth strategy that works is to use HTTPS for internal requests, not just for
securing your siteâs connections to the outside world. HTTPS requests arenât affected by `HTTP_PROXY`.

## How It Works

Using PHP as an example, because it is illustrative. PHP has a method called `getenv()`[1](#fn:php-getenv).

There is a common vulnerability in many PHP libraries and applications, introduced by confusing
`getenv` for a method that only returns environment variables. In fact, getenv() is closer to the
`$_SERVER` superglobal: it contains both environment variables and user-controlled data.

Specifically, when PHP is running under a CGI-like server, the HTTP request headers (data supplied
by the client) are merged into the `$_SERVER` superglobal under keys beginning with `HTTP_`. This is
the same information that `getenv` reads from.

When a user sends a request with a `Proxy` header, the header appears to the PHP application as `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`.
Some common PHP libraries have been trusting this value, even when run in a CGI/SAPI environment.

Reading and trusting `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` is exactly the same vulnerability, but tends to happen much less often
(perhaps because of getenvâs name, perhaps because the semantics of the `$_SERVER` superglobal are better understood among
the community).

### Minimal example code

Note that these examples require deployment into a vulnerable environment before there is actually a vulnerability
(e.g. php-fpm, or Apacheâs `ScriptAlias`)

#### PHP

```
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$client->get('http://api.internal/?secret=foo')

```
#### Python

```
from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
def application(environ, start_response):
    requests.get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
CGIHandler().run(application)

```
#### Go

```
cgi.Serve(
    http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        res, _ := http.Get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
        // [...]

```

More complete PoC repos (using Docker, and testing with an actual listener for the proxied request) have been prepared
under the [httpoxy Github organization](https://github.com/httpoxy).

## Why It Happened

Under the CGI spec, headers are provided mixed into the environment variables. (These are formally known as
âProtocol-Specific Meta-Variablesâ[2](#fn:meta-variables)). Thatâs just the way the spec works, not a failure or bug.

The goal of the code, in most of the vulnerabilities, is to find the correct proxy to use, when auto-configuring a
client for the internal HTTP request made shortly after. This task in Ruby could be completed by
the `find_proxy` method of `URI::Generic`, which notes:

> `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY` are treated specially under the CGI environment, because `HTTP_PROXY` may be set by Proxy:
> header. So `HTTP_PROXY` is not used. `http_proxy` is not used too if the variable is case insensitive. `CGI_HTTP_PROXY`
> can be used instead.
>
> From the [Ruby stdlib documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI/Generic.html#method-i-find_proxy)

Other instances of the same vulnerability are present in other languages. For example, when
using Goâs `net/http/cgi` module, and deploying as a CGI application. This indicates the vulnerability
is a standard danger in CGI environments.

## History of httpoxy

This bug was first discovered over 15 years ago. The timeline goes something like:

March 2001

The issue is discovered in libwww-perl and fixed. Reported by Randal L. Schwartz. [3](#fn:perl-bug)

April 2001

The issue is discovered in curl, and fixed there too (albeit probably not for Windows). Reported by Cris Bailiff. [4](#fn:curl-bug)

July 2012

In implementing `HTTP_PROXY` for `Net::HTTP`, the Ruby team notice and avoid the potential issue. Nice work Akira Tanaka! [5](#fn:ruby-ref)

November 2013

The issue is mentioned on the NGINX mailing list. The user humbly points out the issue: âunless
Iâm missing something, which is very possibleâ. No, Jonathan Matthews, you were exactly right! [6](#fn:nginx-ref)

February 2015

The issue is mentioned on the Apache httpd-dev mailing list. Spotted by Stefan Fritsch. [7](#fn:apache-ref)

July 2016

Scott Geary, an engineer at Vend, found an instance of the bug in the wild. The Vend security team found the vulnerability
was still exploitable in PHP, and present in many modern languages and libraries. We started to disclose to security response teams.

So, the bug was lying dormant for years, like a latent infection: pox. We imagine that many people may have found the issue over
the years, but never investigated its scope in other languages and libraries. If youâve found a historical discussion
of interest that weâve missed, let us know. You can contact contact@httpoxy.org
or create an issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org).

## CVEs

httpoxy has a number of CVEs assigned. These cover the cases where

* a language or CGI implementation makes the `Proxy` header available in such a way that the application cannot tell whether
  it is a real environment variable, or
* an application trusts the value of the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable by default in a CGI environment (but only where that application should have been
  able to tell it came from a request)

The assigned CVEs so far:

* CVE-2016-5385: PHP
* CVE-2016-5386: Go
* CVE-2016-5387: Apache HTTP Server
* CVE-2016-5388: Apache Tomcat
* CVE-2016-6286: spiffy-cgi-handlers for CHICKEN
* CVE-2016-6287: CHICKENâs http-client
* CVE-2016-1000104: mod\_fcgi
* CVE-2016-1000105: Nginx cgi script
* CVE-2016-1000107: Erlang inets
* CVE-2016-1000108: YAWS
* CVE-2016-1000109: HHVM FastCGI
* CVE-2016-1000110: Python CGIHandler
* CVE-2016-1000111: Python Twisted
* CVE-2016-1000212: lighttpd

We suspect there may be more CVEs coming for httpoxy, as less common software is checked over. If you
want to get a CVE assigned for an httpoxy issue, there are a couple of options:

* For open source code projects, you can use the [Distributed Weakness Filing Project](https://distributedweaknessfiling.org/) (DWF).
  They have a simple way to report (public) issues using the form at [iwantacve.org](https://iwantacve.org/)
* For closed source code projects, you can talk to [MITRE, or one of their participating CNAs/vendors/coordinators](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html).

Over the past two weeks, the Vend security team worked to disclose the issue responsibly to as many affected parties as we
could. Weâd like to thank the members of:

* The Red Hat Product Security team, who provided extremely useful advice and access to their experience disclosing
  widespread vulnerabilities - if youâre sitting on a big or complicated disclosure, theyâre a great resource to reach
  out to for help.
* The language and implementation teams, who kept to disclosure norms and provided lively discussion.

Thereâs an [extra](extra.html) page with some meta-discussion on the whole named disclosure thing and contact details.
The content on this page is licensed as [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (TL;DR: use what you
like, no permission/attribution necessary).

Iâve put together some more opinionated notes on httpoxy on [my Medium account](https://medium.com/%40nzdominic).

Regards,

Dominic Scheirlinck and the httpoxy disclosure team

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-1000107 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000107)

#### Description

inets in Erlang possibly 22.1 and earlier follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue.

Subject: Re: A CGI application vulnerability for PHP, Go,
 Python and others

Also the current list of CVEs is:

CVE-2016-5385 PHP
CVE-2016-5386 Go
CVE-2016-5387 Apache HTTPD
CVE-2016-1000104 mod_fcgi
CVE-2016-1000105 Nginx cgi script
CVE-2016-5388 Tomcat
CVE-2016-1000107 Erlang HTTP Server
CVE-2016-1000108 YAWS
CVE-2016-1000109 HHVM FastCGI
CVE-2016-1000110 Python CGIHandler
CVE-2016-1000111 Python twisted

there will of course be more. From my Google doc:

CVE counting for httpoxy

This document essentially discusses the CVE counting strategy for the
httpoxy issue.

Essentially there are two main cases where a CVE is assigned for the
httpoxy issue:

   1.

   A web server, programming language or framework (and in some limited
   situations the application itself) sets the environmental variable
   HTTP_PROXY from the user supplied Proxy header in the web request, or sets
   a similarly used variable (essentially when the request header turns from
   harmless data into a potentially harmful environmental variable)
   2.

   A web application makes use of HTTP_PROXY or similar variable unsafely
   (e.g. fails to check the request type) resulting in an attacker controlled
   proxy being used (essentially when HTTP_PROXY is actually used unsafely)

Some  examples of situations where a web server, programming language or
framework would qualify for a CVE regarding httpoxy:

   1.

   PHP passes the proxy as HTTP_PROXY, as such applications commonly import
   and use HTTP_*
   2.

   mod_cgi/fast_cgi and related CGI programs set HTTP_PROXY based on the
   request header
   3.

   An application uses an HTTP request library that trusts HTTP_PROXY
   resulting in attacker control of requests

Some  examples of situations where a web server, programming language or
framework would NOT qualify for a CVE regarding httpoxy:

   1.

   A web server such as Apache passes the proxy header to a programming
   language or framework
   2.

   A library trusts HTTP_PROXY, the library does not earn a CVE, the
   application using it would qualify for a CVE, and generally speaking
   whatever set the HTTP_PROXY variable would also earn a CVE

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=989569#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2016-07-19 15:01:17 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #988484](show_bug.cgi?id=988484 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: TRACKERBUG: Setting HTTP_PROXY environment variable via Proxy header (httpoxy)") +++  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/95>  The Vend security team would like to publicly disclose a vulnerability we've (re)discovered in CGI and PHP web applications. Here's a two line summary:      -     RFC 3875 (CGI) puts the HTTP Proxy header from a request into the    environment variables as HTTP_PROXY      -     HTTP_PROXY is a popular environment variable used to configure an    outgoing proxy   The consequence is that an attacker can force a proxy of their choice to be used. This proxy receives the full request for anything sent over HTTP using a vulnerable client. It can also act in a malicious way to tie up server resources (a "reverse slowloris").  For the purposes of general disclosure to the wider ecosystem, we've prepared a website that describes the issue and collects common mitigations: <https://httpoxy.org/> - but I'll continue with some notes below.  Particularly affected is anything using the Guzzle HTTP library for PHP, but also many other languages and frameworks when deployed under 'real' CGI (PHP's userspace is basically emulated CGI), including Go's net/http and Python's requests. This bug appears to be more than 15 years old, and was fixed in a piecemeal fashion in other software (e.g. curl, libwww-perl, Ruby).  The good news, however, is that stripping any Proxy request header is easy (because it is undefined by IETF and not listed in IANA's registry of message headers) - there should be no standard use for the header at all.  Over the past two weeks, we've disclosed to the language teams affected (PHP, Python, Go, HHVM), as well as common CGI implementation vendors (Nginx, Apache). CERT have been involved in this process, and we’ve had the help of the Red Hat Product Security team. All these teams will probably have good advisories for their own specific affected software.  The Apache Software Foundation have an advisory available at <https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt>  The original discovery in 2001 seems to have been by Randal L. Schwartz. 2016 discovery was made by Scott Geary, research and disclosure co-ordinated by Dominic Scheirlinck, colleagues of mine.   References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-1000107> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/95> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=989569#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2016-07-19 15:01:51 UTC  ``` Looks like here.. <https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/maint/lib/inets/src/http_server> /httpd_script_env.erl#L125-L126 ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=989569#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-07-19 22:00:57 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=989569#c4)  Andreas Stieger   2016-07-28 14:09:05 UTC  ``` Upstream reaction unclear: <https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-198> I see that couchdb uses erlang, but I did not see it reading the environment.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1824460#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-04-16 09:32:46 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in inets in Erlang possibly 22.1 and earlier follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue.  Reference: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/07/18/6> <https://httpoxy.org/> <https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-198>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1824460#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-04-16 09:33:33 UTC  ``` Created erlang tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1824461](show_bug.cgi?id=1824461 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-1000107 erlang: allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy serve [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1824460#c2)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-04-16 09:34:39 UTC  ``` Created erlang tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-8 [[bug 1824463](show_bug.cgi?id=1824463 "NEW - CVE-2016-1000107 erlang: allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy serve [epel-8]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1824460#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-18 04:31:50 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2016-1000107>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1824460#c6)  Nick Tait    2020-04-20 17:27:01 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat CloudFroms 5.10 ship affected Erlang package, however, CloudFroms uses it as a dependency for Ansible Tower and do not expose it anywhere in product. Furthermore, Ansible Tower does not pass environment variables to RabbitMQ or Erlang which makes it not affected.  Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships the affected Erlang package, however it is only used as a dependency for RabbitMQ and is not exposed outside the management network. As this network is tightly-regulated to OpenStack administrators, the risk for abuse is significantly reduced.   ``` |  |

and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted
client data in the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable, which might allow
remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an
arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka
an "httpoxy" issue.
