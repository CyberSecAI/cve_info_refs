Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-1000107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability, known as "httpoxy," arises from a namespace conflict in CGI (Common Gateway Interface) and CGI-like environments.
*   RFC 3875 (CGI) specifies that the HTTP `Proxy` header from a client request should be placed into environment variables as `HTTP_PROXY`.
*   `HTTP_PROXY` is also a commonly used environment variable to configure an outgoing proxy for HTTP clients.
*   This conflict allows an attacker to potentially control the proxy server used by a vulnerable application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CGI Environment Variable Pollution:** CGI implementations incorrectly merge HTTP headers into environment variables, making it impossible to distinguish between genuine environment variables and attacker-controlled HTTP headers.
*   **Unsafe Trust of `HTTP_PROXY`:** Vulnerable applications trust the value of the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable without verifying if it originates from a trusted source or if it is provided by the client request.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** There is a lack of validation and sanitization of HTTP headers in CGI environments that leads to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection of Outgoing Requests:** An attacker can force a vulnerable application to use a malicious proxy. This means all outgoing HTTP requests made by the application will be sent through the attacker's controlled proxy server.
*   **Interception of Sensitive Data:** The attacker can intercept sensitive data that the application sends in its outgoing HTTP requests.
*   **Manipulation of Outgoing Requests:** The attacker can potentially modify the outgoing requests made by the application
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  An attacker can force the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy, leading to potential denial-of-service or tying up resources due to reverse slowloris.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP `Proxy` Header:** The primary attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a `Proxy` header.
*   **CGI/CGI-like Context:** The application must be running within a CGI or CGI-like context where HTTP headers are converted into environment variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Control Over Proxy:** The attacker needs to control a proxy server that the vulnerable application can connect to.

**Affected Languages/Environments:**

*   **PHP:** When running under CGI-like server (php-fpm, mod\_php) using vulnerable HTTP clients like Guzzle.
*   **Python:** When deployed under CGI using libraries like `requests` which trust `HTTP_PROXY`
*   **Go:** When deployed under CGI using the `net/http/cgi` package.
*   **Erlang:** Vulnerable due to its inets module following RFC 3875.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Block `Proxy` header:** The most effective immediate mitigation is to block the `Proxy` header at the edge, before it reaches the application. This can be done through web application firewalls, reverse proxies, or web servers such as Apache, NGINX, and HAProxy.
*   **Use `CGI_HTTP_PROXY`:** If a proxy must be configured, use an environment variable that does not conflict with HTTP headers, such as `CGI_HTTP_PROXY`.
*   **Check `REQUEST_METHOD`:** Do not trust `HTTP_PROXY` if `REQUEST_METHOD` is set in the environment, as this indicates CGI is in use.
*  **Defense-in-depth:** Restricting outgoing connections of the web application as much as possible. Using HTTPS instead of HTTP.

**Specific to Erlang:**

*   The `inets` module in Erlang follows RFC 3875, which makes it vulnerable.
*   Erlang does not directly set HTTP\_PROXY based on a Proxy: header. The mitigation in Erlang is essentially to remove the potentially dangerous environment variable.

**CVE-2016-1000107:**

*   Specifically assigned to the Erlang `inets` module.
*   It is part of the larger "httpoxy" vulnerability disclosure.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is not new; it was previously discovered and fixed in some software (e.g., `libwww-perl`, `curl`, `Ruby`) and has resurfaced due to the widespread use of CGI in web applications and libraries.
*   User-land PHP fixes such as `unset($_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY'])` and `putenv('HTTP_PROXY=')` are ineffective for mitigation.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable if the application makes outgoing HTTP (not HTTPS) requests.
*   The vulnerability can affect any version of PHP if using vulnerable libraries.
