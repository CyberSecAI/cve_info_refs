Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `save.php` file of the `contus-video-comments` WordPress plugin. This file directly takes data from the `HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA` and saves it as a `.jpg` file. Critically, the filename is constructed using the `id` parameter from the GET request, which is not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The script does not require any authentication to upload files.
2.  **Path Traversal:** The script is vulnerable to path traversal because it uses unsanitized user input (`$_GET["id"]`) to construct the file path, allowing an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations within the server's file system.
3.  **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload any data as a .jpg file. This could be a PHP file which when accessed can give attackers command execution on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
1.  **Write Arbitrary Files:** The attacker can upload files to any location on the server that the webserver has write access to.
2.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to full control of the web application and possibly the entire server.
3.  **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data.
4.  **Denial of Service:** An attacker could overwrite critical system files leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `save.php` file, with the file contents as the POST data and the file path in the GET parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress installation.
2.  **No Authentication Required:** No user account or authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability; it is accessible to any user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker can use `curl` to upload a file (`image.jpg`) to an arbitrary path using path traversal (`../image`).
*   The plugin was closed on September 26, 2013 and is not available for download. This implies that this vulnerability was not patched.
