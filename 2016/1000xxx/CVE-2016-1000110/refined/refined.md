Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Python's CGIHandler class processes the "Proxy" HTTP request header. Specifically, the CGIHandler incorrectly creates an environment variable `HTTP_PROXY` based on the user-supplied value of the "Proxy" header. This is a namespace collision, as HTTP_PROXY is a commonly used environment variable to configure proxy settings for HTTP clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Environment Variable Injection:** The CGIHandler directly translates user-supplied data from the "Proxy" header into an environment variable (`HTTP_PROXY`) without proper sanitization.
- **Namespace Collision:** The vulnerability is caused by the conflict between the CGI standard for HTTP headers in environment variables and the use of `HTTP_PROXY` to configure HTTP clients.
- **Implicit Trust:** Python HTTP client libraries trust the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **HTTP request redirection:** A malicious attacker can control the `HTTP_PROXY` variable by supplying a "Proxy" header in a crafted HTTP request. This allows the attacker to redirect HTTP requests initiated by a Python CGI script to a proxy server under the attacker's control.
- **Information Exposure:** If sensitive data are included in the outgoing HTTP requests, the attacker could intercept and view it through the malicious proxy.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can send back modified or malformed responses, potentially impacting the application's functionality.
- **Denial of Service:** By redirecting to a slow proxy server, an attacker can tie up resources or cause connection timeouts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable Python application running as a CGI script. This request includes a malicious "Proxy" header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need to have elevated privileges or credentials on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is often associated with the "httpoxy" vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Python applications that use the CGIHandler class of wsgiref library when running as a CGI application. WSGI applications are not affected if the wsgi environment map is properly separated from the system environment map.
- Multiple Linux distributions (e.g. Fedora, Red Hat, SUSE, Debian, Ubuntu) were affected, as well as their derived distributions and products and were patched.
- Patches for this vulnerability either discard the HTTP_PROXY if it is detected to be running as CGI or handle it properly.
- This vulnerability affects multiple versions of python 2.x and 3.x before the fix was applied.
- The GitHub search results mostly refer to various code repositories and issue trackers where this vulnerability was mentioned or resolved.
