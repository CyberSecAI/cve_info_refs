Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1000124

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ajax_url.php` file of the Huge-IT Portfolio Gallery plugin. Specifically, the `galleryid` parameter, which is passed via a POST request, is directly inserted into an SQL query without being validated or sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `galleryid` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive database information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** It could be possible to modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can lead to privilege escalation if the database user has higher privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The provided exploit shows it causes internal server errors that can lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `ajax_url.php` file.
*   **`galleryid` parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `galleryid` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable Joomla application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning an attacker doesn't need any credentials to exploit it.
*  **Knowledge of Target:**  The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script, `ajax_url.php`, within the component.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in `ajax_url.php`, specifically lines 49-59:
```php
49  $page = $_POST["page"];
50  $num=$_POST['perpage'];
51  $start = $page * $num - $num;
52  $idofgallery=$_POST['galleryid'];
53  $level = $_POST['level'];
54  $query = $db->getQuery(true);
55  $query->select('*');
56  $query->from('#__huge_itportfolio_images');
57  $query->where('portfolio_id ='.$idofgallery);
58  $query ->order('#__huge_itportfolio_images.ordering asc');
59  $db->setQuery($query,$start,$num);
```

The value of `$idofgallery` is taken directly from the `$_POST['galleryid']` variable and concatenated into the SQL query without any sanitization, thus allowing an attacker to inject SQL code using specially crafted `galleryid` values.

**Exploit Code (from the advisory):**
The provided `sqlmap` command shows how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability:
```
sqlmap -u 'http://example.com/components/com_portfoliogallery/ajax_url.php' --data="page=1&galleryid=*&post=huge_it_portfolio_gallery_ajax&perpage=20&linkbutton=2"
```
This command uses `sqlmap` to automatically identify and test the SQL injection point in the `galleryid` parameter.  The advisory provides example payloads to verify both error-based and time-based SQL injection:
Error-based payload: `page=1&galleryid=-2264 OR 1 GROUP BY CONCAT(0x71716a7a71,(SELECT (CASE WHEN (3883=3883) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)),0x7178627071,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2)) HAVING MIN(0)#&post=huge_it_portfolio_gallery_ajax&perpage=20&linkbutton=2`
Time-based blind payload: `page=1&galleryid=(CASE WHEN (9445=9445) THEN SLEEP(5) ELSE 9445 END)&post=huge_it_portfolio_gallery_ajax&perpage=20&linkbutton=2`

The exploit also shows that the backend DBMS is MySQL and indicates that internal server errors (HTTP 500) were detected during testing.
