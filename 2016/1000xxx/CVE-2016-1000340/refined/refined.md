  "CVE-2016-1000340": {
    "Description": "The provided data reveals a carry propagation bug in the `math.raw.Nat` class within the Bouncy Castle library. This vulnerability is part of a larger set of Bouncy Castle vulnerabilities addressed in a Red Hat Security Advisory.",
    "Root cause": "A carry propagation bug in the implementation of squaring for several raw math classes within the Bouncy Castle library.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Carry propagation bug"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential for rare, spurious calculations during elliptic curve scalar multiplications.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation of a flaw in carry propagation logic that could lead to the addition or modification of data"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are outlined, but it is assumed an attacker would need to perform actions that trigger the vulnerable code path.",
       "Additional Information": [
           "The vulnerability is addressed in the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider versions 1.56 and later.",
        "The vulnerability may have been detected with high probability by the output validation for the scalar multipliers, mitigating some of the risk."
