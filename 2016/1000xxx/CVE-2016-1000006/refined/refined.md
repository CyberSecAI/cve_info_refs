    {
      "cve": "CVE-2016-1000006",
      "description": "hhvm before 3.12.11 has a use-after-free in the serialize_memoize_param() and ResourceBundle::__construct() functions.",
      "affected_component": "hhvm",
      "root_cause": "Use-after-free",

      "impact": "The vulnerability allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code due to the use-after-free condition. This is a critical issue that may lead to a complete compromise of the system.",
      "attack_vector": "Network",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to craft a specific input to trigger the use-after-free condition in the `serialize_memoize_param()` or `ResourceBundle::__construct()` functions of the affected HHVM versions. This suggests a network-based attack is feasible.",
