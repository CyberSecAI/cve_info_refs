The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities discovered in Ruckus ZoneFlex and H500 access points. While the CVE description is a placeholder, the content provides specific details of the vulnerabilities discovered which are described below:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Command Injection:** Lack of input sanitization in the ping diagnostic functionality allows for arbitrary command execution.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Specific string in HTTP requests leads to 200 OK responses, allowing access to data intended for authenticated users.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Accessing a specific page over HTTP, then attempting the same request over SSL, crashes the management interface.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Device's serial number is exposed via the HTTP server.
*  **Excessive memory consumption:** Authenticated requests to a certain page will cause the HTTP server to reload which can also cause disruption of other services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Lack of input sanitization leading to command injection.
*   Insufficient authentication checks allowing for authentication bypass.
*   Poor error handling causing denial of service
*   Information disclosure by exposing the serial number.
*   Lack of proper resource management causing excessive memory consumption

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Command Injection:** Allows an attacker to gain root shell access, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Allows attackers to access sensitive information and potentially modify device configurations.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causes the management interface to become unavailable, disrupting network functionality.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposed serial number can be used in social engineering or other attacks.
*   **Excessive Memory Consumption**: Causes HTTP server to reload, possibly disrupting other services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command Injection:** Forged HTTP requests with malicious ping parameters.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Sending HTTP requests with a specific string to bypass authentication.
*   **Denial of Service:** Sending crafted requests to a specific page.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing the device through its HTTP server.
*  **Excessive Memory Consumption**: Sending GET requests via CSRF attacks (malicious images/emails).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Ruckus device.
*   No prior authentication is required for exploiting the command injection, DoS and the authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
*   Exploitation of the memory consumption vulnerability can be done via CSRF and may require a user to click on a link or image.
*  For the command injection, the attacker must be able to send a crafted ping parameter.
