  "CVE-2016-1000346": {
    "description": "In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the other party DH public key is not fully validated. This can cause issues as invalid keys can be used to reveal details about the other party's private key where static Diffie-Hellman is in use. As of release 1.56 the key parameters are checked on agreement calculation.",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of the other party's Diffie-Hellman (DH) public key during key agreement. Specifically, the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider prior to version 1.56 does not fully validate the DH public key received from the other party. This lack of validation can lead to the use of invalid keys, potentially exposing the other party's private key when static Diffie-Hellman is in use.",
    "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of the other party's private key, especially in scenarios where static Diffie-Hellman is employed.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit the lack of proper validation of the other party's DH public key during the key exchange process.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to participate in a Diffie-Hellman key exchange with a vulnerable system or application. It is assumed the attacker can send and receive messages to/from the vulnerable system.",
