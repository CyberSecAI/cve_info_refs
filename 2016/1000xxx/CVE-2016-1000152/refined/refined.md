Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `formId` GET parameter in the `popup-insert-help.php` file of the tidio-form WordPress plugin. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The unsanitized input from the `formId` parameter is directly embedded into the HTML output, allowing malicious scripts to be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies and session tokens, leading to session hijacking.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the page viewed by the victim.
- **Redirection:** The attacker could redirect the user to malicious websites.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could perform phishing attacks by injecting fake login forms or other deceptive content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript code within the `formId` parameter.
- The attacker would need to entice a victim to click on this malicious URL. This could be done through various methods such as social engineering, email, or other websites.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any special access to the server.
- The attacker must be able to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript code in the `formId` parameter.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted URL to the victim, usually through social engineering or another communication channel.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to inject a simple JavaScript alert using the `formId` parameter.
- The vulnerability exists in `popup-insert-help.php` at line 36.
- The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download from the WordPress plugin directory, likely due to this and other vulnerabilities.
