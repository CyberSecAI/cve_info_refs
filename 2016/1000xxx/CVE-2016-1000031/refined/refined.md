  "CVE-2016-1000031": {
    "description": "Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.3.3 DiskFileItem File Manipulation Remote Code Execution",
    "root_cause": "The `DiskFileItem` class in Apache Commons FileUpload has a `readObject` method that, when deserializing a crafted object, can write or copy files to arbitrary locations, and potentially execute arbitrary code on older Java Virtual Machines.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Improper validation of serialized data",
       "Lack of sufficient checks on file operations"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, arbitrary file creation, modification or deletion leading to denial of service or data compromise. Impact varies depending on the application's implementation and the Java VM version used.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Deserialization of a crafted `DiskFileItem` object received through a network interface (e.g., RMI)",
	  "Manipulation of serialized data before deserialization"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to send a crafted serialized Java object to a vulnerable server.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by modifying serialized data, manipulating parameters such as the repository path, cached content, and threshold values to control where files are written, what content is written and from where content is copied. This can be used with `ysoserial` to achieve remote code execution.",
     "affected_versions": "Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.3.3, Apache Wicket versions before 6.25.0 and 1.5.17, and other products using these vulnerable libraries, such as NetIQ Sentinel, JBoss, Red Hat products, and others."
