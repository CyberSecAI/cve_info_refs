# [R3] Apache Commons FileUpload DiskFileItem File Manipulation Remote Code Execution (LOBSTER)

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

**Lots Of Bad Serialization To Exploit Remotely (LOBSTER)**

We forgot to make a logo and register a domain.

**Summary**

There exists a Java Object in the Apache Commons FileUpload library that can be manipulated in such a way that when it is deserialized, it can write or copy files to disk in arbitrary locations. Furthermore, while the Object can be used alone, this new vector can be integrated with [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) to upload and execute binaries in a single deserialization call. This may or may not work depending on an application's implementation of the FileUpload library.

**Background**

In late 2015 FoxGlove Security [released a write up](http://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/) on using Chris Frohoff’s yososerial tool to gain remote code execution on a variety of commercial products, [based on a presentation at AppSec Cali](http://www.slideshare.net/frohoff1/appseccali-2015-marshalling-pickles) in January, 2015. The ysoserial tool uses “gadgets” in Apache Commons Collections, Groovy, and Spring that do “unexpected” things during deserialization. Specifically, the ysoserial payloads eventually execute `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` allowing for remote Java code execution.

The Apache Commons project maintains a library called “[FileUpload](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-fileupload/)” to make “*it easy to add robust, high-performance, file upload capability to your servlets and web applications.*” One of the classes in the FileUpload library is called “[DiskFileItem](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-fileupload/apidocs/org/apache/commons/fileupload/disk/DiskFileItem.html)”. A `DiskFileItem` is used to handle file uploads. Interestingly, `DiskFileItem` is serializable and implements custom `writeObject()` and `readObject()` functions.

**DiskFileItem’s readObject Implementation**

Here is the implementation that currently exists at the projects repository tip (as of 1/28/16):

```

632    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in)
633            throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
634        // read values
635        in.defaultReadObject();
636
637        /* One expected use of serialization is to migrate HTTP sessions
638         * containing a DiskFileItem between JVMs. Particularly if the JVMs are
639         * on different machines It is possible that the repository location is
640         * not valid so validate it.
641         */
642        if (repository != null) {
643            if (repository.isDirectory()) {
644                // Check path for nulls
645                if (repository.getPath().contains("\0")) {
646                    throw new IOException(format(
647                            "The repository [%s] contains a null character",
648                            repository.getPath()));
649                }
650            } else {
651                throw new IOException(format(
652                        "The repository [%s] is not a directory",
653                        repository.getAbsolutePath()));
654            }
655        }
656
657        OutputStream output = getOutputStream();
658        if (cachedContent != null) {
659            output.write(cachedContent);
660        } else {
661            FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream(dfosFile);
662            IOUtils.copy(input, output);
663            IOUtils.closeQuietly(input);
664            dfosFile.delete();
665            dfosFile = null;
666        }
667        output.close();
668
669        cachedContent = null;
670    }

```

This is interesting due to the apparent creation of files. However, after analyzing the state of `DiskFileItem` after serialization it became clear that arbitrary file creation was not supposed to be intended:

* `dfos` (a type of `OutputStream`) is transient and therefore it is not serialized. `dfos` is regenerated by the `getOutputStream()` call above (which also generates the new File to write out to).
* The “repository” (or directory that the file is written to) has to be valid at the time of serialization in order for successful deserialization to occur.
* If there is no “cachedContent” then `readObject()` tries to read in the file from disk.
* That filename is always generated via `getOutputStream`.

**Serialized Object Modification**

The rules listed above do not take into account that someone might modify the serialized data before it is deserialized. Three important elements get serialized that we can modify:

1. The repository path (aka the directory that the file is read/written from).
2. If there is cachedContent (i.e. data that didn’t get written to the file) then that gets serialized
3. If there is no cachedContent (i.e. all data was written to disk) the full path to the output file exists.
4. The threshold value that controls if “cachedContent” is written to disk or not.

Modifying these three elements in the serialized object gives us the ability to:

1. Create files wherever we have permission on the system. The caveat here is that we only have control of the file path and not the final filename.
2. Copy the contents of files from one file on the system to a location we specify (again we only control the directory path and not the filename). This will also attempt to delete the file we copy from.. so be careful.

**Integrating with ysoserial**

While the object’s capabilities are interesting on their own, this new vector becomes much more powerful in conjunction with the current ysoserial gadgets. Combining these objects allows an attacker to upload a binary and execute it in “one” serialized object. In order to integrate these techniques, minor modifications to ysoserial are required. These include:

* Added creation of a DiskFileItem. Importantly, the DiskFileItem has some data written to it, but not enough to exceed the threshold value.
* Introduced a LinkedList<Object> and store the DiskFileItem and the ysoserial payload (in that order) in the list.
* Change CommonCollections1 to call /bin/bash, but this is by no means a requirement.

After ysoserial generates the payload that contains both a DiskFileItem and the selected gadget, the user must edit the DiskFileItem to generate a file upon deserialization. This can be automated by creating a script (e.g. ysoserial\_upload\_execute.py) which edits the Object and writes it back out to disk.

**Apache vs Vendors, Attributing Blame**

We brought the FileUpload issue to Apache's attention and they do not see it as a vulnerability. In their response to us, they stated:

"*Having reviewed your report we have concluded that it does not represent a valid vulnerability in Apache Commons File Upload. If an application deserializes data from an untrusted source without filtering and/or validation that is an application vulnerability not a vulnerability in the library a potential attacker might leverage.*"

Tenable argued that if an application intends to deserialize `DiskFileItems` then they are still vulnerable to the altered object and they could have files written anywhere on their server, which seems to cross the privilege boundaries intended by the library based on the code.

Based on our research, there is no warning about distrusting this object included in their library, or mentioning the potential for problems. It seems like there could be a few lines of code to prevent the unintended aspect of this (files written to arbitrary locations), while still maintaining the functionality of the library. In doing that, it would add a layer of protection for companies that implement the library (which many do, and we are finding vulnerable).

After another Apache person mentioned that "`java.io.File` *is serializable, too .. And, I assume that an intruder who manages to have a `DiskFileItem` created and `getInputStream()` invoked on it, can just as well create a File (or a String), and invoke new `File(Input|Output)Stream`?*" We reminded them that the act of deserializing a `DiskFileItem` can cause arbitrary files to be written to disk. The attacker does not need to invoke a new `outputstream` because `DiskFileItem's readObject()` function has already done that for him. This is not expected behavior as best we can tell. This is also not at all like deserializing a `Java.io.File`. That said, we respect Apache's stance on this and are contacting vendors that implement the Commons FileUpload library in a way that makes their software vulnerable.

### Solution

Per the Apache Software Foundation's response, it is up to each vendor/product that implements this library to ensure that it is done in such a manner that does not allow shenanigans.

Note that earlier versions of this software are likely vulnerable, but we did not test them.

I have back-ported the patch in [comment#2](show_bug.cgi?id=1128963#c2) to version 1.1.1 following the upstream fix using the commits:  02f6b2c4ef9aebf9cf8e55de8b90e73430b69385 aa9061772aed18572588f8b907861c0d0bd653c5 85551c6d55b24a40841d34e569b6dd4058309bb6 414ae63a22b802a5cc177ec6c7b895b2d78e7ae9 163a6061fbc077d4b6e4787d26857c2baba495d1 faf861d9357db380541ca95343f8baa215988900  @security-team, could you please advise here if this is a valid vulnerability and if it should be fixed in jakarta-commons-fileupload side?  [0] <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FILEUPLOAD-279> [1] <https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2016-12> [2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1393454> [3] <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1000031> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1128963#c4)  Robert Frohl   2019-03-15 14:58:53 UTC  ``` I believe it is better to fix the issue in the library. Upstream states that that application developers would need to protect their code by "provide[ing] a blacklist, or whitelist of packages, and/or classes, which may, or may not be deserialized" [0].   Which is probably not going to happen after an application was developed and is used in production(atleast in most cases).

#### Description

<http://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2016-12>

Summary

There exists a Java Object in the Apache Commons FileUpload library that can be manipulated in such a way that when it is deserialized, it can write or copy files to disk in arbitrary locations. Furthermore, while the Object can be used alone, this new vector can be integrated with ysoserial to upload and execute binaries in a single deserialization call. This may or may not work depending on an application's implementation of the FileUpload library.

Background

In late 2015 FoxGlove Security released a write up on using Chris Frohoff’s yososerial tool to gain remote code execution on a variety of commercial products, based on a presentation at AppSec Cali in January, 2015. The ysoserial tool uses “gadgets” in Apache Commons Collections, Groovy, and Spring that do “unexpected” things during deserialization. Specifically, the ysoserial payloads eventually execute Runtime.getRuntime().exec() allowing for remote Java code execution.

The Apache Commons project maintains a library called “FileUpload” to make “it easy to add robust, high-performance, file upload capability to your servlets and web applications.” One of the classes in the FileUpload library is called “DiskFileItem”. A DiskFileItem is used to handle file uploads. Interestingly, DiskFileItem is serializable and implements custom writeObject() and readObject() functions.

DiskFileItem’s readObject Implementation

Here is the implementation that currently exists at the projects repository tip (as of 1/28/16):

632 private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in)

633 throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {

634 // read values

635 in.defaultReadObject();

636

637 /\* One expected use of serialization is to migrate HTTP sessions

638 \* containing a DiskFileItem between JVMs. Particularly if the JVMs are

639 \* on different machines It is possible that the repository location is

640 \* not valid so validate it.

641 \*/

642 if (repository != null) {

643 if (repository.isDirectory()) {

644 // Check path for nulls

645 if (repository.getPath().contains("\0"))

{
646 throw new IOException(format(
647 "The repository [%s] contains a null character",
648 repository.getPath()));
649 }

650 } else

{
651 throw new IOException(format(
652 "The repository [%s] is not a directory",
653 repository.getAbsolutePath()));
654 }

655 }

656

657 OutputStream output = getOutputStream();

658 if (cachedContent != null)

{
659 output.write(cachedContent);
660 }

else

{
661 FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream(dfosFile);
662 IOUtils.copy(input, output);
663 IOUtils.closeQuietly(input);
664 dfosFile.delete();
665 dfosFile = null;
666 }

667 output.close();

668

669 cachedContent = null;

670 }

This is interesting due to the apparent creation of files. However, after analyzing the state of DiskFileItem after serialization it became clear that arbitrary file creation was not supposed to be intended:

dfos (a type of OutputStream) is transient and therefore it is not serialized. dfos is regenerated by the getOutputStream() call above (which also generates the new File to write out to).

The “repository” (or directory that the file is written to) has to be valid at the time of serialization in order for successful deserialization to occur.

If there is no “cachedContent” then readObject() tries to read in the file from disk.

That filename is always generated via getOutputStream.

Serialized Object Modification

The rules listed above do not take into account that someone might modify the serialized data before it is deserialized. Three important elements get serialized that we can modify:

The repository path (aka the directory that the file is read/written from).

If there is cachedContent (i.e. data that didn’t get written to the file) then that gets serialized

If there is no cachedContent (i.e. all data was written to disk) the full path to the output file exists.

The threshold value that controls if “cachedContent” is written to disk or not.

Modifying these three elements in the serialized object gives us the ability to:

Create files wherever we have permission on the system. The caveat here is that we only have control of the file path and not the final filename.

Copy the contents of files from one file on the system to a location we specify (again we only control the directory path and not the filename). This will also attempt to delete the file we copy from.. so be careful.

# [R4] Apache Wicket DiskFileItem Java Deserialization Remote File Manipulation

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

[Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) is "an open source, component oriented, server-side, Java web application framework." Currently, main development of Wicket is done on the 8.x branch. However, Wicket’s website indicates the current release is listed as 7.3.0 and they [continue to offer 6.23.0 as well as 1.5.14](http://wicket.apache.org/start/download.html).

The Issue

Wicket 6.x contains an implementation of a [Java Class called “`DiskFileItem`”](https://github.com/apache/wicket/blob/wicket-6.x/wicket-util/src/main/java/org/apache/wicket/util/upload/DiskFileItem.java) that is nearly identical to the Commons Upload previously disclosed in [TRA-2016-12](/security/research/tra-2016-12). The only real difference being that the Commons Upload version has been updated to address issues such as [CVE-2013-2186](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-2186/) where the Wicket version has not. Fortunately, most (if not all) JVM will catch this attack so it no longer needs to be explicitly checked for as done in Commons Fileupload. Interestingly, `DiskFileItem` was purged from the 7.x branch back in 2014 as a result of the [WICKET-5503](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5503) ticket as seen in [commit 99fcd91](https://github.com/apache/wicket/commit/99fcd91fe8c3568750f65e7ed830c62b5d46cdaf). The developers correctly identified that tracking security updates in Commons FileUpload was too difficult (since they already missed the update to DiskFileItem).

Can This Be Used In Deserialization Attacks?

Of course! As a quick proof of concept, Tenable created a new payload in `ysoserial` and it is almost an exact copy/paste job of the [FileUpload1 payload](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/FileUpload1.java) but uses `wicket-util`. This allows an attacker to add, move, and delete files that Apache DiskFileItem can. Additionally, if an older Java VM is running, the attacker can control the filename as well, since the NULL byte check doesn't exist. In that case, the ability to name and place a custom file can lead to remote code execution.

Note that the CVSSv2 score downplays the severity of this issue due to the academic nature of the scoring system. Worst case scenario, this can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution in some cases through several actions.

---

On 2016-11-25, the Wicket team contacted us again and mentioned that they missed an important point in our original report to them: "*Protect against null byte attacks*". Pedro Santos from the Wicket team dug into this even further and committed additional fixes and write-up. His analysis concludes this is specific to Wicket and had CVE-2016-6793 assigned for it. More details will be published via Wicket's page on this issue in the near future.

### Solution

The Apache Wicket team has released versions 6.24.0 and 1.5.16 that resolve this issue.

# [R1] Novell NetIQ Sentinel Commons DiskFileItem RMI Java Deserialization Remote File Creation / Manipulation

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

On March 4, 2016, Novell released a patch for NetIQ Sentinel 7.4 SP1 (Sentinel 7.4.1.0) Build 2512 that fixed “Java Deserialization” [1]. The “fix” however, appears to have simply upgraded Apache Commons Collections to 3.2 where dangerous objects are not deserializable by default. This means that NetIQ is still open to other deserialization attacks.

Apache Commons FileUpload contains an object called `DiskFileItem`, which is normally harmless. However, the object can be modified after it is serialized to behave in ways that were not intended. Specifically we can modify `DiskFileItem` to:

1. Create a new file anywhere the Java process has permission.
2. Write anything we would like to that new file.
3. We can also move (copy and delete) any file on the remote system that we have permission to.

There are two limitations though:

1. We don’t control the filename. This is generated by `DiskFileItem` class as “`upload_$uuid_$counter.tmp`.
2. Files are created using the `File.createTempFile()` interface. That means the lifetime of the file is totally dependent on the usage of `deleteOnExit()`, how long the JVM runs, and if it is moved after creation (If the move is done by the exploit then it will still be deleted. However, if the move is done by the `InvokerTransformer` exploit then it will not be deleted). It is our observation that files live for ~2 minutes when created by NetIQ Sentinel.

Proof of Concept

NetIQ Sentinel exposes RMI through TCP port 1099. Using this interface a remote unauthenticated attacker can deserialize a `DiskFileItem`. This allows an attacker to perform a variety of actions. The most obvious is that the attacker now has control of all files owned by `novell:novell`. There are a lot of files within the `/var/opt/novell/sentinel` directory structure that are interesting. Specifically, `/var/opt/novell/sentinel/3rdparty/mongodb/` and `/var/opt/novell/sentinel/3rdparty/postgresql/` contain a large amount of data important to Sentinel. An attacker even has the power to delete the table containing authentication information which then denies access to everyone. Another interesting attack is deleting the "events" (think like Snort warnings) database to hide malicious activity on the network.

Tenable has created a proof-of-concept NASL script that connects to the RMI port and sends the DiskFileItem object. We also had to create a Python version of the exploit for the haters. The result of the attack is a new file in `/tmp/` with the contents “`hello`”. The new file has the permissions of user “`novell`”.

### Solution

Novell has released Sentinel Server 7.4.3 that hopefully mitigates this issues.
