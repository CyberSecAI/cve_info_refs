Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the `date_select.php` file of the "e-search" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `$_GET["date-from"]` and `$_GET["date-to"]` parameters are directly echoed back into the HTML without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, which means that malicious script is injected into a vulnerable web application through a user-supplied request, and then the script is reflected back to the user in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `date-from` or `date-to` parameters, which would then be executed in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  An attacker could steal user cookies, leading to session hijacking.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the page presented to the user.
*   **Phishing:** Redirect the user to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Injection:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request by manipulating the `date-from` or `date-to` parameters in the URL.
*   **Specifically crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `date-from` parameter which will then be executed in victim's browser when they visit the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to be aware that the e-search plugin is installed on the target WordPress site and that the `date_select.php` is vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Construct Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL that contains the malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack relies on tricking a user to visit the crafted malicious URL which will execute the XSS payload in their browser.

**Exploit Code Example:**

The provided exploit code demonstrates a basic payload injection through the `date-from` parameter:

```
http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/e-search/tmpl/date_select.php?date-from="><script>alert(1);</script><"
```

This payload injects a JavaScript `alert(1)` into the page which would be executed in the user's browser when the page is accessed.
