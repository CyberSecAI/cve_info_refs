Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the `new-year-firework` WordPress plugin. The plugin directly echoes values from the `$_GET` array into the HTML output without proper encoding or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the direct inclusion of unsanitized user-provided data from the `$_GET` parameters (`text`, `url`, and `music`) into various HTML contexts:
  - `<title>` tag
  - `meta` description tag
  - `<script>` tag's `src` attribute
  - `<h1>` tag
  - JavaScript variable initialization
  - `<a>` tag's `href` attribute
  - `<input>` tag's `value` attribute
  - `<audio>` tag's `src` attribute

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the context of a victim's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Defacing the website
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include malicious JavaScript code in the `text`, `url`, or `music` parameters.
- An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on a specially crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious payloads in the mentioned parameters.
- They need to be able to persuade a victim to visit the crafted URL.
- No special position or access to the server is required, the vulnerability is client-side.
