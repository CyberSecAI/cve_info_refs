Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `recipes-writer` WordPress plugin's `admin-recipes.php` file not sanitizing the `page` parameter from the GET request before embedding it into the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The unsanitized `$_GET['page']` value is directly echoed back into the HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the page. This can lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user (if logged in).
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL with a malicious `page` parameter. For example:
    `http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/recipes-writer/admin-recipes.php?page="><script>alert(1);</script><"`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious `page` parameter.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to click on the crafted link. The user must be logged in to the wordpress admin panel for a successful attack.
- The vulnerability exists in a file within a plugin directory, suggesting the user/victim must have access to wordpress admin panel.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code shows the injection of `<script>alert(1);</script>`, which is a standard XSS test.
- The vulnerability exists in the `admin-recipes.php` file of the `recipes-writer` plugin.
- The plugin has been closed and is not available for download, therefore it is unlikely that there are many vulnerable systems at this time.
- The vulnerability appears on lines 54, 61, and 62 of the file `admin-recipes.php`
