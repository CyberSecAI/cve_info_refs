  ],
  "description": "A security Bypass vulnerability exists in the FcgidPassHeader Proxy in mod_fcgid through 2016-07-07.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the `mod_fcgid` module's handling of the 'Proxy' header in HTTP requests. Specifically, it allows the `FcgidPassHeader` directive to pass the `Proxy` header from the client request to the CGI environment as `HTTP_PROXY`. This can be exploited to manipulate the behavior of CGI applications that rely on the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable for proxy configurations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Security Bypass",
      "Improper handling of client-supplied data",
      "Exposure of server-side environment variables to client-controlled data"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use this flaw to redirect the application's outbound HTTP traffic through an attacker-controlled proxy server. This can lead to various attacks including data interception, modification, and denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "HTTP Request manipulation"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send an HTTP request to a server using mod_fcgid. A low privileged account is sufficient.",
     "additionalNotes": "This vulnerability is closely related to the 'httpoxy' vulnerability (CVE-2016-5387) but is specific to mod_fcgid. It is also tracked under CVE-2016-1000102, which was later marked as a duplicate of CVE-2016-5387."
