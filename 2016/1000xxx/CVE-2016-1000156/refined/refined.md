Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000156:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2015-1000000) in the MailCWP WordPress plugin. The fix attempts to block direct uploads of PHP files by checking the file extension. However, the check is insufficient because it only filters the ".php" extension and does not address alternative PHP extensions like `.php[3-5]`, `.pht`, or `.phtml`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate file extension filtering:** The plugin's upload functionality only checks for the ".php" extension, leaving other PHP-executable extensions vulnerable.
- **Unrestricted file upload:** Authenticated users can upload arbitrary files to the WordPress installation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** By uploading a file with a PHP-executable extension, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the WordPress installation.
- **Compromise of the WordPress site:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `mailcwp-upload.php` script.
- **File upload:** The malicious file is included in the request using the `file` parameter.
- **Cookie authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the WordPress site.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress website.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to upload a PHP shell file using `curl`.
- The plugin has been closed as of September 22, 2015 and is not available for download.
- The advisory explicitly states this is an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-1000000.
- The plugin's version is 1.100
