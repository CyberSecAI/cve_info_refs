Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000130:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `title_az.php` file within the e-search WordPress plugin. Specifically, the code at line 44 uses an unsanitized `$_GET["title_az"]` parameter directly in an HTML input field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS. User-supplied input via the `title_az` GET parameter is reflected back to the user without proper sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This allows for a wide range of attacks, including:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Displaying misleading or malicious content.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Keylogging or other information gathering

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload within the `title_az` parameter.
- An attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the crafted URL to execute the exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to click on the URL. The attack vector is reflected, so no changes are needed on the server itself for the exploit to work.

**Additional Details**
- The provided information indicates that the plugin was closed and is no longer available for download.
- The exploit code shows the general form of the attack: `http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/e-search/tmpl/title_az.php?title_az="><script>alert(1);</script><"` where `[target]` must be replaced with the URL of the affected WordPress site.
