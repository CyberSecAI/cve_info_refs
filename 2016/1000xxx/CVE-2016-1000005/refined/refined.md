Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-1000005:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The provided content includes a commit from the Facebook HHVM repository which mentions fixing parameter types for mcrypt_get_block_size() to match PHP. This strongly suggests that this commit is related to the fix for the vulnerability. Additionally, the Facebook page includes a link to a security advisory for CVE-2016-1000005 which reinforces that this is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the incorrect parameter type definition of the `mcrypt_get_block_size()` function in HHVM's implementation compared to PHP. Specifically, the `mode` parameter was not correctly defined. This discrepancy could lead to unexpected behavior or potential issues during the execution of the function.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Type Mismatch:** The primary weakness is the mismatch in parameter types between HHVM's `mcrypt_get_block_size` function and the equivalent PHP function. This type mismatch indicates a programming error which can be exploited if an attacker crafts input that doesn't match the function signature.
- **Potential for Undefined Behavior**: Although not explicitly stated, this type mismatch could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect return values if the underlying C++ code relies on the parameter to be a certain type, leading to unexpected control flow or out of bounds access.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

The provided content doesn't go into depth about specific exploits. But, it can be inferred that the impact of this specific vulnerability would be:
- **Incorrect Program Behavior:** The primary impact is incorrect program behavior. Specifically, the block size returned by `mcrypt_get_block_size()` could be incorrect, which may lead to problems using mcrypt functions for encryption and decryption.
- **Potential Denial-of-Service or Memory Corruption:** While not definitively mentioned, type mismatches and incorrect parameter handling can sometimes lead to crashes or memory corruption. If an attacker were able to provide specifically crafted inputs, it may be possible to trigger such a scenario, depending on the underlying C++ implementation.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although not specifically mentioned in this patch, incorrect handling of parameters can potentially lead to information disclosure if the function leaks memory or provides error messages that could be exploited.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector for this vulnerability would likely involve calling the `mcrypt_get_block_size()` function with specific inputs that are valid from PHP's perspective but invalid from HHVM's original implementation.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute PHP or HHVM code that calls the `mcrypt_get_block_size()` function.
-   **Input Control:** The attacker needs some control over the arguments passed to the `mcrypt_get_block_size()` function in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**7. Additional Notes:**
- The commit message explicitly states "Fix param types for mcrypt_get_block_size() to match PHP", reinforcing the nature of the vulnerability as a type mismatch.
- The changes in the provided diffs are related to parameter types, especially in the php function definition where it was changed from `?string $mode = null` to `string $mode`.
- The fix included updating the C++ code, the PHP function definition, as well as the related tests.
