# SQL injection in api\_user\_id usage (?)

* Resolved

  Hi,

  in `lib/shortcode/shortcode.ajax.php`

  you get the api\_user\_id from the GET parameter.

  ```
  function Zotpress_shortcode_AJAX() {
      ...
      $zp_api_user_id = $_GET['api_user_id'];
      ...
      $zp_account = zp_get_account ($wpdb, $zp_api_user_id);
  ```

  You then use that api\_user\_id in the functions `zp_get_account`, `zp_get_accounts` and `zp_clear_cache_for_user` in `lib/request/request.function.php` which do SQL queries with the `wpdb->get_results` function but don’t do `wpdb->prepare` on the input.

  ```
  function zp_get_account ($wpdb, $api_user_id_incoming=false)
  {
      if ($api_user_id_incoming !== false)
          $zp_account = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM
  ".$wpdb->prefix."zotpress WHERE api_user_id='".$api_user
  _id_incoming."'");
  ```

  I might be mistaken but with a brief glimpse I don’t see where the api\_user\_id is validated/sanitized in which case there is an sql injection vulnerability. Am I missing something? Is some wordpress function escaping that user input?

## Description

[Zotpress](http://katieseaborn.com/plugins/ "Zotpress for WordPress") brings publication broadcasting and scholarly blogging to WordPress through [Zotero](http://zotero.org/ "Zotero"), a free, cross-platform reference manager.

#### Features

* Displays your personal and group Zotero items through in-text citations, bibliographies, and searchable libraries
* Supports thumbnail images through WordPress’s Media Library and Open Library
* Supports selective CSS styling via IDs and classes
* Provides a range of additional features, such as allowing visitors to download citations
* And more!

Compatible with Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and IE9. Made with jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery doTimeout, Live Query, OAuth, and [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/ "Open Library").

Special thanks to Joe Alberts for substantial contributions to the code, comprehensive testing, and design ideation. Thanks also to contributors Christopher Cheung, Jason S., Chris Wentzloff, Karljürgen Feuerherm (@feuerherm), Mark Dingemanse (@codeispoetry), Jörg Mechnich (jmechnich@github), Tomas Risberg, @ericcorbett2, and @timtom for their code contributions, testing, and guidance. Finally, my sincere gratitude goes out to all who have donated in support of this plugin.

Please note that this plugin is on semi-hiatus, with updates expected about 1-3 times a year.

#### Requirements

jQuery included in your theme (Zotpress will do this for you if it isn’t already included), and an HTTP request method supported by WordPress enabled on your server: cURL, fopen with Streams (PHP 5), or fsockopen. In your server config file, X-Frame-Options should be set to SAMEORIGIN. Optional: OAuth enabled on your server.

* [![](https://ps.w.org/zotpress/trunk/screenshot-6.jpg?rev=3176262)](https://ps.w.org/zotpress/trunk/screenshot-6.jpg?rev=3176262)

  Allow visitors to search your library by item metadata or tag, or both.

## Installation

1. Install from the `Plugins` page in your WordPress admin panel. Or, download and extract the zip, then manually upload the folder `zotpress` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the `Zotpress` page through the admin menu.
4. Add the Zotero API information for each Zotero account you’d like to use.
5. Use the Zotpress Shortcode option in the Gutenberg editor to serach for items and build a shortcode. Or, look up the keys of items, collections, and tags on the `Browse` page. Or, use the Zotpress Reference Meta Box to generate shortcodes.
6. Place the shortcodes in your blog post or page, or enable the Zotpress sidebar widget. Below are a few examples to get you started. Look at the `Help` page for more examples and the full details about all use options and shortcodes.

#### Shortcode

You can display your Zotero citations in a number of ways. To display a list of five citations from the collection with the key “ZKDTKM3X”, use this shortcode:

> [zotpress collection=”ZKDTKM3X” limit=”5″]

You can also use in-text citations as follows:

> [zotpressInText item=”{U9Z5JTKC,36-45}”]
>
> [zotpressInTextBib]

The first shortcode will display an in-text citation for an item with the key “U9Z5JTKC”, which will look something like this: (Seaborn, 2011, p. 36). The [zotpressInTextBib] will auto-generate a bibliography for all [zotpressInText] shortcodes on the post/page.

Check out the “Help” page on your installation of Zotpress for more information and a full listing of parameters for all shortcodes.

## FAQ

The F.A.Q. can be found on the “Help” page of every Zotpress installation. If you have a question that isn’t answered there, feel free to post a message in the [forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/zotpress "Zotpress forums on WordPress.com").

It is a great pity that attachments (data files, images, notes, etc.) saved in Zotero items cannot be seen and downloaded when using Zotpress.

A very nice plugin, very useful and very effective.
Well written and developed, constantly updated. A little attention is required in the configuration but it is sufficient to carefully read the many contributions in the support area.
I would give six stars if I could 🙂

After many years copying and pasting bibliographies from Zotero and manually correcting them, I’ve finally given Zotpress a try and honestly I don’t know what took me so long! It works great and is quite powerful.
There are still a few things I’d like the plugin to do, e.g.
Set default display options instead of having to specify them in every shortcode (e.g. have htmlwrap=true or sortby=author be the default)
Have the option to wrap bibliography items in list elements instead of div, which may be better for accessibility
Support custom bibliography styles
But even without all that, it’s already a great plugin. Many thanks for developing it!

I like a lot this nice plugin, but I face a major issue : I cannot post anything when the plugin is activated, because it generate an error message each time I try to create a new block : ‘this block encountered en issue and cannot be displayed’
So I have to desactivate it, then modify, then reactivate entering the settings…
