The provided content relates to CVE-2016-1000217.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Zotpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `api_user_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability: The plugin directly uses the `api_user_id` GET parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or using `wpdb->prepare`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, which can lead to:
  - Data breaches: Accessing sensitive data stored in the WordPress database.
  - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data within the database.
  - Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining administrative access to the WordPress site by exploiting vulnerabilities.
  - Website compromise: Taking complete control over the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `lib/shortcode/shortcode.ajax.php` file within the Zotpress plugin, specifically the `Zotpress_shortcode_AJAX` function, and is further exploited in `lib/request/request.function.php` via the `zp_get_account`, `zp_get_accounts`, and `zp_clear_cache_for_user` functions.
- The `api_user_id` is taken from the GET parameter which is accessible to any user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request containing the malicious SQL payload via the `api_user_id` parameter.
