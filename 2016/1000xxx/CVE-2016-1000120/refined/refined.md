Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-1000120:

**CVE-2016-1000120:** SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Huge IT catalog extension v1.0.4 for Joomla

**Root Cause:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input (parameters) when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the extension directly inserts values from `JRequest::getVar()` into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The `message_id` parameter obtained via `$_GET` is directly echoed into an HTML input field without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Several instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in the following files:
    *   `./models/submissions.php`: via `message_id` parameter.
    *   `./models/comment.php`: via `projectId` parameter.
    *   `./models/rating.php`: via `projectId` parameter.
    *   `./models/catalog.php`: via `id` parameter in multiple locations, and via `removeslide` parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   `./views/submissions/tmpl/default.php`: Reflected XSS via the `message_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the Joomla application.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could:
    *   Execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser.
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirect the user to a malicious site.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** By injecting malicious SQL code through vulnerable parameters (`message_id`, `projectId`, `id`, `removeslide`) in HTTP requests.
*   **Reflected XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `message_id` parameter, which, when clicked by an administrator, executes malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker must have access to the Joomla administration panel or have at least manager-level access.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker must trick an administrator into clicking a malicious link.

**Technical Details:**

*   The SQL injection vulnerability is primarily due to the usage of `JRequest::getVar()` and direct embedding of the retrieved values into SQL queries without proper sanitization and parameterization.
*   The XSS vulnerability occurs because the value of the `message_id` GET parameter is reflected in the HTML without proper encoding.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory indicates that the vendor was notified on 2015-07-17, suggesting a significant delay between notification and the publication of the advisory (2016-07-17)
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to use sqlmap to exploit the SQL injection and a sample URL to demonstrate the XSS attack.
*   The affected extension was unpublished due to "Broken Links" suggesting the extension is no longer supported or available for download.
