Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000126:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the `css.php` file of the `admin-font-editor` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `size` and `font` parameters passed via the `$_GET` array are directly echoed back into the HTML output without any form of sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Because the plugin directly reflects user-supplied `size` and `font` parameters in the output without sanitizing, it allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the page viewed by a victim. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities including:
  - **Session hijacking:** Stealing cookies to impersonate the user.
  - **Phishing:** Redirecting the victim to a fake login page or other malicious sites.
  - **Malware distribution:**  Loading malicious scripts to infect the victim's computer.
  - **Defacement:** Altering the visual appearance of the webpage.
  - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive user data through the injected script.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL. An attacker can create a URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `size` or `font` parameters. When a victim visits this URL, the script is executed within their browser, within the context of the vulnerable web page.
- The provided exploit shows this as: `http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/admin-font-editor/css.php?size="><script>alert(1);</script><"`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload, to be visited by the victim.
- No special privileges are needed on the target system. The attacker just needs to entice the victim to click on the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin `admin-font-editor` is marked as closed and unavailable for download as of October 1, 2014. This indicates that it is no longer maintained and, thus, the vulnerability is unlikely to be patched.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.8 of the plugin.
- The exploit code provided is an untested, auto-generated example that uses the `size` parameter; other parameters might be vulnerable as well.
