Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied input within the "Huge IT catalog" extension for Joomla. Specifically, the extension fails to sanitize or properly validate GET parameters before using them in SQL queries, leading to SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, the extension directly outputs user-controlled input, leading to Reflected XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities were identified within the extension's files:
    *   `./models/submissions.php`: Vulnerable via the `message_id` parameter.
    *   `./models/comment.php`: Vulnerable via the `projectId` parameter.
    *   `./models/rating.php`: Vulnerable via the `projectId` parameter.
    *   `./models/catalog.php`: Vulnerable via the `id` parameter (multiple instances).
    *   `./models/catalog.php`: Vulnerable via the `removeslide` parameter.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   `./views/submissions/tmpl/default.php`: Vulnerable via the `message_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
    *   Injected SQL could allow for complete database takeover.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially leading to:
        *   Session hijacking
        *   Redirection to malicious sites
        *   Defacement of the webpage
        *   Stealing of sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Exploited by crafting malicious URLs containing specially crafted values in the vulnerable parameters (`message_id`, `projectId`, `id`, `removeslide`).
*   **Reflected XSS:** Exploited by crafting malicious URLs containing javascript code in the `message_id` parameter, which is reflected back to the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be logged in with at least manager-level access to the administrative panel to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*  **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to be logged in with at least manager-level access to the administrative panel to exploit the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory indicates the vendor was notified on 2015-07-17 but does not specify if a patch is available.
*   The provided exploit code for SQL Injection uses `sqlmap` with a cookie for authentication.
*   The advisory provides a specific XSS payload example.
