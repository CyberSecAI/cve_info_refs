Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000133:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the plugin's `popup.php` file directly echoing an unsanitized `$_GET['ajaxurl']` parameter into a JavaScript variable within the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not sanitize the `ajaxurl` parameter before embedding it into the JavaScript code, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, potentially leading to:
  - Account compromise (e.g., by stealing session cookies).
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
  - Defacing the website
  - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `ajaxurl` parameter, an attacker can trick a user into visiting the URL, executing the malicious script within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- No special access to the target WordPress installation is required.
- The attacker would likely need to socially engineer the victim into clicking the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerable code is located in `./forget-about-shortcode-buttons/assets/js/fasc-buttons/popup.php`
* The vulnerable line is line 38, which outputs the `ajaxurl` parameter in a JavaScript variable assignment.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.2 of the plugin.
* The provided exploit code in the Vapidlabs advisory clearly demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a `<script>` tag that executes an alert box.
