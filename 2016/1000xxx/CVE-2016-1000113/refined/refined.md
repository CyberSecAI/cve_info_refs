Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `getPropertie` function in `administrator/components/com_gallery/models/gallery.php` directly incorporates the user-supplied `id` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `default.php` template in `administrator/components/com_gallery/views/gallery/tmpl/` echoes the `$_GET['id']` parameter directly into an HTML attribute, enabling XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization when constructing database queries.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to direct output of user-controlled input in HTML context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or potentially gain control of the server.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the `id` parameter in a request to the `/administrator/index.php` with the `com_gallery` component.
    *   Specifically, the `administrator/index.php?option=com_gallery&view=gallery&id=[SQLi]` URL is vulnerable.
*  **XSS:**
     * The XSS is triggered via `index.php?option=com_gallery&view=video&tmpl=component&pid=[XSS Payload]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be logged into the Joomla administration panel to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Joomla instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates both SQL injection and XSS attack vectors using the `id` parameter in the request.
*   The affected component is "Gallery Pro" for Joomla.
*   The vendor was notified, but the content does not indicate if a fix was released.
