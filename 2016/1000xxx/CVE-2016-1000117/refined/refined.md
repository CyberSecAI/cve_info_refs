Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-1000117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the `Huge-IT Slideshow` extension's PHP files. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unsanitized user input is reflected in the HTML output, specifically through the `id` parameter, which allows injecting malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `getPropertie()`, `getImageByID()`, and `save()` functions in `./models/slideshow.php`, along with other similar functions in `./models/fields/slideshow.php`, `./models/slideshows.php`, `./models/video.php`, `./models/forms/general.php`, and `./models/general.php` are vulnerable.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The `./views/slideshow/tmpl/default.php` file reflects the unsanitized `id` parameter within the `href` attribute of a link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
    *   They could also potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to the compromise of the entire application.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to actions such as:
        *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
        *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
        *   Defacing the website.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the HTTP requests made to the vulnerable functions of the Huge-IT Slideshow extension.
*  **Reflected XSS:** The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the HTTP requests made to the slideshow view, specifically the `index.php?option=com_slideshow&view=slideshow&id=` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker must be logged into the Joomla administrative panel with at least manager-level access.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to convince a user to click on a specially crafted link that contains the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory provides specific code snippets where the SQL injection vulnerabilities are present.
*   The advisory also provides an example SQLmap command to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability, and an example URL to exploit the reflected XSS.
*   The vulnerable version of the Huge-IT Slideshow extension is v1.0.4.
