Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-1000114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter in the `administrator/components/com_gallery/models/gallery.php` file is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

*   **XSS:** The `id` parameter in the URL is reflected in the HTML output in `administrator/components/com_gallery/views/gallery/tmpl/default.php` file via `echo $_GET['id']` making the application vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `getPropertie()` function of `administrator/components/com_gallery/models/gallery.php`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS because the `id` parameter from the URL is reflected in the HTML output in `administrator/components/com_gallery/views/gallery/tmpl/default.php` without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or extract data.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, which can be executed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL, specifically the `administrator/index.php?option=com_gallery&view=gallery&id=` part to inject SQL code. For example:
    `http://192.168.0.125/administrator/index.php?option=com_gallery&view=gallery&id=SQLiHERE`
*   **XSS:** The attacker can inject JavaScript code using the `id` parameter. For example:
    `http://192.168.0.125/administrator/index.php?option=com_gallery&view=gallery&id=1--%20%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be logged into Joomla to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with manipulated parameters to the vulnerable Joomla instance.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerable component is the `com_gallery` extension for Joomla.
*  The identified vulnerable files are:
    *   `administrator/components/com_gallery/models/gallery.php`
    *   `administrator/components/com_gallery/views/gallery/tmpl/default.php`
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates both SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory mentions that the vendor was notified on 2016-07-15.
* The Joomla extension was unpublished due to broken links.
