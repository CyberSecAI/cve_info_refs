  "CVE-2016-1000344": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier DHIES implementation allowed the use of ECB mode.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The use of ECB mode in the DHIES implementation. ECB mode is considered unsafe for encryption.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or the addition or modification of data.",
      "Attack vectors": "Network attack.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept, inject, or modify network traffic, and exploit the vulnerable component of the affected product."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier DHIES implementation allowed the use of ECB mode.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper validation of DH public keys, allowing use of ECB mode. Support for ECB mode was removed from the provider.",
