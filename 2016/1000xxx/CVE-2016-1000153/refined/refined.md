Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000153:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `popup-insert-help.php` file in the tidio-gallery WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `galleryId` parameter received through the GET request (`$_GET['galleryId']`) is used directly within the output without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Unsanitized user input, specifically the `galleryId` parameter, is directly embedded within the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the user's account.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the webpage.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or initiating downloads of malware.
    *   **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or by making requests to internal APIs using the user's cookies.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `galleryId` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that includes the malicious JavaScript code in the `galleryId` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to get the victim to visit this crafted URL (e.g., by sending the link via email, social media, or embedding it on a website) on a vulnerable WordPress site using the tidio-gallery plugin.

**Additional details:**

* The provided exploit code `http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/tidio-gallery/popup-insert-help.php?galleryId="><script>alert(1);</script><"` demonstrates a simple XSS attack, where the `galleryId` parameter is set to a string that will execute an alert box with a value of 1.
* The plugin has been closed and is not available for download since September 7, 2014.
