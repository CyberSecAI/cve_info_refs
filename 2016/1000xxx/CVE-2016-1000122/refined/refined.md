Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper input sanitization within the Huge IT Slider Joomla extension. Specifically, the extension uses `JRequest::getVar()` to retrieve user-supplied data (`id`, `removeslide`) from the HTTP request, and then uses that data in database queries without proper escaping or sanitization. This lack of sanitization leads to both XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Location:** `./admin/views/slider/tmpl/default.php`
    *   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `id` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Details:** The code directly outputs the value of the `id` parameter within an HTML `href` attribute: `<a href="index.php?option=com_slider&view=video&tmpl=component&pid=<?php echo $_GET['id']; ?>"`. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by manipulating the `id` parameter, which will then be executed in the context of the user's browser.

2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Location:** `./admin/models/slider.php`
    *   **Vulnerable Parameters:**  `id`, and `removeslide` from the HTTP request
    *  **Details:** The code constructs SQL queries using string concatenation with values retrieved from the `id` variable. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the `id` and `removeslide` parameters to perform database manipulation, including data extraction or modification. The following locations are vulnerable:
        *   Lines 53, 69, 117, 133: `slider_id=`.
        *  Line 182 `id =`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to actions like session hijacking, stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or complete control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a payload in the `id` parameter. The user must access the URL (typically a logged-in administrator with access to the admin panel).
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL, with SQL injection strings in the `id` and `removeslide` parameters.  The user must access the URL (typically a logged-in administrator with access to the admin panel).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have at least manager level access or access to the administrative panel of the Joomla site. This is required to access the vulnerable files and trigger the exploit.
*   The attacker can also socially engineer a logged-in administrator to click on a malicious link.

**Additional Information:**

* The advisory also mentions the specific vulnerable file and lines of code in the `admin/models/slider.php` file with the SQL injection flaw.
* The provided exploit code includes example URLs demonstrating both the XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* The affected version of the extension is `v1.0.9`.
