Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discovered in Ruckus access points, although the content does not explicitly reference CVE-2016-1000213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** Lack of input sanitization in the ping diagnostic tool allows for arbitrary command execution.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Specific string in the request leads to '200 OK' responses, bypassing authentication checks.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Requesting a specific page over SSL causes the management interface to become unavailable.
*  **Information Disclosure:** The device's serial number is exposed through the HTTP server.
* **Excessive memory consumption:** Authenticated requests for a particular page trigger high memory usage, causing the HTTP server to reload and potentially disrupting other services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The ping diagnostic tool does not sanitize input, making it susceptible to command injection.
*   **Inadequate Authentication:** The system fails to properly authenticate requests, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The HTTP interface doesn't use CSRF tokens.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Specific requests can cause denial of service by overwhelming the system's memory.
*   **Information Leakage:**  The serial number of the device is exposed through HTTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges via command injection, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and potentially gain access to sensitive information, control the device's configuration.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can make the management interface unavailable, disrupting services.
*   **Information Gathering:** Attackers can gather device information like the serial number which could be used in social engineering or further attacks.
*   **CSRF attacks:** The excessive memory consumption vulnerability is exploitable through GET requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** Attackers can intercept and manipulate network traffic if they compromise the access point.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:**  All vulnerabilities are exploited through crafted HTTP requests to the device's web interface.
*   **Command Injection:**  The ping diagnostic tool is accessed through an HTTP request containing malicious parameters.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  By inserting a particular string within a request, access is gained without proper credentials.
*   **DoS:** Attackers send a crafted request via HTTP or HTTPS.
* **CSRF:** The memory exhaustion vulnerability can be triggered via CSRF attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to have network access to the vulnerable Ruckus access point.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** Attackers must be able to craft HTTP requests and understand web server interactions.
*   **Command Injection Knowledge:** Attackers need to know how to craft command injection payloads.

**Additional Information:**
* The report highlights the lack of security in "enterprise-class" hardware, comparing it to issues found in consumer-grade devices.
* Ruckus's initial lack of response to vulnerability reports is noted, suggesting communication and disclosure process issues.
*  The vulnerability was initially discovered in an older firmware but was found to persist in the latest version, indicating lack of proper security updates.
* The vendor claimed the vulnerabilities only exist in standalone mode, but this claim has not been validated in the report.

**CVE Relevance:**

Although this article details several vulnerabilities found in Ruckus devices, it doesn't directly reference CVE-2016-1000213. However, the types of vulnerabilities described, particularly the command injection via ping, are common in embedded devices and are often assigned CVEs. Therefore, this content may describe the same vulnerability covered under another CVE or could have led to the discovery of CVE-2016-1000213, but without a direct link, this cannot be confirmed.
