Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000142:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the `css.php` file of the "MW Font Changer" WordPress plugin (parsi-font). Specifically, the `$_GET['size']` parameter is directly echoed back to the user's browser without any filtering or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `size` parameter. This injected code is then reflected back and executed in the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
*   **Website Defacement:** Malicious scripts can modify the appearance of the web page.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing sites or sites hosting malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `size` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker might distribute this crafted URL through social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing emails) to trick users into clicking the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the "MW Font Changer" plugin is installed on a target WordPress site and be aware of the vulnerable `css.php` file.
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with the malicious XSS payload in the `size` parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack relies on a user clicking the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content states that the vulnerability was fixed in version 4.3 of the plugin.
*   The content indicates that the `font` parameter might also be vulnerable, but focuses on the `size` parameter as the primary vulnerability.
