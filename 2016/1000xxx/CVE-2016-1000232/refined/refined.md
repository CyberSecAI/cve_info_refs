```
{
  "Root cause": "The tough-cookie module is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service. A specially crafted HTTP header with many semicolons could cause excessive CPU consumption while parsing the cookie.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by making an application using tough-cookie consume an excessive amount of CPU, leading to performance degradation or application unavailability.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a crafted HTTP request with a large Cookie header containing many semicolons."
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application utilizing the vulnerable version of the tough-cookie library.",
   "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is caused by a vulnerable regular expression within the tough-cookie library that is used to parse the Cookie header. When a long string of semicolons is present in the header, the regex engine's backtracking mechanism causes the event loop to block for an excessive amount of time and can lead to a denial of service."
