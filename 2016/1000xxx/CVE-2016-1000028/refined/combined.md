# [R5] Nessus 6.8 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus has been found to contain four vulnerabilities. The first is in the third-party library, libexpat, and the other three are native to Nessus:

* CVE-2016-0718 - The Expat XML Parser (expat/libexpat) contains an overflow condition that is triggered as user-supplied input is not properly validated when handling malformed input documents. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code. (9.0 / 6.7 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C))
* CVE-2016-1000028 / Tenable ID 5198 - A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that requires user-level authentication to the Nessus UI. [4.0 / 3.1 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C)]
* CVE-2016-1000029 / Tenable ID 5218 - A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that requires admin-level authentication to the Nessus UI, and would only potentially impact other admins. [2.1 / 1.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C)]
* CVE-2016-1000029 / Tenable ID 5269 - A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that requires admin-level authentication to the Nessus UI, and would only potentially impact other admins. [2.1 / 1.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C)]
* NO-CVE-YET / Tenable ID 5268 - A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that requires admin-level authentication to the Nessus UI, and would only potentially impact other admins. [2.1 / 1.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C)]

Note that the overall CVSSv2 score assigned to this advisory represents the libexpat issue. The XSS issues have individual scores for customers to better understand the risks. Nessus plugin nessus\_tns\_2016\_11.nasl (92465) has been released to detect these issues.

Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that Nessus be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus version 6.8 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated libexpat library (2.1.1), and resolves the cross-site scripting issues.

To update your Nessus installation, follow these steps:

* Download the appropriate installation file to the system hosting Nessus Professional or Nessus Manager, available at the Tenable Support Portal (<https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=200>)
* Stop the Nessus service.
* Install according to your operating system procedures.
* Restart the Nessus service.

*This page contains information regarding security vulnerabilities that may impact Tenable's products. This may include issues specific to our software, or due to the use of third-party libraries within our software. Tenable strongly encourages users to ensure that they upgrade or apply relevant patches in a timely manner.*

*Tenable takes product security very seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability in one of our products, we ask that you please work with us to quickly resolve it in order to protect customers.
Tenable believes in responding quickly to such reports, maintaining communication with researchers, and providing a solution in short order.*
