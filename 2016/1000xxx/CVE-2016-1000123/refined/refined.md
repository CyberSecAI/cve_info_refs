Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1000123

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ajax_url.php` file of the Huge-IT Video Gallery plugin for Joomla. Specifically, the `galleryid` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without being validated or sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89).  An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `galleryid` POST parameter, which is then executed by the database.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users, meaning no login or special privileges are required.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information stored in the database, including user credentials, and other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, the attacker might gain complete control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `ajax_url.php`.
- **`galleryid` parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `galleryid` POST parameter.
- **`task` parameter:** The `task` parameter should be set to `load_videos_content` to reach the vulnerable code block.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla site.
- **No Authentication:** No prior authentication or user account is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of the vulnerable `galleryid` parameter in the `ajax_url.php` file.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is in `ajax_url.php`, specifically lines 49, 54. The `galleryid` parameter is taken directly from the `$_POST` array and is used in the WHERE clause of an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.

```php
    49  $idofgallery=$_POST['galleryid'];
    ...
    54  $query->where('videogallery_id ='.$idofgallery);
```

The exploit code provided in the advisory demonstrates how to use `sqlmap` to exploit the vulnerability.  The following are examples of payloads that can be injected:
- Error-based: `page=1&galleryid=-3390 OR 1 GROUP BY CONCAT(0x716b766271,(SELECT (CASE WHEN (2575=2575) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)),0x7170767071,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2)) HAVING MIN(0)#&task=load_videos_content&perpage=20&linkbutton=2`
- Time-based blind: `page=1&galleryid=(CASE WHEN (5952=5952) THEN SLEEP(5) ELSE 5952 END)&task=load_videos_content&perpage=20&linkbutton=2`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor released a fix in version 1.1.0 of the plugin.
- This is an example of a classic SQL injection vulnerability due to improper input validation.
