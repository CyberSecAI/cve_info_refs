Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `channel` parameter in the `mychannel.php` file of the HDW-Tube WordPress plugin. The plugin directly embeds the value of the `channel` GET parameter into the HTML output without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the reflected XSS vulnerability. The plugin takes user-supplied input (`channel` GET parameter) and reflects it back in the HTML output without any sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `channel` parameter. When a user visits the crafted URL, the malicious script will execute in the user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user.
*   **Website Defacement:** The injected JavaScript could be used to modify the content of the page, leading to website defacement.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could use the injected JavaScript to redirect users to malicious websites, distributing malware.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could use the injected JavaScript to display a fake login form, potentially stealing user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL using the HTTP GET method. The attacker would need to entice a victim to click on the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to create a URL containing the malicious JavaScript code in the `channel` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick users into clicking on the malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the following code snippets within `mychannel.php`:

```php
290: var channelid = '<?php echo $_GET['channel']?>';
299: var channelid = '<?php echo $_GET['channel']?>';
422: $hdwt.post(location.href,{comment_message:mess,comment_name:myname,comment_image:myimage,channel_id_comment:'<?php echo $_GET['channel'];?>'}, function( data ) {
```
The `$GET['channel']` parameter is echoed directly into javascript code or as a POST parameter, without being sanitized/encoded.

**Exploit Code:**
The provided example exploit URL is:
```
http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/hdw-tube/mychannel.php?channel="><script>alert(1);</script><"
```
This URL demonstrates the injection of a simple JavaScript alert box, proving the existence of the XSS vulnerability.
