Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2016-1000121**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the Huge IT Joomla Slider extension. Specifically, it involves both a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability and multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The `id` variable in `./admin/views/slider/tmpl/default.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL Injection occur in `./admin/models/slider.php` due to unsanitized input from the `id` variable obtained via `JRequest::getVar('id')` being directly used in SQL queries. This happens in lines 53, 69, 117, 133 and 182.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, potentially stealing user sessions, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing other actions within the context of the victim's browser session.
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries to potentially access, modify, or delete database information, and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **XSS:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the `id` parameter in the URL.
    *   **SQL Injection:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `id` or `removeslide` parameter in the URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs at least "manager level access or access to the administrative panel" to exploit these vulnerabilities in the Joomla backend.

**Summary of vulnerabilities**
