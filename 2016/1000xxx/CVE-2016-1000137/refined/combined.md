…free map tools aroud here. For me, there´s no need for the premium version, the free one is just fine.
The support is outstanding, developers are listening and agile.

this plugin is easy to use and has all the features we were looking for and the premium upgrade is reasonably priced. i tried 3-4 other map plugins first that all fell short of my expectations.
on top of a great plugin the support is amazing–super responsive and helpful!
thank you Hero Plugins–love your logo too!
