Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the `hero-maps-pro` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `v` and `p` parameters from the GET request are directly embedded into the HTML output without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS because it echoes unsanitized input from the `$_GET['v']` and `$_GET['p']` parameters directly into the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page that is served to a user of the WordPress site. This can lead to:
    - Stealing user cookies or session information, allowing for account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website or displaying phishing content.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user, if the user is logged into the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL with the malicious JavaScript payload embedded in the `v` parameter.
  - Example: `http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/hero-maps-pro/views/dashboard/index.php?v="><script>alert(1);</script><"`
-  The `p` parameter is also vulnerable using the same method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs and have a victim visit these crafted URLs on a website using the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional notes:**

- The provided content from Vapidlabs indicates that the vulnerability exists in `hero-maps-pro` version 2.1.0, specifically within the `/hero-maps-pro/views/dashboard/index.php` file, lines 4 and 9.
- The plugin is no longer available for download on WordPress.org, as it was closed on May 4, 2016. However, users who have previously downloaded and installed this plugin are still at risk.
- The Vapidlabs advisory confirms this is CVE-2016-1000137.
- The exploit code provided is an example that uses the `v` parameter.
