Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-1000116

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Joomla extension "Huge-IT Portfolio Gallery" is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input.
- Specifically, the `id` parameter, obtained through `JRequest::getVar('id')`, is directly injected into an SQL query without any sanitization. This happens in the `getPropertie()` function in the file `administrator/components/com_portfoliogallery/models/portfoliogallery.php` at line 59.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, or performing other unauthorized actions on the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access all data stored in the database, including usernames, passwords, customer data, or other sensitive information handled by the extension.
- **Data Manipulation:**  An attacker could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data loss, corruption, or other issues.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, an attacker could execute system-level commands and take control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter `id` is passed via the HTTP GET method in the URL, making it easy to manipulate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in with at least manager-level access or have access to the administrative panel of the Joomla website.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable file: `administrator/components/com_portfoliogallery/models/portfoliogallery.php`
- Vulnerable function: `getPropertie()`
- Vulnerable line: 59 `$query->where('portfolio_id=' . $id_cat);`
- The SQL query is built using string concatenation with unsanitized input `$id_cat`, which is obtained from the `id` GET parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory also mentions a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2016-1000115), but this description focuses on the SQL injection (CVE-2016-1000116) vulnerability as requested.
- The provided exploit code utilizes sqlmap to automate the process of exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
