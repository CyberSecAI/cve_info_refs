  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from Yaws's failure to address namespace conflicts as defined in RFC 3875 section 4.1.18. Specifically, it does not sanitize or filter the `Proxy` header in HTTP requests.",
    "weaknesses": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `Proxy` header, where the server creates an `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable based on the user-supplied value. This environment variable can then be used by the CGI application.",
    "impact": "An attacker can redirect a CGI application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server. This allows them to intercept and potentially modify requests, view sensitive information, reply with malformed data or hold connections open, leading to a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests that contain a malicious `Proxy` header.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable server hosting CGI applications. No special privileges are required."
