Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Joomla Huge-IT Slideshow extension (version 1.0.4) has multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities due to unsanitized parameters passed to database queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter used in `getPropertie()` and `getImageByID()` functions in `slideshow.php` and other similar functions are vulnerable.
*   Additionally, a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in `default.php` due to lack of sanitization of the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The code directly incorporates user-supplied input (specifically, the `id` parameter retrieved via `JRequest::getVar('id')`) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. The following functions are specifically identified as vulnerable:
    *   `getPropertie()` in `slideshow.php`
    *    `getImageByID()` in `slideshow.php`
    *    `save()` in `slideshow.php`
    *    Functions in the following files are also vulnerable: `slideshow.php`, `fields/slideshow.php`, `slideshows.php`, `video.php`, `forms/general.php`, and `general.php`.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The `id` parameter in `default.php` is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Unauthorized data access or modification
    *   Potential database takeover
    *   Data breaches
*   **Reflected XSS:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Phishing attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in HTTP requests sent to the vulnerable functions.  For example, by crafting a malicious SQL payload to the `id` parameter in  `index.php?option=com_slideshow&view=slideshow&id=*`
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can craft a malicious link with a payload in the `id` parameter to the vulnerable script, and send to a user with administrator access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker must be logged in with at least manager-level access or have access to the administrative panel to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Reflected XSS:**  The attacker needs to entice an authenticated administrator user to click a crafted malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code examples demonstrate using `sqlmap` to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The Joomla extension has been unpublished due to broken links. This might indicate that the vulnerability was not fixed and the extension was removed.
*   The advisory lists CVE-2016-1000117 alongside CVE-2016-1000118, suggesting that they may be related vulnerabilities in the same extension, specifically the XSS vulnerability is associated with CVE-2016-1000117. This document focuses on CVE-2016-1000118 which is associated with SQL injection.
