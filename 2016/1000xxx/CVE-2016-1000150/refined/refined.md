Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-1000150:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `ajaxURL` parameter within the `OOAAjax.js.php` file of the "simplified-content" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin directly echoes the unsanitized `$_REQUEST["ajaxURL"]` parameter into the JavaScript code, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the user's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive information (cookies, etc.)
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript within the `ajaxURL` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and trick a user into visiting it. This could be achieved through:
    - Sending the link to the victim via email or other messaging platform
    - Hosting the link on a malicious website.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable File: `./simplified-content/ooawpframework/js/ajax/OOAAjax.js.php`
- Vulnerable Code Snippet: `url: "<?php echo $_REQUEST["ajaxURL"]; ?>",`
- Example Exploit URL: `http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/simplified-content/ooawpframework/js/ajax/OOAAjax.js.php?ajaxURL="><script>alert(1);</script><"`

This exploit demonstrates a basic XSS attack by injecting JavaScript code that triggers an alert box, however, other more damaging scripts could be injected.
