{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-1000236",
    "description": "Node-cookie-signature before 1.0.6 is affected by a timing attack due to the type of comparison used.",
    "affected_component": "nodejs-cookie-signature library",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of a non-constant time comparison algorithm, which makes it susceptible to timing attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing Attack vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful timing attack could allow an attacker to recover the secret key used for signing cookies, leading to unauthorized access or session hijacking.",
     "attack_vector": "Network. An attacker can send requests that use different signature values and measure the time it takes for the server to respond. By observing the variations in response times, they can infer information about the secret key used for signing the cookies.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send requests and measure response times. It does not require any prior authentication on the system but some level of access to the service that uses the vulnerable library.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable versions use a comparison method that takes varying amounts of time depending on the position of the first differing character, which leads to a timing side channel. The fix replaces this comparison with a constant-time one where the time taken to perform a string comparison does not depend on the input."
