- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The code was not properly handling files with HTML-related MIME types, causing the browser to render them instead of downloading them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of HTML-related MIME types.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially upload malicious HTML files, which when viewed directly could execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions like session hijacking, stealing user data or injecting malicious content.
- **Attack vectors:** Uploading a file with an HTML-related MIME type to the repository.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the repository.
