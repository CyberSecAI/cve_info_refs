| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1391126#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-11-02 15:35:37 UTC  ``` Gnome GDM 3.14.2 and possibly later are vulnerable to an information disclosure vulnerability, specifically when a laptop screen is closed to trigger the screen lock, and the lid is then re-opened the previous contents of the screen are visible for approx. 1 second, which is long enough to take a picture or video record it before the lock screen kicks in.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1391126#c1)  Tim Jackson    2017-01-12 07:47:30 UTC  ``` Why WONTFIX?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1391126#c2)  Laurent Bigonville    2017-01-12 08:20:32 UTC  ``` Upstream bug: <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=753678>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1391126#c3)  Adam Mariš    2017-01-12 16:10:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tim Jackson from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1391126#c1)) > Why WONTFIX?  Requirement for physical access of the attacker and limited information disclosure as the only impact makes this a Low impact bug, hence WONTFIX.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1391126#c4)  Adam Mariš    2017-01-12 16:12:15 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
