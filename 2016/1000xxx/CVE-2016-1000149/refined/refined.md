Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `page` parameter from the GET request within the `simpel-reserveren/edit.php` file of the "simpel-reserveren" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin directly echoes the value of the `$_GET['page']` parameter into an HTML attribute without proper encoding or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through the `page` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the webpage
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `page` parameter and tricks the victim into clicking the link or loading the URL in their browser. The vulnerable URL format is:
    ```
    http://[target]/wp-content/plugins/simpel-reserveren/edit.php?page="><script>alert(1);</script><"
    ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `page` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user (victim) of the vulnerable WordPress site into loading the malicious crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability exists in version 3.5.2 of the "simpel-reserveren" plugin.
* The plugin is closed and no longer available for download
* The provided exploit code shows a basic example that injects a javascript alert, but any malicious javascript can be injected instead
