  "cve": "CVE-2016-8519",
  "affected_products": [
    "HPE Operations Orchestration Community edition",
    "HPE Operations Orchestration Enterprise edition"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `HttpInvokerServiceExport` in HP Operations Orchestration expects the payload of an HTTP POST request to be usable by an `ObjectInputStream`. It indirectly calls `readObject()` on the payload, leading to deserialization vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization"
    ],
     "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malicious crafted serialized object via HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint: `/oo/backwards-compatibility/wsExecutionBridgeService`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. If authentication is disabled, the vulnerability can be exploited by anyone. If enabled, authentication is required."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is exploitable due to the usage of `ObjectInputStream` in `HttpInvokerServiceExport` which results in insecure deserialization. The provided exploit proof of concept (POC) used ysoserial gadgets to achieve Remote Code Execution(RCE). This includes creating a file on the server, and executing commands like creating directories.",
