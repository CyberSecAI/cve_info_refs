{
  "vulnerability": {
    "id": "CVE-2016-8511",
    "details": "A Remote Code Execution vulnerability exists in HPE Network Automation using RPCServlet and Java Deserialization. The affected versions include v9.1x, v9.2x, v10.00, v10.00.01, v10.00.02, v10.10, v10.11, v10.11.01, and v10.20.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insecure handling of Java deserialization within the RPCServlet component of HPE Network Automation. This servlet allows the invocation of arbitrary static functions by the client, which can be abused via deserialization attacks using libraries like `Commons-Collections` and `Commons-BeanUtils` to execute `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Java deserialization",
      "Unrestricted access to arbitrary static function invocation via RPCServlet",
	  "Insufficient IP address filtering on RPCServlet",
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary remote code execution on the target system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted requests to the RPCServlet endpoint at `https://[target]/call`.",
	  "Phishing attack where a user opens a crafted webpage.",
      "Exploiting the vulnerable Java deserialization with libraries like Commons-Collections and Commons-BeanUtils."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET or POST requests to the vulnerable RPCServlet endpoint, or trick an internal user into accessing a malicious webpage. The attacker does not require authentication.",
    "additional_info": "By default, the `RPCServlet` is configured to only process requests from localhost. However, this can be circumvented using a crafted webpage if an internal user with the application on their machine opens the page, or via insecure deserialization methods. The vulnerability was discovered by Jacob Baines from Tenable Network Security. Patches have been released by HPE for versions 10.00.021, 10.11.011 and 10.20.001."
