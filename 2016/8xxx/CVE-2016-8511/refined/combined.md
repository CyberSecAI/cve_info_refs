### Synopsis

HP Network Automation (HP NA) software, available for Windows or Linux, "*automates the complete operational lifecycle of network devices from provisioning to policy-based change management, compliance, and security administration.*" Within HP NA, the `RPCServlet` or `com.rendition.web.servlets.RpcServlet.class` is an HTTP endpoint that can be invoked via GET or POST requests to the NA admin server at `https://[target]/call`. The sole purpose of the `RPCServlet` appears to be the invocation of arbitrary static functions by the client. This can be quite dangerous, but the servlet restricts access to specific IP addresses:

1. Two addresses are hardcoded into the servlet to always have access: 127.0.0.1 and 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 (aka localhost).
2. The “`gateway/mesh/host`” address in the configuration file is allowed access. By default, this value is not set.
3. All addresses in the “`rpc/allowed_ips`” configuration option. As far as we can tell this doesn’t even exist in the configuration by default.

So by default, the `RPCServlet` will only process requests from localhost. That prevents full-on remote code execution, but opens the door for phishing goodness. Similar to recent vulnerabilities found by Tavis Ormandy, if an attacker can get a user with HP NA installed on their machine to open a crafted webpage then the attacker can access RPCServlet and execute arbitrary commands. This vector is also exploitable via deserialization attacks. Two specific libraries are useful here: `Commons-Collections` and `Commons-BeanUtils`. We can leverage these libraries to create serialized objects to eventually execute `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`.

### Solution

HPE has released Hewlett Packard Network Automation versions 10.00.021, 10.11.011, and 10.20.001 to address this issue.
