{
  "CVE-2016-8666": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remotely triggerable unbounded recursion in GRE code was found. If a packet has the layout: IPv4 header | GRE header | IPv4 header | GRE header | ... depending on left over stack, it could run the kernel out of stack due to recursion and so crash the kernel.",
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's networking subsystem had a flaw in how it handled offloaded packets with multiple layers of encapsulation in the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) code path.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Unbounded recursion due to multiple layers of encapsulation not being checked in the GRO code path."
      ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger a kernel crash by sending maliciously crafted packets.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends packets with multiple layers of encapsulation through GRE tunnels.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to a vulnerable system."
    ,
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by an unlimited recursion in both VLAN and TEB modules. This is caused by missing checks for multiple encapsulation layers in the GRO code path, which can be abused to cause a stack overflow in the kernel. The issue is resolved by limiting GRO to only one layer of encapsulation. "
