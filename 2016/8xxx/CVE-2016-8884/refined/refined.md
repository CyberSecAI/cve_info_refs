  "CVE-2016-8884": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "CVE",
      "CNA": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by missing checks on the `numrows` and `numcols` parameters in the `jas_matrix_create()` function. This allows for the creation of a matrix in an inconsistent state (where data_ is NULL but datasize_ is non-zero) when negative values are provided for these parameters. The vulnerable code is located in `src/libjasper/bmp/bmp_dec.c`.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Null pointer dereference vulnerability: The incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8690 allowed for a null pointer dereference in the bmp_getdata function because of inconsistent state of the created matrix."
      ],
      "Impact": "A specially crafted BMP image can trigger a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash of the application using the jasper library.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is by processing a crafted BMP image with applications utilizing the jasper library.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted BMP file to an application using the jasper library."
      
    }
