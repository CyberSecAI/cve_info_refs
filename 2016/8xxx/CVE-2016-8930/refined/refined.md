- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the IBM Kenexa LMS on Cloud application. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability is present.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can send specially crafted SQL statements that could allow the attacker to view, add, modify, or delete information in the back-end database. This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and potential compromise of the system and sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, where the attacker sends malicious SQL statements through the application's interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user and have the ability to send specially crafted SQL statements to the vulnerable application.
