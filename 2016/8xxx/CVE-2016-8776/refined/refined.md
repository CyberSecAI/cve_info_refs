- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper implementation of Factory Reset Protection (FRP) in Huawei smartphones. During the re-configuration process after a factory reset, an attacker can bypass the FRP by accessing certain functional modules without proper authorization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  -  FRP bypass: The vulnerability allows bypassing the Factory Reset Protection mechanism, intended to prevent unauthorized access after a device is reset.
  - Unauthorized access to functional modules: An attacker can access certain functional modules without proper authorization.
  - Modification of Google Account: An attacker can modify and update the google account using these functional modules.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify the configuration of the smartphone and cause the FRP bypass, effectively gaining unauthorized access to the device.
- **Attack vectors:**
   - The attacker needs physical access to the smartphone.
   - The attack is carried out during the device re-configuration after a factory reset.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - Physical access to the vulnerable smartphone.
   - Ability to perform a factory reset of the device.
   - Basic understanding of Android configuration process
