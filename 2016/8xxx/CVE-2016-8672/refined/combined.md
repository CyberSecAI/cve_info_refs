SUMMARY

SIMATIC CP 343-1 Advanced/CP-443-1 Advanced devices and SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs are
affected by two vulnerabilities. One of the vulnerabilities could allow remote attackers to perform
operations as an authenticated user under certain conditions.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 343-1 and CP 443-1 are communication processors (CP) designed to enable Ethernet
communication for SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs.

SIMATIC S7-300 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environ-
ments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-400 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environ-
ments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2016-8672

The integrated web server delivers cookies without the “secure” ﬂag. Modern browsers interpreting
the ﬂag would mitigate potential data leakage in case of clear text transmission.

Attribute

Vulnerability CVE-2016-8673

The integrated web server at port 80/TCP or port 443/TCP of the affected devices could allow remote
attackers to perform actions with the permissions of an authenticated user, provided the targeted user
has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request.
