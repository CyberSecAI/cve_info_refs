The provided content is related to CVE-2016-8720.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of the `bkpath` parameter in HTTP requests within the Moxa AWK-3131A web application. Specifically, the value of the `bkpath` parameter is directly copied into the Location header of the HTTP response without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- HTTP Header Injection. The `bkpath` parameter is not validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the `Location` header.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious content into the `Location` header. This can lead to several attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), cache poisoning, or redirecting users to malicious websites. The provided exploit shows how a crafted `bkpath` parameter will cause the web application to redirect the user to an attacker-controlled URL.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests. An attacker can send a specially crafted POST request to the `/forms/iw_webSetParameters` endpoint, including the malicious payload in the `bkpath` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application of the Moxa AWK-3131A device. No authentication is needed. The user needs to access the redirected URL.
