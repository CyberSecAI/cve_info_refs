- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A null pointer dereference occurs due to an HTTP POST request with a blank line in the header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The web server does not handle blank lines in the HTTP header properly leading to a null pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The web server crashes due to a segmentation fault. The web application cannot be restarted without rebooting the device, leading to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a blank line in the header to the `/forms/web_runScript` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
