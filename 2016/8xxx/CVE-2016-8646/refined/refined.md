{
  "CVE-2016-8646": {
    "Description": "An unprivileged local user could trigger an oops in shash_async_export() by attempting to force in-kernel hashing algorithms into decrypting an empty data set. Not all in-kernel algorithms are affected.",
    "Root cause": "The `hash_accept` call fails on sockets that haven't received any data. For some hashing algorithms, this can cause crashes when attempting to export/import on such sockets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the fact that the Linux kernel's hashing algorithm implementation does not properly handle the case of an empty data set being passed for decryption, leading to an attempt to perform crypto operations on data that doesn't exist.",
	  "The code tries to export and import hash state on sockets that have not received data, which may lead to crashes in some algorithms."
    ],
    "Impact": "An unprivileged local user can trigger a kernel oops, which may lead to a denial-of-service condition. Privilege escalation cannot be ruled out entirely but is not considered to be the primary attack vector.",
    "Attack vector": "Local exploitation through crafted system calls that leverage in-kernel hashing algorithms.",
    "Required capabilities": "Unprivileged local user access is sufficient to trigger this vulnerability."
