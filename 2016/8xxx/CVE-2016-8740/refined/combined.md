#### Description

The mod\_http2 module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 through 2.4.23, when the Protocols configuration includes h2 or h2c, does not restrict request-header length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via crafted CONTINUATION frames in an HTTP/2 request.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1414)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1401528#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-05 14:06:56 UTC  ``` The HTTP/2 protocol implementation (mod_http2) had an incomplete handling of the LimitRequestFields directive. This allowed an attacker to inject unlimited request headers into the server, leading to eventual memory exhaustion.  Affects all versions from  2.4.17 to  2.4.23.  Mitigation:  As a temporary workaround - HTTP/2 can be disabled by changing the configuration by removing h2 and h2c from the Protocols line(s) in the configuration file.   The resulting line should read:  		Protocols http/1.1  External References:  <https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html> <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2016/Dec/3>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1401528#c2)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-05 14:10:43 UTC  ```  Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1401530](show_bug.cgi?id=1401530 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-8740 httpd: Incomplete handling of LimitRequestFields directive in mod_http2 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1401528#c3)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-05 14:13:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1228070](attachment.cgi?id=1228070&action=diff "httpd 2.4.23 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1228070&action=edit "httpd 2.4.23 patch") httpd 2.4.23 patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1401528#c4)  Doran Moppert    2016-12-16 04:16:01 UTC  ``` This doesn't affect default configurations, the impact is limited to a crash and there is amplification - ie, the attacker needs to send O(total available memory) bytes to cause a crash.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1401528#c5)  Doran Moppert    2016-12-16 04:17:57 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact.

RHSA-2017:1415 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2017:1415 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

# [R5] SecurityCenter 5.4.3 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

SecurityCenter has recently been discovered to contain several vulnerabilities. Four issues in the SC code were discovered during internal testing by Barry Clark, and several third-party libraries were upgraded as part of our internal security process. Note that the library vulnerabilities were not fully diagnosed so SecurityCenter is possibly impacted. Tenable opted to upgrade the libraries as it was more efficient than diagnosing each issue. Details of the issues are below, with VDB IDs and/or internal IDs for your tracking pleasure. Note that not all library vulnerabilities have a CVE assignment:

* PHP ext/phar/phar.c phar\_parse\_pharfile() Function Phar Archive Handling Out-of-bounds Read DoS
* PHP ext/exif/exif.c exif\_convert\_any\_to\_int() Function TIFF / JPEG Image Tag Handling Floating Pointer Exception Remote DoS (CVE-2016-10158)
* PHP ext/standard/var\_unserializer.c finish\_nested\_data() Function Unserialized Data Handling Out-of-bounds Read Remote Weakness (CVE-2016-10161)
* PHP ext/phar/phar.c phar\_parse\_pharfile() Function Phar Archive Handling Off-by-one Remote Buffer Overflow DoS (CVE-2016-10160)
* PHP ext/phar/phar.c phar\_parse\_pharfile() Function Phar Archive Handling Integer Overflow DoS (CVE-2016-10159)
* GD Graphics Library (LibGD) gd\_gd2.c gdImageCreateFromGd2Ctx() Function Insufficient Image Data Handling DoS (CVE-2016-10167)
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/asm/x86\_64-mont5.pl Montgomery Squaring Procedure BN\_mod\_exp Incorrect Results Private Key Derivation Weakness (CVE-2017-3732)
* OpenSSL crypto/evp/e\_chacha20\_poly1305.c CHACHA20-POLY1305 Cipher Packet Handling Out-of-bounds Read Remote DoS (CVE-2017-3731)
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/asm/x86\_64-mont.pl Montgomery Multiplication Incorrect Results Weakness (CVE-2016-7055)
* Apache HTTP Server User-Agent Whitespace Pattern Handling Cache Pollution Response Confusion Cross-session Information Disclosure (CVE-2016-8743)
* Apache HTTP Server modules/aaa/mod\_auth\_digest.c Client Entry Allocation Shared Memory Space Exhaustion Remote DoS (CVE-2016-2161)
* Apache HTTP Server Session Data / Cookie Padding Oracle Attack Information Disclosure Weakness (CVE-2016-0736)
* Apache HTTP Server mod\_http2 HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Frame Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS (CVE-2016-8740)
* Apache HTTP Server Proxy Header Injection HTTP\_PROXY Environment Variable Overwrite Remote Proxy Manipulation (CVE-2016-5387 / CVE-2016-1000104 / CVE-2016-1000102)
* libcurl lib/rand.c randit() Function Uninitialized Random Value Weak Cryptographic Operations (CVE-2016-9594)
* Authenticated Stored XSS (Internal ID 31620)
* Authenticated Stored XSS (Internal ID 31619)
* Authenticated Stored XSS (Internal ID 31498)
* Authenticated Stored XSS (Internal ID 31430)

* [CVEs](#cve)

## A CGI application vulnerability (in 2016) for PHP, Go, Python and others

*httpoxy* is a set of vulnerabilities that affect application code running in CGI, or CGI-like environments. It comes
down to a simple namespace conflict:

* RFC 3875 (CGI) puts the HTTP `Proxy` header from a request into the environment variables as `HTTP_PROXY`
* `HTTP_PROXY` is a popular environment variable used to configure an outgoing proxy

This leads to a remotely exploitable vulnerability. If youâre running PHP or CGI, you should block the `Proxy` header.
[Hereâs how.](#fix-now)

httpoxy is a vulnerability for server-side web applications. If youâre not deploying code, you donât need to worry.

#### What can happen if my web application is vulnerable?

If a vulnerable HTTP client makes an outgoing HTTP connection, while running in a server-side CGI application, an
attacker may be able to:

* Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application
* Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing
* Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy

httpoxy is extremely easy to exploit in basic form. And we expect security
researchers to be able to scan for it quickly. Luckily, if you read on and
find you are affected, [easy mitigations](#fix-now) are available.

## Isnât this old news? Is this still a problem?

httpoxy **was disclosed in mid-2016**. If youâre reading about it now for the first time, you can *probably* relax and
take your time reading about this quaint historical bug that *hopefully* no longer affects any of the applications you
maintain. But you should verify that to your own satisfaction.

The content below this point reflects the original disclosure, and Iâll be leaving the site up and mostly unchanged, other
than noting fix versions where I can. I guess Iâm just saying: the time for urgency was last year.

## What Is Affected

A few things are necessary to be vulnerable:

* Code running under a CGI-like context, where `HTTP_PROXY` becomes a real or emulated environment variable
* An HTTP client that trusts `HTTP_PROXY`, and configures it as the proxy
* That client, used within a request handler, making an HTTP (as opposed to HTTPS) request

For example, the confirmed cases weâve found so far:

| Language | Environment | HTTP client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHP | php-fpm  mod\_php | Guzzle 4+  Artax |
| Python | wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler  twisted.web.twcgi.CGIScript | requests |
| Go | net/http/cgi | net/http |

But obviously there may be languages we havenât considered yet. CGI is a common standard, and
`HTTP_PROXY` seems to be becoming more popular over time. Take the below as a sample of the most
commonly affected scenarios:

### PHP

* Whether you are vulnerable depends on your specific application code and PHP libraries, but the problem
  seems fairly widespread
* Just *using* one of the vulnerable libraries, while processing a userâs request, is exploitable.
* If youâre using a vulnerable library, this vulnerability will affect any version of PHP
  + It even affects alternative PHP runtimes such as HHVM deployed under FastCGI
* It is present in Guzzle, Artax, and probably many, many libraries
  + Guzzle versions in the range `>=4.0.0rc2,<6.2.1` are vulnerable, Guzzle 3 and below is not.
  + Another example is (update: was) in Composerâs StreamContextBuilder utility class

So, for example, if you are using a Drupal module that uses Guzzle `6.2.0` and makes an outgoing HTTP request (for example,
to check a weather API), you are vulnerable to the request that plugin makes being âhttpoxiedâ.

### Python

* Python code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, thatâll mean the vulnerable code
  will use a CGI handler like `wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler`
  + This is not considered a normal way of deploying Python webapps (most people are using WSGI or FastCGI, both of which are
    not affected), so vulnerable Python applications will probably be much rarer than vulnerable PHP applications.
  + wsgi, for example, is not vulnerable, because os.environ is not polluted by CGI data
* Vulnerable versions of the requests library will trust and use `os.environ['HTTP_PROXY']`, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in `2.7.13`, `3.4.6`, `3.5.3`, `3.6.0` (see [the Python advisory](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/cve-2016-1000110_httpoxy_attack.html))

### Go

* Go code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, thatâll mean the vulnerable code uses
  the `net/http/cgi` package.
  + As with Python, this is not considered a usual way of deploying Go as a web application, so this vulnerability should be
    relatively rare
  + Goâs `net/http/fcgi` package, by comparison, does not set actual environment variables, so it is *not* vulnerable
* Vulnerable versions of `net/http` will trust and use `HTTP_PROXY` for outgoing requests, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in Go `1.7rc3`, all stable versions of `>=1.7`

## Immediate Mitigation

The best immediate mitigation is to block `Proxy` request headers as early as possible, and before they hit your
application. This is easy and safe.

* Itâs safe because the `Proxy` header is undefined by the IETF, and isnât listed on the
  [IANAâs registry of message headers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml). This means
  **there is no standard use for the header at all**; not even a provisional use-case.
* Standards-compliant HTTP clients and servers will never read or send this header.
* You can either strip the header or completely block requests attempting to use it.
* You should try to do your mitigation as *early* and as far *upstream* as you can.
  + Do it âat the edgeâ, where HTTP requests first enter your system.
  + That way, you can fix lots of vulnerable software at once.
  + Everything behind a reverse proxy or application firewall that strips the `Proxy` header is safe!

How you block a `Proxy` header depends on the specifics of your setup. The earliest convenient place to block the header
might be at a web application firewall device, or directly on the webserver running Apache or NGINX. Here are a few of
the more common mitigations:

### NGINX/FastCGI

Use this to block the header from being passed on to PHP-FPM, PHP-PM etc.

```
fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";

```

In FastCGI configurations, PHP is vulnerable (but many other languages that use NGINX FastCGI are not).

For specific NGINX coverage, we recommend that you read the official [NGINX blog post](https://www.nginx.com/blog/mitigating-the-httpoxy-vulnerability-with-nginx)
on this vulnerability. The blog post provides a graphic depiction of how
httpoxy works and more extensive mitigation information for NGINX.

### Apache

For specific Apache coverage (and details for other Apache software projects like Tomcat), we strongly recommend
you read the [Apache Software Foundationâs official advisory](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt) on
the matter. The very basic mitigation information youâll find below is covered in much greater depth there.

If youâre using Apache HTTP Server with `mod_cgi`, languages like Go and Python may be vulnerable (the `HTTP_PROXY` env var
is ârealâ). And `mod_php` is affected due to the nature of PHP. If you are using **mod\_headers**, you can unset the
`Proxy` header before further processing with this directive:

```
RequestHeader unset Proxy early

```

Example for using this in `.htaccess` files:

```
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
   RequestHeader unset Proxy
</IfModule>

```

If you are using **mod\_security**, you can use a `SecRule` to deny traffic with a `Proxy` header. Hereâs an example,
vary the action to taste, and make sure `SecRuleEngine` is on. The 1000005 ID has been assigned to this issue.

```
SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Proxy "@gt 0" "id:1000005,log,deny,msg:'httpoxy denied'"

```

Finally, if youâre using Apache Traffic Server, itâs not itself affected, but you can use it to strip the `Proxy` header; very helpful
for any services sitting behind it. Again, see the [ASFâs guidance](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt),
but one possible configuration is:

* Within `plugin.config`, inside the configuration directory (e.g. `/usr/local/etc/trafficserver` or `/etc/trafficserver`),
  add the following directive:

  ```
  header_rewrite.so strip_proxy.conf

  ```
* Add the following to a new file named `strip_proxy.conf` in the same directory:

  ```
  cond %{READ_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK}
  rm-header Proxy

  ```

### HAProxy

This will strip the header off requests:

```
http-request del-header Proxy

```

If your version of HAProxy is old (i.e. `1.4` or earlier), you may not have the `http-request del-header` directive.
If so, you must also take care that headers are stripped from requests served after the first one over an HTTP 1.1
keep-alive connection. (i.e. take special note of the limitation described in the first paragraph of [the 1.4 âheader
manipulationâ documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.4/configuration.html#6))

### Varnish

For Varnish, the following should unset the header. Add it to the pre-existing vcl\_recv section:

```
sub vcl_recv {
    [...]
    unset req.http.proxy;
    [...]
}

```
### OpenBSD relayd

For relayd, the following should remove the header. Add it to a pre-existing filter:

```
http protocol httpfilter {
        match request header remove "Proxy"
}

```
### lighttpd

#### <= 1.4.40

To reject requests containing a `Proxy` header

* Create `/path/to/deny-proxy.lua`, read-only to lighttpd, with the content:

  ```
  if (lighty.request["Proxy"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end

  ```
* Modify `lighttpd.conf` to load `mod_magnet` and run the above lua code:

  ```
  server.modules += ( "mod_magnet" )
  magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua" )

  ```

#### lighttpd2 (development)

To strip the `Proxy` header from the request, add the following to `lighttpd.conf`:

```
req_header.remove "Proxy";

```
### Microsoft IIS with PHP or a CGI framework

For detailed information about mitigating httpoxy on IIS, you should
head to the official [Microsoft article KB3179800](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3179800), which covers
the below mitigations in greater detail.

Also important to know: httpoxy does not affect any Microsoft Web Frameworks, e.g. not ASP.NET nor Active Server Pages.
But if you have installed PHP or any other third party framework on top of IIS, we recommend applying mitigation steps
to protect from httpoxy attacks. You can either block requests containing a `Proxy` header, or clear the header. (The header
is safe to block, because browsers will not generally send it at all).

To *block* requests that contain a `Proxy` header (the preferred solution), run the following command line.

```
appcmd set config /section:requestfiltering /+requestlimits.headerLimits.[header='proxy',sizelimit='0']

```

**Note:** `appcmd.exe` is not typically in the path and can be found in the `%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv` directory

To *clear* the value of the header, use the following URL Rewrite rule:

```
<system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
        <rules>
            <rule name="Erase HTTP_PROXY" patternSyntax="Wildcard">
                <match url="*.*" />
                <serverVariables>
                    <set name="HTTP_PROXY" value="" />
                </serverVariables>
                <action type="None" />
            </rule>
        </rules>
    </rewrite>
</system.webServer>

```

**Note:** URL Rewrite is a downloadable add-in for IIS and is not included in a default IIS installation.

### Hiawatha

You can block any request containing a `Proxy` header (or ban the sending client) via the UrlToolkit:

```
UrlToolkit {
  ToolkitID = block_httpoxy
  Header Proxy .* DenyAccess
}

```

See more information at the [hiawatha blog](https://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/weblog/115)

### LiteSpeed Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 5.0.19` or `>= 5.1.7` to mitigate. You can do this manually with one of these commands, or youâll get
an upgrade notification soon.

```
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.0.19 # or
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.1.7

```

See more information at the [litespeed blog](http://blog.litespeedtech.com/2016/07/18/the-httpoxy-vulnerability-has-been-taken-care-of-by-litespeed-automatically/)

### h2o Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 2.0.2` and add this to your configuration:

```
setenv:
  HTTP_PROXY: ""

```

More information can be found in this [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/996).

### Other CGI software and applications

Please let us know of other places where httpoxy is found. Weâd be happy to help you communicate fixes for your platform,
server or library if you are affected. Contact contact@httpoxy.org to let us
know. Or create a PR or issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org) in GitHub.

## Ineffective fixes in PHP

Userland PHP fixes donât work. Donât bother:

* Using `unset($_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY'])` does not affect the value returned from `getenv()`, so is not an effective
  mitigation
* Using `putenv('HTTP_PROXY=')` does not work either (to be precise: it only works if that value is coming from an
  actual environment variable rather than a header â so, it cannot be used for mitigation)

## Prevention

### Summary

* If you can avoid it, do not deploy into environments where the CGI data is merged into the actual environment variables
* Use and expect `CGI_HTTP_PROXY` to set the proxy for a CGI applicationâs internal requests, if necessary
  + You can still support `HTTP_PROXY`, but you must assert that CGI is not in use
  + In PHP, check `PHP_SAPI == 'cli'`
  + Otherwise, a simple check is to not trust `HTTP_PROXY` if `REQUEST_METHOD` is also set. RFC 3875 seems to require
    this meta-variable:

    > The `REQUEST_METHOD` meta-variable MUST be set to the method which should be used by the script to process the request

### Donât Trust `HTTP_PROXY` Under CGI

To put it plainly: there is no way to trust the value of an `HTTP_` env var in a CGI environment. They cannot be
distinguished from request headers according to the specification. So, *any* usage of `HTTP_PROXY` in a CGI context is
suspicious.

If you need to configure the proxy of a CGI application via an environment variable, use a variable name that will
never conflict with request headers. That is: one that does not begin with `HTTP_`. We strongly recommend you go for
`CGI_HTTP_PROXY`. (As seen in Ruby and libwww-perlâs mitigations for this issue.)

### PHP

CLI-only code may safely trust `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` or `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`. But bear in mind that code written
for the CLI context often ends up running in a SAPI eventually, particularly utility or library code. And, with open
source code, that might not even be your doing. So, if you are going to rely on `HTTP_PROXY` at all, you should guard
that code with a check of the `PHP_SAPI` constant.

### Network Configuration as Prevention

A defense-in-depth strategy that can combat httpoxy (and entire classes of other security problems) is to severely restrict
the outgoing requests your web application can make to an absolute minimum. For example, if a web application is
firewalled in such a way that it *cannot* make outgoing HTTP requests, an attacker will not be able to receive
the âmisproxiedâ requests (because the web application is prevented from connecting to the attacker).

### HTTPS

And, of course, another defense-in-depth strategy that works is to use HTTPS for internal requests, not just for
securing your siteâs connections to the outside world. HTTPS requests arenât affected by `HTTP_PROXY`.

## How It Works

Using PHP as an example, because it is illustrative. PHP has a method called `getenv()`[1](#fn:php-getenv).

There is a common vulnerability in many PHP libraries and applications, introduced by confusing
`getenv` for a method that only returns environment variables. In fact, getenv() is closer to the
`$_SERVER` superglobal: it contains both environment variables and user-controlled data.

Specifically, when PHP is running under a CGI-like server, the HTTP request headers (data supplied
by the client) are merged into the `$_SERVER` superglobal under keys beginning with `HTTP_`. This is
the same information that `getenv` reads from.

When a user sends a request with a `Proxy` header, the header appears to the PHP application as `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`.
Some common PHP libraries have been trusting this value, even when run in a CGI/SAPI environment.

Reading and trusting `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` is exactly the same vulnerability, but tends to happen much less often
(perhaps because of getenvâs name, perhaps because the semantics of the `$_SERVER` superglobal are better understood among
the community).

### Minimal example code

Note that these examples require deployment into a vulnerable environment before there is actually a vulnerability
(e.g. php-fpm, or Apacheâs `ScriptAlias`)

#### PHP

```
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$client->get('http://api.internal/?secret=foo')

```
#### Python

```
from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
def application(environ, start_response):
    requests.get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
CGIHandler().run(application)

```
#### Go

```
cgi.Serve(
    http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        res, _ := http.Get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
        // [...]

```

More complete PoC repos (using Docker, and testing with an actual listener for the proxied request) have been prepared
under the [httpoxy Github organization](https://github.com/httpoxy).

## Why It Happened

Under the CGI spec, headers are provided mixed into the environment variables. (These are formally known as
âProtocol-Specific Meta-Variablesâ[2](#fn:meta-variables)). Thatâs just the way the spec works, not a failure or bug.

The goal of the code, in most of the vulnerabilities, is to find the correct proxy to use, when auto-configuring a
client for the internal HTTP request made shortly after. This task in Ruby could be completed by
the `find_proxy` method of `URI::Generic`, which notes:

> `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY` are treated specially under the CGI environment, because `HTTP_PROXY` may be set by Proxy:
> header. So `HTTP_PROXY` is not used. `http_proxy` is not used too if the variable is case insensitive. `CGI_HTTP_PROXY`
> can be used instead.
>
> From the [Ruby stdlib documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI/Generic.html#method-i-find_proxy)

Other instances of the same vulnerability are present in other languages. For example, when
using Goâs `net/http/cgi` module, and deploying as a CGI application. This indicates the vulnerability
is a standard danger in CGI environments.

## History of httpoxy

This bug was first discovered over 15 years ago. The timeline goes something like:

March 2001

The issue is discovered in libwww-perl and fixed. Reported by Randal L. Schwartz. [3](#fn:perl-bug)

April 2001

The issue is discovered in curl, and fixed there too (albeit probably not for Windows). Reported by Cris Bailiff. [4](#fn:curl-bug)

July 2012

In implementing `HTTP_PROXY` for `Net::HTTP`, the Ruby team notice and avoid the potential issue. Nice work Akira Tanaka! [5](#fn:ruby-ref)

November 2013

The issue is mentioned on the NGINX mailing list. The user humbly points out the issue: âunless
Iâm missing something, which is very possibleâ. No, Jonathan Matthews, you were exactly right! [6](#fn:nginx-ref)

February 2015

The issue is mentioned on the Apache httpd-dev mailing list. Spotted by Stefan Fritsch. [7](#fn:apache-ref)

July 2016

Scott Geary, an engineer at Vend, found an instance of the bug in the wild. The Vend security team found the vulnerability
was still exploitable in PHP, and present in many modern languages and libraries. We started to disclose to security response teams.

So, the bug was lying dormant for years, like a latent infection: pox. We imagine that many people may have found the issue over
the years, but never investigated its scope in other languages and libraries. If youâve found a historical discussion
of interest that weâve missed, let us know. You can contact contact@httpoxy.org
or create an issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org).

## CVEs

httpoxy has a number of CVEs assigned. These cover the cases where

* a language or CGI implementation makes the `Proxy` header available in such a way that the application cannot tell whether
  it is a real environment variable, or
* an application trusts the value of the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable by default in a CGI environment (but only where that application should have been
  able to tell it came from a request)

The assigned CVEs so far:

* CVE-2016-5385: PHP
* CVE-2016-5386: Go
* CVE-2016-5387: Apache HTTP Server
* CVE-2016-5388: Apache Tomcat
* CVE-2016-6286: spiffy-cgi-handlers for CHICKEN
* CVE-2016-6287: CHICKENâs http-client
* CVE-2016-1000104: mod\_fcgi
* CVE-2016-1000105: Nginx cgi script
* CVE-2016-1000107: Erlang inets
* CVE-2016-1000108: YAWS
* CVE-2016-1000109: HHVM FastCGI
* CVE-2016-1000110: Python CGIHandler
* CVE-2016-1000111: Python Twisted
* CVE-2016-1000212: lighttpd

We suspect there may be more CVEs coming for httpoxy, as less common software is checked over. If you
want to get a CVE assigned for an httpoxy issue, there are a couple of options:

* For open source code projects, you can use the [Distributed Weakness Filing Project](https://distributedweaknessfiling.org/) (DWF).
  They have a simple way to report (public) issues using the form at [iwantacve.org](https://iwantacve.org/)
* For closed source code projects, you can talk to [MITRE, or one of their participating CNAs/vendors/coordinators](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html).

Over the past two weeks, the Vend security team worked to disclose the issue responsibly to as many affected parties as we
could. Weâd like to thank the members of:

* The Red Hat Product Security team, who provided extremely useful advice and access to their experience disclosing
  widespread vulnerabilities - if youâre sitting on a big or complicated disclosure, theyâre a great resource to reach
  out to for help.
* The language and implementation teams, who kept to disclosure norms and provided lively discussion.

## Description

The mod\_http2 module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 through 2.4.23, when the Protocols configuration includes h2 or h2c, does not restrict request-header length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via crafted CONTINUATION frames in an HTTP/2 request.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

#### Description

Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution.

#### Description

The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue. NOTE: the vendor states "This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1161)

## Topic

Updated httpd24 packages are now available as a part of Red Hat Software Collections 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server. The httpd24 packages provide a recent stable release of version 2.4 of the Apache HTTP Server, along with the mod\_auth\_kerb module.

The httpd24 Software Collection has been upgraded to version 2.4.25, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. For detailed changes, see the Red Hat Software Collections 2.4 Release Notes linked from the References section. (BZ#1404778)

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* A denial of service flaw was found in httpd's mod\_http2 module. A remote attacker could use this flaw to block server threads for long times, causing starvation of worker threads, by manipulating the flow control windows on streams. (CVE-2016-1546)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)

Note: The fix for the CVE-2016-8743 issue causes httpd to return "400 Bad Request" error to HTTP clients which do not strictly follow HTTP protocol specification. A newly introduced configuration directive "HttpProtocolOptions Unsafe" can be used to re-enable the old less strict parsing. However, such setting also re-introduces the CVE-2016-8743 issue.

* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

#### Description

There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.
