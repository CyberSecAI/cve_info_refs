Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8636:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2016-8636. The commit message `IB/rxe: Fix mem_check_range integer overflow` explicitly mentions that it `Resolves CVE 2016-8636`. The blog post also directly references the CVE ID and provides details on the vulnerability.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

-   The vulnerability is caused by an **integer overflow** in the `mem_check_range` function within the Linux kernel's RDMA over Infiniband (rxe) software implementation.
-   The original code performs a check like `(iova < mem->iova) || ((iova + length) > (mem->iova + mem->length))`. This check is intended to verify if a memory access falls within a valid memory region.
-   However, the `length` variable is not checked for validity before the addition operation. A large `length` value, when added to `iova`, can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a small or negative value, which incorrectly passes the bounds check.
-   The code assumed that `iova <= iova + length` would always be true, but this is false when the addition wraps around.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is the unchecked addition of `iova` and `length`, which can wrap around due to integer limits.
-   **Insufficient Bounds Check:** The original bounds check logic was flawed, assuming that `iova <= iova + length` and failing to independently validate `length` and the overall computed memory range.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Memory Corruption (Write):** An attacker could send a crafted read/write request with a large length, bypassing the faulty bounds check, which allows for writing data to arbitrary memory locations.
-   **Memory Leakage (Read):**  Similarly, arbitrary memory locations could be read by crafting the request.
-   **Undefined Behavior:** The vulnerability could lead to a wide range of issues depending on the memory locations that are accessed, including kernel crashes and potentially privilege escalation.

**5. Attack vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through crafted read/write requests to the RDMA over Infiniband software implementation (Soft RoCE).

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   An attacker needs to have the ability to send RDMA read/write requests over Infiniband, thus they would need to be on a machine that has a connection to the affected system via Infiniband.
-   The attacker does not necessarily need root/admin access on the local machine to exploit this vulnerability, but needs the ability to send these specific requests.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is located in `drivers/infiniband/sw/rxe/rxe_mr.c`.
-   The fix involved breaking down the original compound condition to three separate checks:
    -   Check if `iova` is less than the start of the memory region.
    -   Check if `length` is greater than the allocated memory region's length.
    -   Check if `iova` is beyond the valid region end `(mem->iova + mem->length - length)`.
-   The bugzilla entry indicates that Red Hat Enterprise Linux was not directly affected, since it did not ship with the vulnerable software implementation.
-   The blog post includes the vulnerable code and the fix from the commit.
-   The kernel commit log confirms this fix.
-   The openwall post is the original publication request for this CVE.
