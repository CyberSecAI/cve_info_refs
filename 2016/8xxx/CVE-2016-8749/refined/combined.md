Subject: Code Execution through a variety Java (Un-)Marshallers

Hi,

(As per list policy I tried to include the most relevant information,
but I don't think including the full details makes any sense - hope that
is okay.)

Full paper as well as payload generation tools are available at
<<https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/>>

Over the past two years we have seen a great number of vulnerabilities
resulting from careless use of Java serialization.

This research shows that issues like that are in no way limited to
mechanisms as expressive or "powerful" as Java serialization but can be
generalized to a wide range of other ones.

Any unmarshaller that performs object binding, implicitly (e.g. magic
methods on collection insertion) or explicitly (e.g. property setters)
executes behaviors attached to the object's type (read: calls
methods/executes codes).

To do their work these mechanisms need to assume some kind of contract
on these behaviors - simply put, they should not have any side effects.
In practice however these conventions are broken quite often, either
deliberately or unconsciously, and can lead to the execution of code
with unwanted side-effects, in the worst case trigger command or remote
code execution.

Many mechanisms embed type information in their outputs. In some form
this is always required to properly restore polymorphic types (and pre
Java 1.5 this was even required for regular collections as well).
Insufficiently restricting the types that can be used there however
means that an attacker can trigger these behaviors on more or less
arbitrary types on the classpath (which in a normal Java projects is a
humongous amount of code no-one fully understands - standard library
alone...).

That usually is enough to achieve RCE, in some cases using some third
party library code, in many cases even universally through code in the
Java standard library.

Even the most restrictive implicit (technical) type restrictions (e.g.
constructor requirements) that can be applied by these mechanisms are
insufficient to prevent these issues. With Java's java.io.Serializable
we have already seen a model fail where the types themselves declare
their intent to be used in such a situation (for various reasons),
although not having such a restriction seems even worse.

The only option left is explicit restriction to types known to fulfill
the contract by the user, be that in the form of registration (e.g. JAXB
or a variety of mechanisms requiring schema definitions or compilation),
an explicit whitelist or strict runtime type checking from a root type.
Hybrid type checking and registration like found in GSON or Jackson with
JsonTypeInfo.Id.Name so far seem to offer the best balance between
convenience and security.

While in the best case scenario one would restrict to data objects not
containing any logic at all -- for practical purposes restricting to the
types that are actually used seems good enough, usually it's the ton of
code that you don't even care about that will get you pwned.

(Open Source) marshaller libraries (some pretty rare, but for the sake
of completeness) that allow(ed) for unmarshalling into arbitrary types,
their their known worst case impacts and possible mitigations, are

-------------------------------
Apache BlazeDS AMF Marshalling
- JDK only escalation to Java serialization
- third party library RCEs (spring, c3p0)

Mitigations: Configure a DeserializationValidator for type whitelisting.
Upgrade to 4.7.3 which enables it by default (CVE-2017-5641).

-------------------------------
Hessian/Burlap:
- third party library RCEs (spring, rome, xbean-naming, resin)

Mitigation: Upgrade to 4.0.51 and enable type whitelisting through
ClassFactory.

-------------------------------
Castor:
-> POM dependency library RCE (spring)

Mitigation: N/A

-------------------------------
Jackson:
- >=2.7.0: not totally reliable JDK only RCE
- possibly JDK only escalation to Java serialization
- third party library RCEs (spring, c3p0)

Jackson takes a somewhat special position here, in that by default it is
unaffected but only becomes exploitable when class based polymorphism is
enabled
(<https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/JacksonPolymorphicDeserialization>)
and there are unbounded or insufficiently bounded properties.

Mitigation: Use explicit polymorphism with JsonTypeInfo.Id.Name

-------------------------------
Java serialization:
- one new library gadget

-------------------------------
Java XMLDecoder:
- well, we know about that one...

-------------------------------
json-io
-> JDK only RCE

Mitigation: N/A

-------------------------------
jYAML
-> JDK only RCE

Mitigation: N/A

-------------------------------
Kryo:
- using default instantiation: third party RCEs (commons-beanutils, spring)
- using StdInstantiatorStrategy: JDK only RCE

Mitigation: Enforce type registration

-------------------------------
Red5 AMF Marshalling:
-> JDK only RCE

Mitigation: Upgrade to 1.0.8 which enables type blacklisting :( of the
known bad ones

-------------------------------
SnakeYAML
-> JDK only RCE

Mitigation: Use SafeConstructor or a custom implementation for type
whitelisting.

-------------------------------
XStream
-> JDK only RCE

Mitigation: Use XStream's TypePermission for type whitelisting.

-------------------------------
YAMLBeans:
- third party library RCE (c3p0)

Mitigation: N/A

-------------------------------

Vulnerabilities where one of these was exploitable under some
circumstances identified as a part of this research and have been fixed
include:

- JBoss Resteasy - SnakeYAML (CVE-2016-9606)
- Apache Camel - SnakeYAML/Jackson/... (CVE-2017-3159,CVE-2016-8749)
- Apache Brooklyn - SnakeYAML (CVE-2016-8744)
- Jenkins - XStream (CVE-2017-2608)
- Red5 Media Server/Apache OpenMeetings (CVE-2017-5878)
- Magnolia CMS - json-io (CVE N/A, tracking MGNLCACHE-165)
- OpenNMS - Castor (CVE N/A, tracking NMS-9099/9100)
- Atlassian Bamboo - XStream (CVE 2016-5229)
- Adobe Coldfusion - BlazeDS (CVE 2017-3066)

Other affected instances, which have been reported but the author hasn't
recently received feedback on their current state include: Caucho Resin
(Hessian), Netflix Eureka (XStream), Amazon's AWS Simple Workflow
Library (Jackson).

Moritz

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-21 13:23:01 UTC  ``` Apache CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code is not using a constant time MAC signature comparison algorithm which may be exploited by some sophisticated timing attacks. It may only affect OAuth2 Hawk or JWT access tokens or JOSE JWS/JWE interceptors which depend on HMac secret key algorithms.  This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.0.13, 3.1.10.  Upstream patches:  CXF 3.1.x: <http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/555843f9>  CXF 3.0.x <http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/1338469f>  CXF 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT (master): <http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/e66ce235>  External References:  <https://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2017-3156.txt.asc>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-21 13:31:30 UTC  ``` Created cxf tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1425458](show_bug.cgi?id=1425458 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-3156 cxf: CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code are vulnerable to timing attacks [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c4)  Hamed Farid    2017-04-03 07:36:23 UTC  ``` Thanks Adam , I have two questions 1- If I use vulnerable CXF version like 3.0.12 but I don't use OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE , should I still be vulnerable ? 2- Is this finding affects only Linux systems ?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c5)  Hooman Broujerdi    2017-05-02 05:10:48 UTC  ``` Hi Hamed,  Sorry for the delay getting back to you on this, to answer your questions: 1) No you are not vulnerable, basically there multiple access token types which can be used in cxf oauth2 and MAC and HAWK are among those token types so if you do not use them then you are not vulnerable. 2) Not necessarily linux systems, cxf oauth2 lib is affected and any application that utilizes this lib and uses the HAWK and MAC  token types could potentially be impacted.  Hope this helps.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c6)  Hamed Farid    2017-05-02 05:17:29 UTC  ``` Thanks for your response   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-10 23:03:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse  Via RHSA-2017:1832 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1832](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1832)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c8)  Joshua Padman    2019-05-15 22:46:06 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is out of security support scope for the following products:  * Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6  * Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 5  * Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 6  * Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3  Please refer to <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes> for more details.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c9)  Joshua Padman    2019-06-19 05:57:25 UTC  ``` Whilst Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 7 and Red Hat SSO both include components of cxf the oauth2 components are not included.   ``` |  |

=== Content from camel.apache.org_10aca239_20250125_025819.html ===
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
CVE-2016-8749: Apache Camel's Jackson and JacksonXML unmarshalling operation are vulnerable
to Remote Code Execution attacks
Severity: MEDIUM
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected: Camel 2.16.0 to 2.16.4, Camel 2.17.0 to 2.17.4, Camel 2.18.0 to 2.18.1
The unsupported Camel 2.x (2.14 and earlier) versions may be also affected.
Description: Apache Camel's camel-jackson and camel-jacksonxml components are vulnerable to Java object
de-serialisation vulnerability. Camel allows to specify such a type through the 'CamelJacksonUnmarshalType'
property. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws as demonstrated in various similar reports about Java de-serialization issues.
Mitigation: 2.16.x users should upgrade to 2.16.5, 2.17.x users should upgrade to 2.17.5, 2.18.x users should
upgrade to 2.18.2.
The JIRA tickets: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-10567 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-10604
refers to the various commits that resovoled the issue, and have more details.

RHSA-2017:1832 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2017-08-10
Updated:
2017-08-10
# RHSA-2017:1832 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.3 R4 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the hawtio servlet uses a single HttpClient instance to proxy requests with a persistent cookie store (cookies are stored locally and are not passed between the client and the end URL) which means all clients using that proxy are sharing the same cookies. (CVE-2017-2589)
* It was found that an information disclosure flaw in Bouncy Castle could enable a local malicious application to gain access to user's private information. (CVE-2015-6644)
* It was found that Apache Camel's camel-jackson and camel-jacksonxml components are vulnerable to Java object de-serialisation vulnerability. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws as demonstrated in various similar reports about Java de-serialization issues. (CVE-2016-8749)
* It was found that Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded / to a request an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. (CVE-2016-9879)
* It was found that a path traversal vulnerability in hawtio leads to a NullPointerException with a full stacktrace. An attacker could use this flaw to gather undisclosed information from within hawtio's root. (CVE-2017-2594)
* It was found that Apache CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code is not using a constant time MAC signature comparison algorithm which may be exploited by some sophisticated timing attacks. It may only affect OAuth2 Hawk, JWT access tokens, or JOSE JWS/JWE interceptors which depend on HMAC secret key algorithms. (CVE-2017-3156)
* It was found that Apache Camel's validation component evaluates DTD headers of XML stream sources, although a validation against XML schemas (XSD) is executed. Remote attackers can use this feature to make Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by sending XML documents with remote DTDs URLs or XML External Entities (XXE). (CVE-2017-5643)
* It was found that a flaw exists in JAX-RS clients using the streaming approach for XML signatures and encryption, where it does not enforce the message to be signed/encrypted. This could allow an attacker to subvert the integrity of the message. (CVE-2017-5653)
* It was found that the token cacher in Apache cxf uses a flawed way of caching tokens that are associated with the delegation token received from Security Token Service (STS). This vulnerability could allow an attacker to craft a token which could return an identifier corresponding to a cached token for another user. (CVE-2017-5656)
* It was found that logback is vulnerable to a deserialization issue. Logback can be configured to allow remote logging through SocketServer/ServerSocketReceiver interfaces that can accept untrusted serialized data. Authenticated attackers on the adjacent network can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code through deserialization of custom gadget chains. (CVE-2017-5929)
* It was found that XStream contains a vulnerability that allows a maliciously crafted file to be parsed successfully which could cause an application crash. The crash occurs if the file that is being fed into XStream input stream contains an instances of the primitive type 'void'. An attacker could use this flaw to create a denial of service on the target system. (CVE-2017-7957)

The CVE-2017-2589 issue was discovered by Adam Willard (Blue Canopy) and Dennis Reed (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-2594 issue was discovered by Hooman Broujerdi (Red Hat).
