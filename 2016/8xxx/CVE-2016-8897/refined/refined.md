Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1) SQL Injection (sqli-1):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `product_id` parameter in `/framework/modules/ecommerce/controllers/cartController.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `product_id` parameter in the URL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker can be unauthenticated.

**2) SQL Injection (sqli-2):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `version` and `title` parameters in `/framework/modules/help/controllers/helpController.php` are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `version` and `title` parameters in the URL.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can be unauthenticated.

**3) Object Injection (Object Injection -1):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `mod` and `change_tag` parameters in `/framework/modules/core/controllers/expTagController.php` are not validated and are directly used to instantiate an object.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Object Injection, which can be leveraged for XXE (XML External Entity) attacks.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially trigger XXE attacks which can lead to SSRF, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `mod` and `change_tag` parameters in the URL. The provided exploit uses `SimpleXMLElement` class with a crafted XML payload to trigger XXE.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker can be unauthenticated.

**4) Object Injection (Object Injection -2):**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `mod` and `change_cat` parameters in `/framework/modules/core/controllers/expCatController.php` are not validated and are directly used to instantiate an object.
*   **Vulnerability:** Object Injection, which can be leveraged for XXE attacks.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can potentially trigger XXE attacks which can lead to SSRF, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*  **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `mod` and `change_cat` parameters in the URL. The provided exploit uses `SimpleXMLElement` class with a crafted XML payload to trigger XXE.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker can be unauthenticated.

**Additional Notes from the Github Diff:**

*   The provided GitHub commit diff shows code changes that address the vulnerabilities. The changes mainly involve sanitizing user inputs using the `expString::escape()` method before using them in SQL queries and also sanitizing the tag parameter.
* The commit diff also shows a fix in  `framework/core/models/expRecord.php` by sanitizing the order parameter with  `expString::escape($order);`.
