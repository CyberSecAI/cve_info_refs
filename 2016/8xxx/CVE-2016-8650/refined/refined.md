{
  "CVE-2016-8650": {
    "description": "The mpi_powm function in lib/mpi/mpi-pow.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11 does not ensure that memory is allocated for limb data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) via an add_key system call for an RSA key with a zero exponent.",
    "root_cause": "The `mpi_powm` function does not allocate memory for limb data when handling a zero exponent, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory allocation",
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user can cause a denial-of-service (kernel crash/panic) and potentially corrupt stack memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local system access via crafted RSA key"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local access to the system with the ability to make `add_key` system calls.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a specially crafted RSA key with a zero exponent to the `keyctl` interface. This affects systems using RSA keys and X.509 certificates."
