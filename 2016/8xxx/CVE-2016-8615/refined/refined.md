  "CVE-2016-8615": {
    "description": "If cookie state is written into a cookie jar file that is later read back and used for subsequent requests, a malicious HTTP server can inject new cookies for arbitrary domains into said cookie jar.",
    "root_cause": "The function that loads cookies into memory reads the specified file into a fixed-size buffer in a line-by-line manner using `fgets()`. If an invocation of fgets() cannot read the whole line into the destination buffer due to it being too small, it truncates the output, leading to the ability to inject new cookies.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient buffer size",
      "Improper input validation"

    "impact": "A malicious HTTP server can inject new cookies for arbitrary domains into a cookie jar.",

    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious HTTP server",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises from the way libcurl loads cookies from a file. Due to a fixed-size buffer and truncation when reading long lines, a malicious server can inject crafted cookies."

    "CVE-2016-8616": {
    "description": "When re-using a connection, curl was doing case insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing connections. This means that if an unused connection with proper credentials exists for a protocol that has connection-scoped credentials, an attacker can cause that connection to be reused if s/he knows the case-insensitive version of the correct password.",

    "description": "The libcurl API function called `curl_maprintf()` before version 7.51.0 can be tricked into doing a double-free due to an unsafe `size_t` multiplication, on systems using 32 bit `size_t` variables.",

    "description": "Multiple integer overflow flaws leading to heap-based buffer overflows were found in the way curl handled escaping and unescaping of data.
