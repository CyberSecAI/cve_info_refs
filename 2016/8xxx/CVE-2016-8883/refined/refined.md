      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check before applying an inverse intercomponent transform (RCT/ICT) in the jpc_dec_tiledecode function of the JasPer library. The function asserts that the number of components (dec->numcomps) is greater than or equal to 3 when performing the RCT or ICT. When a specially crafted JPEG2000 file does not meet this condition, an assertion fails which could be used for denial of service.",

      "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by providing a crafted JPEG2000 file that triggers an assertion failure and causes the application using the Jasper library to terminate.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By providing a malformed JPEG-2000 image file"
