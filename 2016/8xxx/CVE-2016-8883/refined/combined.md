# USN-3693-1: JasPer vulnerabilities

27 June 2018

Several security issues were fixed in JasPer.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [jasper](/security/cves?package=jasper) - Library for manipulating JPEG-2000 files

## Details

It was discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled certain malformed

JPEG-2000 image files. If a user or automated system using JasPer were

tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [libjasper1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper)
  -
  [1.900.1-debian1-2.4ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper/1.900.1-debian1-2.4ubuntu1.2)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libjasper1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper)
  -
  [1.900.1-14ubuntu3.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper/1.900.1-14ubuntu3.5)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

4](show_bug.cgi?id=1393882#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2017-03-29 13:32:35 UTC  ``` This is one of the problems that were already discussed as part of [CVE-2015-5203](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5203), see [bug 1254242 comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1254242#c11 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-5203 jasper: integer overflow in jas_image_cmpt_create()").  There was an integer overflow problem in the jas_image_cmpt_create() function.  Earlier patches ensured that the result of the multiplication can fit into size_t type, but later passed the value to the jas_stream_memopen() function, which size with the type of int.  This integer truncation could lead to bypass of the original integer overflow fix.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1393882#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-09 17:18:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:1208 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1208](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1208)   ``` |  |

Great job. I also was waiting for the next release to re-fuzz

This is a duplicate of the double-free I reported, but upstream
said that he can't reproduce.
