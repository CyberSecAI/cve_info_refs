- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Change Password" functionality of the Moxa AWK-3131A Web Application transmits the new password in cleartext as HTTP POST parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive data (password).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker intercepting the traffic can obtain valid credentials, potentially allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Network interception of HTTP traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the user's browser and the Moxa device. This could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack on the same network as the device or by compromising a network device involved in the communication path.
