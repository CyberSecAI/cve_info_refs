Message-ID: <1215560150.734283.1476367628231.JavaMail.zimbra@redhat.com>
Date: Thu, 13 Oct 2016 10:07:08 -0400 (EDT)
From: CAI Qian <caiqian@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: kernel - local DoS due to a page lock order bug in the
 XFS seek hole/data implementation

Running the trinity syscall fuzzer inside a docker container as an non-privileged user below,

$ trinity -g vfs --arch 64 --disable-fds=sockets --disable-fds=perf --disable-fds=epoll
--disable-fds=eventfd --disable-fds=pseudo --disable-fds=timerfd --disable-fds=memfd
--disable-fds=drm

always trigger a deadlock/hang at the fdatasync() syscall within 30 minutes with traces
(including sysrq-w info as well) like this, <http://people.redhat.com/qcai/tmp/dmesg>

This can be reproduced on any kernel post v4.4-rc1 as long as including this commit.

fc0561cefc04e7803c0f6501ca4f310a502f65b8
xfs: optimise away log forces on timestamp updates for fdatasync

Reverted the above commit against the latest mainline allows the trinity to run more than
10 hours without any deadlock/hang.

This had also been reported to the XFS maintainer and diagnosed as a page lock order bug
in the XFS seek hole/data implementation and presumably is still working on a fix better
than to revert the above commit.

If so where?  Regards, Salvatore   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1384851#c7)  Vladis Dronov    2018-02-26 12:11:10 UTC  ``` hello, Salvatore,  unfortunately, we are not aware of such a fix.  i've searched upstream's git-log for something like "Fixes: fc0561ce" or "CVE-2016-8660" but unfortunately/expectedly have not found anything.  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/118> says:  > This had also been reported to the XFS maintainer and diagnosed as > a page lock order bug in the XFS seek hole/data implementation and > presumably is still working on a fix better than to revert the above commit.  so i guess this thread is a proper place to check. unfortunately, i cannot find any message mentioning "fc0561cef" in linux-xfs@.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1384851#c8)  Vladis Dronov    2018-02-26 12:18:50 UTC  ``` hello, Salvatore,  (god bless marc.info) the thread in question is:  <https://marc.info/?t=147560293400001&r=1&w=2>  or:  <https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-xfs/msg01367.html>  <https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-xfs/msg01365.html>   ``` |  |
