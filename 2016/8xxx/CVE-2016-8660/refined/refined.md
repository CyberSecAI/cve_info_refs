Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a page lock order bug within the XFS file system's seek hole/data implementation. This issue was introduced by commit `fc0561cefc04e7803c0f6501ca4f310a502f65b8`, which aimed to optimize log forces on timestamp updates for `fdatasync`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Page Lock Ordering Issue**: Incorrect ordering when acquiring page locks in the XFS seek hole/data implementation.
*   The optimization introduced in the commit `fc0561cefc04e7803c0f6501ca4f310a502f65b8` triggered the page lock issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local user can trigger a deadlock or system hang by repeatedly calling `fdatasync()`. This effectively renders the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access**: The vulnerability can be triggered by a non-privileged local user within a docker container.
*   **System Call Fuzzing:** The `trinity` syscall fuzzer can reliably trigger the deadlock using the `vfs` syscall group.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:**  The attacker needs to have a local account on the system.
*   **Container Environment:** The exploit requires running within a container environment using XFS for storage, specifically with `overlay2` or `devicemapper` with an LVM thin pool.
*   **Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary programs to run the `trinity` fuzzer.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was reported to the XFS maintainer, who diagnosed it as a page lock ordering bug.
*   Reverting commit `fc0561cefc04e7803c0f6501ca4f310a502f65b8` prevents the deadlock.
*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions 4.4-rc1 and later that include the problematic commit.
*  The issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and MRG-2 because the flawed code was not present in those products.
*   The fix is still being worked on.
