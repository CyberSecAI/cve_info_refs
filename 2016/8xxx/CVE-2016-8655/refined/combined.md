## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise

## Details

USN-3149-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 LTS.

Philip Pettersson discovered a race condition in the af\_packet

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or run arbitrary code with

administrative privileges.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.105.96](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-105.152~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-105-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-105.152~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-105.152~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.105.96](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-105.152~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-105-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-105.152~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-105.152~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Subject: CVE-2016-8655 Linux af_packet.c race condition (local root)

Hello,

This is an announcement about CVE-2016-8655 which is a race-condition
I found in Linux (net/packet/af_packet.c). It can be exploited to gain
kernel code execution from unprivileged processes.

The bug was introduced on Aug 19, 2011:
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f6fb8f100b807378fda19e83e5ac6828b638603a>

Fixed on Nov 30, 2016:
<https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=84ac7260236a49c79eede91617700174c2c19b0c>

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=   BUG DETAILS  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

To create AF_PACKET sockets you need CAP_NET_RAW in your network
namespace, which can be acquired by unprivileged processes on
systems where unprivileged namespaces are enabled (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc).
It can be triggered from within containers to compromise the host kernel.
On Android, processes with gid=3004/AID_NET_RAW are able to create
AF_PACKET sockets (mediaserver) and can trigger the bug.

I found the bug by reading code paths that have been opened up by the
emergence of unprivileged namespaces, something I think should be
off by default in all Linux distributions given its history of
security vulnerabilities.

The problem is inside packet_set_ring() and packet_setsockopt().
We can reach packet_set_ring() by calling setsockopt() on the socket
using the PACKET_RX_RING option.

If the version of the packet socket is TPACKET_V3, a timer_list
object will be initialized by packet_set_ring() when it calls
init_prb_bdqc().

...
                switch (po->tp_version) {
                case TPACKET_V3:
                /* Transmit path is not supported. We checked
                 * it above but just being paranoid
                 */
                        if (!tx_ring)
                                init_prb_bdqc(po, rb, pg_vec, req_u);
                        break;
                default:
                        break;
                }
...

The function flow to set up the timer is:
packet_set_ring()->init_prb_bdqc()->prb_setup_retire_blk_timer()->
prb_init_blk_timer()->prb_init_blk_timer()->init_timer()

When the socket is closed, packet_set_ring() is called again
to free the ring buffer and delete the previously initialized
timer if the packet version is > TPACKET_V2:

...
        if (closing && (po->tp_version > TPACKET_V2)) {
                /* Because we don't support block-based V3 on tx-ring */
                if (!tx_ring)
                        prb_shutdown_retire_blk_timer(po, rb_queue);
        }
...

The issue is that we can change the packet version to TPACKET_V1
with packet_setsockopt() after init_prb_bdqc() has been executed
and before packet_set_ring() has returned.

There is an attempt to deny changing socket versions after a ring
buffer has been initialized, but it is insufficient:

...
        case PACKET_VERSION:
        {
...
                if (po->rx_ring.pg_vec || po->tx_ring.pg_vec)
                        return -EBUSY;
...

There's plenty of room to race this code path between the calls to
init_prb_bdqc() and swap(rb->pg_vec, pg_vec) in packet_set_ring().

When the socket is closed, packet_set_ring() will not delete the
timer since the socket version is now TPACKET_V1. The struct
timer_list that describes the timer object is located inside the
struct packet_sock for the socket itself however and will be
freed with a call to kfree().

We then have a use-after-free on a timer object that can be
exploited by various poisoning attacks on the SLAB allocator (I find
add_key() to be the most reliable). This will ultimately lead to the
kernel jumping to a manipulated function pointer when the timer expires.

The bug is fixed by taking lock_sock(sk) in packet_setsockopt() when
changing the packet version while also taking the lock at the start
of packet_set_ring().

My exploit defeats SMEP/SMAP and will give a rootshell on Ubuntu 16.04,
I will hold off a day on publishing it so people have some time to update.

New Ubuntu kernels are out so please update as soon as possible.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for the Linux Kernel 3.12.60-52\_49 fixes several issues.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2016-8655: A race condition in the af\_packet packet\_set\_ring
function could be used by local attackers to crash the kernel or gain
privileges (bsc#1012759).
- CVE-2016-9555: The sctp\_sf\_ootb function in net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c in
the Linux kernel lacks chunk-length checking for the first chunk, which
allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
slab access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted SCTP
data (bsc#1012183).
Patch Instructions:
To install this SUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3151-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Philip Pettersson discovered a race condition in the af\_packet

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or run arbitrary code with

administrative privileges.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

```
1) Blocks can be configured with non-static frame-size.
2) Read/poll is at a block-level(as opposed to packet-level).
3) Added poll timeout to avoid indefinite user-space wait on idle links.
4) Added user-configurable knobs:
   4.1) block::timeout.
   4.2) tpkt_hdr::sk_rxhash.

Changes:
C1) tpacket_rcv()
    C1.1) packet_current_frame() is replaced by packet_current_rx_frame()
          The bulk of the processing is then moved in the following chain:
          packet_current_rx_frame()
            __packet_lookup_frame_in_block
              fill_curr_block()
              or
                retire_current_block
                dispatch_next_block
              or
              return NULL(queue is plugged/paused)

packet: fix race condition in packet\_set\_ringWhen packet\_set\_ring creates a ring buffer it will initialize a
struct timer\_list if the packet version is TPACKET\_V3. This value
can then be raced by a different thread calling setsockopt to
set the version to TPACKET\_V1 before packet\_set\_ring has finished.
This leads to a use-after-free on a function pointer in the
struct timer\_list when the socket is closed as the previously
initialized timer will not be deleted.
The bug is fixed by taking lock\_sock(sk) in packet\_setsockopt when
changing the packet version while also taking the lock at the start
of packet\_set\_ring.

# Android Security Bulletin—March 2017

Stay organized with collections

*Published March 06, 2017 | Updated March 07, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of March 05, 2017 or later address all of these
issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on February 06,
2017 or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-03-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-03-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-03-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-03-01
    and 2017-03-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the March
  05, 2017 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-03-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-03-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-03-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-03-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-03-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-03-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the March 1, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of March 5, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-03-01](#2017-03-01-details) and
[2017-03-05](#2017-03-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

# USN-3151-3: Linux kernel (Qualcomm Snapdragon) vulnerability

5 December 2016

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon Processors

## Details

Philip Pettersson discovered a race condition in the af\_packet

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or run arbitrary code with

administrative privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1039-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon)
  -
  [4.4.0-1039.43](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon/4.4.0-1039.43)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3150-2: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerability

6 December 2016

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Philip Pettersson discovered a race condition in the af\_packet

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or run arbitrary code with

administrative privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1496-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1496.123](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1496.123)
* [linux-image-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0.1496.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1496.123)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

There are offsets included for older kernels, but they're untested
so be aware that this exploit will probably crash kernels older than 4.4.

tested on:
Ubuntu 16.04: 4.4.0-51-generic
Ubuntu 16.04: 4.4.0-47-generic
Ubuntu 16.04: 4.4.0-36-generic
Ubuntu 14.04: 4.4.0-47-generic #68~14.04.1-Ubuntu

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1400019#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-11-30 10:02:22 UTC  ``` A race condition vulnerability was found in packet_set_ring that can lead to use after free on a function pointer. This vulnerability can be used to gain kernel code execution for the local attacker capable of creating AF_PACKET sockets. This issue was introduced with following commit:  <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f6fb8f100b807378fda19e83e5ac6828b638603a>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1400019#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-11-30 10:02:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Philip Pettersson   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1400019#c4)  Andrej Nemec    2016-12-06 08:10:58 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1401820](show_bug.cgi?id=1401820 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-8655 kernel: Race condition in packet_set_ring leads to use after free [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1400019#c5)  Andrej Nemec    2016-12-06 08:11:21 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/607>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1400019#c6)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-06 08:12:51 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=84ac7260236a49c79eede91617700174c2c19b0c>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1400019#c7)  Petr Matousek    2016-12-06 09:15:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  This issue does affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future updates for the respective releases will address this issue.  In a default or common use of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 this issue does not allow an unprivileged local user elevate their privileges on the system.  In order to exploit this issue the attacker needs CAP_NET_RAW capability, which needs to be granted by the administrator to the attacker's account. Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not have unprivileged user namespaces enabled by default, local unprivileged users also cannot abuse namespaces to grant this capability to themselves and elevate their privileges.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1400019#c22)  dafox7777777    2017-01-24 08:52:34 UTC  ``` bump   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1400019#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-03-02 16:04:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2017:0402 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0402.html>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1400019#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-03-02 17:16:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:0386 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0386.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1400019#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-03-02 17:25:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:0387 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0387.html>   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0386)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (CONFIG\_KVM) support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference flaw. It could occur on x86 platform, when emulating an undefined instruction. An attacker could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS. (CVE-2016-8630, Important)
* A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem handled synchronization while creating the TPACKET\_V3 ring buffer. A local user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP\_NET\_RAW capability) could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-8655, Important)
* A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's implementation of VFIO. An attacker issuing an ioctl can create a situation where memory is corrupted and modify memory outside of the expected area. This may overwrite kernel memory and subvert kernel execution. (CVE-2016-9083, Important)
* The use of a kzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an integer overflow condition to be reached in vfio\_pci\_intrs.c. This combined with CVE-2016-9083 may allow an attacker to craft an attack and use unallocated memory, potentially crashing the machine. (CVE-2016-9084, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Philip Pettersson for reporting CVE-2016-8655.

Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2016:3117-1
Rating: important
References: #1012183 #1012759
Cross-References: CVE-2016-8655 CVE-2016-9555
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Live Patching 12
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for the Linux Kernel 3.12.59-60\_41 fixes several issues.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2016-8655: A race condition in the af\_packet packet\_set\_ring
function could be used by local attackers to crash the kernel or gain
privileges (bsc#1012759).
- CVE-2016-9555: The sctp\_sf\_ootb function in net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c in
the Linux kernel lacks chunk-length checking for the first chunk, which
allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
slab access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted SCTP
data (bsc#1012183).
Patch Instructions:
To install this SUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Live Patching 12:
zypper in -t patch SUSE-SLE-Live-Patching-12-2016-1812=1
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Philip Pettersson discovered a race condition in the af\_packet

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or run arbitrary code with

administrative privileges.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-53-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-53.74](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-53.74)

* [linux-image-4.4.0-53-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-53.74](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-53.74)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

        This module exploits a race condition and use-after-free in the
        packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c (AF_PACKET) in
        the Linux kernel to execute code as root (CVE-2016-8655).

        The bug was initially introduced in 2011 and patched in 2016 in version
        4.4.0-53.74, potentially affecting a large number of kernels; however
        this exploit targets only systems using Ubuntu (Trusty / Xenial) kernels
        4.4.0 < 4.4.0-53, including Linux distros based on Ubuntu, such as
        Linux Mint.

        The target system must have unprivileged user namespaces enabled and
        two or more CPU cores.

        Bypasses for SMEP, SMAP and KASLR are included. Failed exploitation
        may crash the kernel.

        This module has been tested successfully on Linux Mint 17.3 (x86_64);
        Linux Mint 18 (x86_64); and Ubuntu 16.04.2 (x86_64) with kernel
        versions 4.4.0-45-generic and 4.4.0-51-generic.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# USN-3152-2: Linux kernel (Raspberry Pi 2) vulnerability

6 December 2016

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.10](/security/notices?release=yakkety)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Philip Pettersson discovered a race condition in the af\_packet

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or run arbitrary code with

administrative privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.10

* [linux-image-4.8.0-1020-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.8.0-1020.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.8.0-1020.23)
* [linux-image-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.8.0.1020.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.8.0-1020.23)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# USN-3151-4: Linux kernel (Raspberry Pi 2) vulnerability

5 December 2016

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Philip Pettersson discovered a race condition in the af\_packet

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or run arbitrary code with

administrative privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1034-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.4.0-1034.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1034.41)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3151-1: Linux kernel vulnerability

5 December 2016

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Philip Pettersson discovered a race condition in the af\_packet

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or run arbitrary code with

administrative privileges.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-53-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-53.74](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-53.74)

  -

  -
  [4.4.0-53.74](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-53.74)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Linux Kernel Live Patch 15 for SLE 12
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2016:3197-1
Rating: important
References: #1012183 #1012759
Cross-References: CVE-2016-8655 CVE-2016-9555
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP 12
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12-LTSS
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for the Linux Kernel 3.12.60-52\_54 fixes several issues.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2016-8655: A race condition in the af\_packet packet\_set\_ring
function could be used by local attackers to crash the kernel or gain
privileges (bsc#1012759).
- CVE-2016-9555: The sctp\_sf\_ootb function in net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c in
the Linux kernel lacks chunk-length checking for the first chunk, which
allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
slab access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted SCTP
data (bsc#1012183).
Patch Instructions:
To install this SUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP 12:
zypper in -t patch SUSE-SLE-SAP-12-2016-1855=1
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12-LTSS:
zypper in -t patch SUSE-SLE-SERVER-12-2016-1855=1
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

packet: fix race condition in packet\_set\_ringWhen packet\_set\_ring creates a ring buffer it will initialize a
struct timer\_list if the packet version is TPACKET\_V3. This value
can then be raced by a different thread calling setsockopt to
set the version to TPACKET\_V1 before packet\_set\_ring has finished.
This leads to a use-after-free on a function pointer in the
struct timer\_list when the socket is closed as the previously
initialized timer will not be deleted.
The bug is fixed by taking lock\_sock(sk) in packet\_setsockopt when
changing the packet version while also taking the lock at the start
of packet\_set\_ring.

packet: fix race condition in packet\_set\_ringWhen packet\_set\_ring creates a ring buffer it will initialize a
struct timer\_list if the packet version is TPACKET\_V3. This value
can then be raced by a different thread calling setsockopt to
set the version to TPACKET\_V1 before packet\_set\_ring has finished.
This leads to a use-after-free on a function pointer in the
struct timer\_list when the socket is closed as the previously
initialized timer will not be deleted.
The bug is fixed by taking lock\_sock(sk) in packet\_setsockopt when
changing the packet version while also taking the lock at the start
of packet\_set\_ring.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0387)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (CONFIG\_KVM) support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference flaw. It could occur on x86 platform, when emulating an undefined instruction. An attacker could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS. (CVE-2016-8630, Important)
* A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem handled synchronization while creating the TPACKET\_V3 ring buffer. A local user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP\_NET\_RAW capability) could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-8655, Important)
* A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's implementation of VFIO. An attacker issuing an ioctl can create a situation where memory is corrupted and modify memory outside of the expected area. This may overwrite kernel memory and subvert kernel execution. (CVE-2016-9083, Important)
* The use of a kzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an integer overflow condition to be reached in vfio\_pci\_intrs.c. This combined with CVE-2016-9083 may allow an attacker to craft an attack and use unallocated memory, potentially crashing the machine. (CVE-2016-9084, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Philip Pettersson for reporting CVE-2016-8655.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the asynchronous page fault woke code references spinlocks, which were actually sleeping locks in the RT kernel. Because of this, when the code was executed from the exception context, a bug warning appeared on the console. With this update, the regular wait queue and spinlock code in this area has been modified to use simple-wait-queue and raw-spinlocks. This code change enables the asynchronous page fault code to run in a non-preemptable state without bug warnings. (BZ#1418035)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0402)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem handled synchronization while creating the TPACKET\_V3 ring buffer. A local user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP\_NET\_RAW capability) could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-8655, Important)

Red Hat would like to thank Philip Pettersson for reporting this issue.

Enhancement(s):

* Previously, the Broadcom bnx2x driver in the MRG kernel-rt used an incorrect PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) timer divisor value, which broke Precision Time Protocol (PTP) timestamping due to an unstable clock. This update corrects the divisor value, and the PTP timestamping is now accurate, with monotonically increasing timestamp values. (BZ#1411139)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

* MRG Realtime 2 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1400019](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1400019)
  - CVE-2016-8655 kernel: Race condition in packet\_set\_ring leads to use after free
* [BZ - 1414055](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1414055)
  - update the MRG 2.5.z 3.10 kernel-rt sources

## CVEs

* [CVE-2016-8655](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2016-8655.html)

# USN-3152-1: Linux kernel vulnerability

5 December 2016

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.10](/security/notices?release=yakkety)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Philip Pettersson discovered a race condition in the af\_packet

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or run arbitrary code with

administrative privileges.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

packet: fix race condition in packet\_set\_ring

```
When packet_set_ring creates a ring buffer it will initialize a
struct timer_list if the packet version is TPACKET_V3. This value
can then be raced by a different thread calling setsockopt to
set the version to TPACKET_V1 before packet_set_ring has finished.

This leads to a use-after-free on a function pointer in the
struct timer_list when the socket is closed as the previously
initialized timer will not be deleted.

The bug is fixed by taking lock_sock(sk) in packet_setsockopt when
changing the packet version while also taking the lock at the start
of packet_set_ring.

An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for the Linux Kernel 3.12.59-60\_45 fixes several issues.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2016-8655: A race condition in the af\_packet packet\_set\_ring
function could be used by local attackers to crash the kernel or gain
privileges (bsc#1012759).
- CVE-2016-9555: The sctp\_sf\_ootb function in net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c in
the Linux kernel lacks chunk-length checking for the first chunk, which
allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
slab access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted SCTP
data (bsc#1012183).
Patch Instructions:
To install this SUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Live Patching 12:
