{
  "CVE-2016-8655": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the af_packet implementation within the Linux kernel, specifically in the packet_set_ring and packet_setsockopt functions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient locking when changing the packet version after the ring buffer is initialized, leading to a use-after-free condition on a timer object.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local, unprivileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (system crash) or achieve arbitrary code execution with administrative privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local, unprivileged attacker can create an AF_PACKET socket and then trigger the race condition.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the CAP_NET_RAW capability, which is available by default in unprivileged namespaces enabled in systems such as Ubuntu and Fedora, or by having gid=3004/AID_NET_RAW on Android."
