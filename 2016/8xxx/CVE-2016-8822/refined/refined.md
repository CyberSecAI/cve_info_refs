- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape with specific IDs (0x600000E, 0x600000F, and 0x6000010) uses a value passed from user space as an index to an internal array without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input validation. Specifically, the driver does not validate user-provided index before using it to access an internal array.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) and potentially an escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring a low privilege user on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system and be able to interact with the NVIDIA driver through the DxgkDdiEscape interface.
