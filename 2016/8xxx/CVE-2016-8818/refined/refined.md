The provided content is related to CVE-2016-8818.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape`. A pointer passed from a user to the driver is used without validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation of a user-supplied pointer before its use within the kernel driver. This constitutes an insecure pointer dereference vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to denial of service (DoS) or potential escalation of privileges.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. A user-mode application can pass a crafted pointer to the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler in the kernel-mode driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to interact with the NVIDIA display driver. A low-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability.
