  "CVE-2016-8705": {
    "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in process_bin_update function which is responsible for processing multiple commands of Memcached binary protocol can be abused to cause heap overflow and lead to remote code execution.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the `process_bin_update` function due to difference in signedness between `bodylen` (unsigned) and `vlen` (signed) causing a negative value for `vlen`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution, denial of service via daemon crash.  Can be abused to modify internal slab metadata, and can be abused to cause information leaks required for successful exploitation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted binary protocol message to memcached server."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker with network access to a memcached server."
  }
}
