### CVE-2016-8809
- **Vulnerability:** Incorrect Bounds Check
- **Location:** NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape ID 0x70001b2.
- **Root Cause:** The size of an input buffer is not validated. Specifically, the `escape_->size` (controlled by the user) is used to limit the size in a `memcpy` operation, but this check is insufficient to prevent out-of-bounds access.
- **Attack Vector:** A user can pass a crafted size value to DxgkDdiEscape ID 0x70001b2.
- **Impact:** Denial of service or potential escalation of privileges.
- **Details:** Before escape handlers are executed, `PrivateDriverDataSize` (from `DXGKARG_ESCAPE`) is checked against a hardcoded table. However, some escapes allow a relaxed check that `PrivateDriverDataSize` >= minimum. This means that the handler itself must implement an ad hoc bounds check, which can be missing or implemented incorrectly, relying on a user-specified value.
