- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control leading to the ability to execute arbitrary OS commands through the web console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary OS commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server leading to complete compromise of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation through the web console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the web console. A high level of privileges is required, however, the vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to gain these privileges.
