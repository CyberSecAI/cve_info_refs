The provided content is a security advisory from Huawei regarding CVE-2016-8768.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A failure in the Privileged Execute-Never (PXN) defense mechanism within the drive code of certain Huawei mobile phones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the drive code, which can be exploited to bypass the PXN defense.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a system crash or privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain elevated privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector involves tricking users into installing malicious applications on their phones.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince the user to install a malicious application. This suggests the attacker needs social engineering skills to successfully distribute the malicious app. The malicious application then invokes the vulnerable drive code.

The advisory also includes:
- Affected and fixed software versions for Honor 6, Honor 6 Plus, and Honor 7.
- CVSS v2 score (Base Score: 6.2, Temporal Score: 5.1)
