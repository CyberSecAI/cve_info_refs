Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8907:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input used in the `ORDER BY` clause of SQL queries within the dotCMS application. Specifically, the `_EXT_STRUCTURE_orderBy` and `_EXT_STRUCTURE_direction` parameters, which control the sorting of content types, are directly concatenated into the SQL query without sufficient checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize user-controlled parameters before using them in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This type of injection is described as "Partly Blind SQL injection" as the attacker cannot use `UNION` to directly extract data but can use boolean conditions and time based techniques to extract information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could lead to:
   - Unauthorized access to sensitive database information.
   - Modification or deletion of data.
   - Potential compromise of the entire application and underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to specific URLs of the dotCMS application. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted request that includes malicious SQL code in the `_EXT_STRUCTURE_orderBy` and `_EXT_STRUCTURE_direction` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker must be authenticated to access the "Content Types > Content Types" screen in dotCMS where the vulnerable parameters are used.
   - The attacker needs knowledge of how to manipulate the vulnerable parameters to inject SQL commands.

**Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability exists in the "Content Types > Content Types" screen.
- The vulnerable parameters are `_EXT_STRUCTURE_orderBy` and `_EXT_STRUCTURE_direction`.
- The vulnerability was present in dotCMS versions before 3.3.1.
- The attack is described as a "Partly Blind SQL injection" due to the limitations of the injection point being within an `ORDER BY` clause
- The provided proof-of-concept URL is:
`/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=56fedb43-dbbf-4ce2-8b77-41fb73bad015&p_p_id=EXT_STRUCTURE&p_p_action=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_EXT_STRUCTURE_struts_action=%2Fext%2Fstructure%2Fview_structure&_EXT_STRUCTURE_orderBy=SQLi&_EXT_STRUCTURE_direction=SQLi`
- The issue was fixed in dotCMS version 3.3.1 and 3.5
