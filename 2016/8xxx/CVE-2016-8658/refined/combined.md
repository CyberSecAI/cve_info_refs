Subject: Re: CVE Request -- Broadcom Wifi Driver Brcmfmac brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap
 Buffer Overflow

hi,
    I found a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in Broadcom wifi driver
brcmfmac, this issue has been fixed, I would like to
request a CVE-ID for this issue.

Description
=========

Cfg80211 module in kernel is the main interface to operate on wifi.
This module defines an operation data structure which stores many
commands and callback functions to control the wifi, and those
callback functions are implemented in wifi driver finally, executables
can communicate with this module by netlink socket.

To trigger the bug the exploit should send a NL80211_CMD_START_AP or
NL80211_CMD_NEW_BEACON command to nl80211 socket in kernel.
NL80211_CMD_START_AP is equal with NL80211_CMD_NEW_BEACON according
with the definition in nl80211.h. Hostapd uses NL80211_CMD_NEW_BEACON.

       static struct genl_ops nl80211_ops[] = {
                 ...
                 {
                         .cmd = NL80211_CMD_START_AP,
                         .policy = nl80211_policy,
                         .flags = GENL_ADMIN_PERM,
                         .doit  = nl80211_start_ap,
                         .internal_flags = NL80211_FLAG_NEED_NETDEV_UP
| NL80211_FLAG_NEED_RTNL,
                 },
                 ...
       }

When kernel receives the NL80211_CMD_START_AP command then it will
call nl80211_start_ap function,  but it requries executable owns
CAP_NET_ADMIN permission.

In nl80211_start_ap, it will parse the data received from user, and
store the result in cfg80211_ap_settings structure。

       static int nl80211_start_ap( struct sk_buff *skb, struct
genl_info *info ) {
                ...
                struct cfg80211_ap_settings params;
                ...
                memset( &params,  0, sizeof(params) );
                ...
                err = nl80211_parse_beacon( info, &params.beacon );

                if ( info->attrs[NL80211_ATTR_SSID] ) {
                         params.ssid = nla_data(
info->attrs[NL80211_ATTR_SSID] );
                         params.ssid_len = nla_len(
info->attrs[NL80211_ATTR_SSID] );
                         if ( params.ssid_len == 0 || params.ssid_len
> IEEE80211_MAX_SSID_LEN )
                                 return -EINVAL;
                }

               ...
               err = rdev_start_ap( rdev, dev, &params );
               ...
       }

      struct cfg80211_ap_settings {
	    struct cfg80211_chan_def chandef;

	    struct cfg80211_beacon_data beacon;

	     int beacon_interval, dtim_period;
	     const u8 *ssid;
	     size_t ssid_len;
	     enum nl80211_hidden_ssid hidden_ssid;
	     struct cfg80211_crypto_settings crypto;
	     bool privacy;
	     enum nl80211_auth_type auth_type;
	     int inactivity_timeout;
	     u8 p2p_ctwindow;
	     bool p2p_opp_ps;
	     const struct cfg80211_acl_data *acl;
	     bool radar_required;
       };

       struct cfg80211_beacon_data {
              const u8 *head, *tail;
              const u8 *beacon_ies;
              const u8 *proberesp_ies;
              const u8 *assocresp_ies;
              const u8 *probe_resp;

             size_t head_len, tail_len;
             size_t beacon_ies_len;
             size_t proberesp_ies_len;
	     size_t assocresp_ies_len;
	     size_t probe_resp_len;
        };

It also does many checks, the interface type must be NL80211_IFTYPE_AP
or NL80211_IFTYPE_P2P_GO, and data must contain informations about
NL80211_ATTR_BEACON_INTERVAL, NL80211_ATTR_DTIM_PERIOD,
NL80211_ATTR_BEACON_HEAD. Finally it will call rdev_start_ap function.

NL80211_ATTR_SSID is optional, user can send a netlink packet which
does not contain information about NL80211_ATTR_SSID, so params.ssid
and params.ssid_len will be 0. It's the key point in the exploit.

       static inline int rdev_start_ap( struct
cfg80211_registered_device *rdev, struct net_device *dev, struct
cfg80211_ap_settings *settings ) {
                ...
                ret = rdev->ops->start_ap( &rdev->wiphy, dev, settings );
                ...
       }

rdev_start_ap will call the callback function defined in brcmfmac driver.

      static struct cfg80211_ops wl_cfg80211_ops = {
              ...
              .start_ap = brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap;
              ...
      }

If the netlink packet does not contian info about NL80211_ATTR_SSID,
brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap will call brcmf_parse_tlvs to parse head data
further. The data format is TLV (Type, Length, Value ),
it will parse type WLAN_EID_SSID info in data, all those datas are
controlled by user. It does not
check the length of data before calling memcpy to copy the data to
stack buffer. The length of stack buffer ssid_le.SSID is 32, so we can
construct a malicous data packet in NL80211_CMD_START_AP command, and
make WLAN_EID_SSID's length large then 32. When it copies the data, it
will overflow the stack buffer.

       brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap(   struct cfg80211_ap_settings *settings ) {
               s32  ie_offset;
               struct brcmf_tlv *ssid_ie;
               struct brcmf_ssid_le ssid_le;

               memset( &ssid_le, 0, sizeof(ssid_le) );

               if  ( settings->ssid == NULL || settings->ssid_len == 0 ) {
                        ie_offset = DOT11_MGMT_HDR_LEN +
DOT11_BCN_PRB_FIXED_LEN;
                        ssid_ie = brcmf_parse_tlvs( (u8
*)&settings->beacon.head[ie_offset], settings->beacon.head_len -
ie_offset, WLAN_EID_SSID );
                       if ( !ssid_ie )
                              return -EINVAL;

                      memcpy( ssid_le.SSID, ssid_ie->data,
ssid_ie->len );   //overflow here.
                      ssid_le.SSID_len = cpu_to_le32( ssid_ie->len );
               }
               else {
                      memcpy( ssid_le.SSID, settings->ssid,
settings->ssid_len );
                      ssid_le.SSID_len = cput_to_le32( (u32)settings->ssid_len);
               }
               ...
      }

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3146-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that the \_\_get\_user\_asm\_ex implementation in the Linux

kernel for x86/x86\_64 contained extended asm statements that were

incompatible with the exception table. A local attacker could use this to

gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-9644](/security/CVE-2016-9644))

Andreas Gruenbacher and Jan Kara discovered that the filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel did not clear the setgid bit during a

setxattr call. A local attacker could use this to possibly elevate group

privileges. ([CVE-2016-7097](/security/CVE-2016-7097))

Marco Grassi discovered that the driver for Areca RAID Controllers in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate control messages. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

privileges. ([CVE-2016-7425](/security/CVE-2016-7425))

Daxing Guo discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the Broadcom

IEEE802.11n FullMAC driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

privileges. ([CVE-2016-8658](/security/CVE-2016-8658))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

brcmfmac: avoid potential stack overflow in brcmf\_cfg80211\_start\_ap()User-space can choose to omit NL80211\_ATTR\_SSID and only provide raw
IE TLV data. When doing so it can provide SSID IE with length exceeding
the allowed size. The driver further processes this IE copying it
into a local variable without checking the length. Hence stack can be
corrupted and used as exploit.

# USN-3145-2: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

30 November 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise

## Details

USN-3145-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the

Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Marco Grassi discovered that the driver for Areca RAID Controllers in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate control messages. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

privileges. ([CVE-2016-7425](/security/CVE-2016-7425))

Daxing Guo discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the Broadcom

IEEE802.11n FullMAC driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

privileges. ([CVE-2016-8658](/security/CVE-2016-8658))

brcmfmac: avoid potential stack overflow in brcmf\_cfg80211\_start\_ap()

```
User-space can choose to omit NL80211_ATTR_SSID and only provide raw
IE TLV data. When doing so it can provide SSID IE with length exceeding
the allowed size. The driver further processes this IE copying it
into a local variable without checking the length. Hence stack can be
corrupted and used as exploit.

commit ea7190945a91e21e08761ae0d6fcec4f6dc89321
Author: Linus Torvalds

Add braces to avoid "ambiguous ‘else’" compiler warnings
commit 194dc870a5890e855ecffb30f3b80ba7c88f96d6 upstream.
Some of our "for\_each\_xyz()" macro constructs make gcc unhappy about
lack of braces around if-statements inside or outside the loop, because
the loop construct itself has a "if-then-else" statement inside of it.
The resulting warnings look something like this:
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915\_debugfs.c: In function ‘i915\_dump\_lrc’:
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915\_debugfs.c:2103:6: warning: suggest explicit braces to avoid ambiguous ‘else’ [-Wparentheses]
if (ctx != dev\_priv->kernel\_context)
^
even if the code itself is fine.
Since the warning is fairly easy to avoid by adding a braces around the
if-statement near the for\_each\_xyz() construct, do so, rather than
disabling the otherwise potentially useful warning.
(The if-then-else statements used in the "for\_each\_xyz()" constructs are
designed to be inherently safe even with no braces, but in this case
it's quite understandable that gcc isn't really able to tell that).
This finally leaves the standard "allmodconfig" build with just a
handful of remaining warnings, so new and valid warnings hopefully will
stand out.

aic5\_irq\_domain\_xlate() and aic\_irq\_domain\_xlate() take the generic chip
lock without disabling interrupts, which can lead to a deadlock if an

Replace irq\_gc\_{lock,unlock}() calls by
irq\_gc\_{lock\_irqsave,unlock\_irqrestore}() ones to prevent this bug from
happening.

A decent point was raised about minimising the use of a local variable that
we 'could' do without. I've chosen consistency over the possibility of
reducing the local variable count by 1. Thinking that it's more important
for the code to be grouped and authoured in a similar manner/style for
greater maintainability/readability.

commit bf2c4b6f9b74c2ee1dd3c050b181e9b9c86fbcdb upstream.
rsc\_lookup steals the passed-in memory to avoid doing an allocation of
its own, so we can't just pass in a pointer to memory that someone else
is using.
If we really want to avoid allocation there then maybe we should
preallocate somwhere, or reference count these handles.
For now we should revert.
On occasion I see this on my server:

drm: Only use compat ioctl for addfb2 on X86/IA64
commit 47a66e45d7a7613322549c2475ea9d809baaf514 upstream.
Similar to struct drm\_update\_draw, struct drm\_mode\_fb\_cmd2 has an
unaligned 64 bit field (modifier). This get packed differently between
32 bit and 64 bit modes on architectures that can handle unaligned 64
bit access (X86 and IA64). Other architectures pack the structs the
same and don't need the compat wrapper. Use the same condition for
drm\_mode\_fb\_cmd2 as we use for drm\_update\_draw.
Note that only the modifier will be packed differently between compat
and non-compat versions.

drm/i915: Ignore OpRegion panel type except on select machines
commit ea54ff4008892b46c7a3e6bc8ab8aaec9d198639 upstream.
Turns out
commit a05628195a0d ("drm/i915: Get panel\_type from OpRegion panel
details") has regressed quite a few machines. So it looks like we
can't use the panel type from OpRegion on all systems, and yet we
absolutely must use it on some specific systems.
Despite trying, I was unable to find any automagic way to determine
if the OpRegion panel type is respectable or not. The only glimmer
of hope I had was bit 8 in the SCIC response, but that turned out to
not work either (it was always 0 on both types of systems).
So, to fix the regressions without breaking the machine we know to need
the OpRegion panel type, let's just add a quirk for this. Only specific
machines known to require the OpRegion panel type will therefore use
it. Everyone else will fall bck to the VBT panel type.
The only known machine so far is a "Conrac GmbH IX45GM2". The PCI
subsystem ID on this machine is just a generic 8086:2a42, so of no use.
Instead we'll go with a DMI match.
I suspect we can now also revert
commit aeddda06c1a7 ("drm/i915: Ignore panel type from OpRegion on SKL")
but let's leave that to a separate patch.
v2: Do the DMI match in the opregion code directly, as dev\_priv->quirks
gets populated too late

kconfig: tinyconfig: provide whole choice blocks to avoid warnings
commit 236dec051078a8691950f56949612b4b74107e48 upstream.
Using "make tinyconfig" produces a couple of annoying warnings that show
up for build test machines all the time:
.config:966:warning: override: NOHIGHMEM changes choice state
.config:965:warning: override: SLOB changes choice state
.config:963:warning: override: KERNEL\_XZ changes choice state
.config:962:warning: override: CC\_OPTIMIZE\_FOR\_SIZE changes choice state
.config:933:warning: override: SLOB changes choice state
.config:930:warning: override: CC\_OPTIMIZE\_FOR\_SIZE changes choice state
.config:870:warning: override: SLOB changes choice state
.config:868:warning: override: KERNEL\_XZ changes choice state
.config:867:warning: override: CC\_OPTIMIZE\_FOR\_SIZE changes choice state
I've made a previous attempt at fixing them and we discussed a number of
alternatives.
I tried changing the Makefile to use "merge\_config.sh -n
$(fragment-list)" but couldn't get that to work properly.
This is yet another approach, based on the observation that we do want
to see a warning for conflicting 'choice' options, and that we can
simply make them non-conflicting by listing all other options as
disabled. This is a trivial patch that we can apply independent of
plans for other changes.

efi/libstub: Introduce ExitBootServices helper
commit fc07716ba803483be91bc4b2344f9c84985e6f07 upstream.
The spec allows ExitBootServices to fail with EFI\_INVALID\_PARAMETER if a
race condition has occurred where the EFI has updated the memory map after
the stub grabbed a reference to the map. The spec defines a retry
proceedure with specific requirements to handle this scenario.
This scenario was previously observed on x86 - commit d3768d885c6c ("x86,
efi: retry ExitBootServices() on failure") but the current fix is not spec
compliant and the scenario is now observed on the Qualcomm Technologies
QDF2432 via the FDT stub which does not handle the error and thus causes
boot failures. The user will notice the boot failure as the kernel is not
executed and the system may drop back to a UEFI shell, but will be
unresponsive to input and the system will require a power cycle to recover.
Add a helper to the stub library that correctly adheres to the spec in the
case of EFI\_INVALID\_PARAMETER from ExitBootServices and can be universally
used across all stub implementations.

efi/libstub: Allocate headspace in efi\_get\_memory\_map()
commit dadb57abc37499f565b23933dbf49b435c3ba8af upstream.
efi\_get\_memory\_map() allocates a buffer to store the memory map that it
retrieves. This buffer may need to be reused by the client after
ExitBootServices() is called, at which point allocations are not longer
permitted. To support this usecase, provide the allocated buffer size back
to the client, and allocate some additional headroom to account for any
reasonable growth in the map that is likely to happen between the call to
efi\_get\_memory\_map() and the client reusing the buffer.

sched/core: Fix a race between try\_to\_wake\_up() and a woken up task
commit 135e8c9250dd5c8c9aae5984fde6f230d0cbfeaf upstream.
The origin of the issue I've seen is related to
a missing memory barrier between check for task->state and
the check for task->on\_rq.
The task being woken up is already awake from a schedule()
and is doing the following:
do {
schedule()
set\_current\_state(TASK\_(UN)INTERRUPTIBLE);
} while (!cond);
The waker, actually gets stuck doing the following in
try\_to\_wake\_up():
while (p->on\_cpu)
cpu\_relax();
Analysis:
The instance I've seen involves the following race:
CPU1 CPU2
while () {
if (cond)
break;
do {
schedule();
set\_current\_state(TASK\_UN..)
} while (!cond);
wakeup\_routine()
spin\_lock\_irqsave(wait\_lock)
raw\_spin\_lock\_irqsave(wait\_lock) wake\_up\_process()
} try\_to\_wake\_up()
set\_current\_state(TASK\_RUNNING); ..
list\_del(&waiter.list);
CPU2 wakes up CPU1, but before it can get the wait\_lock and set
current state to TASK\_RUNNING the following occurs:
CPU3
wakeup\_routine()
raw\_spin\_lock\_irqsave(wait\_lock)
if (!list\_empty)
wake\_up\_process()
try\_to\_wake\_up()
raw\_spin\_lock\_irqsave(p->pi\_lock)
..
if (p->on\_rq && ttwu\_wakeup())
..
while (p->on\_cpu)
cpu\_relax()
..
CPU3 tries to wake up the task on CPU1 again since it finds
it on the wait\_queue, CPU1 is spinning on wait\_lock, but immediately
after CPU2, CPU3 got it.
CPU3 checks the state of p on CPU1, it is TASK\_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and
the task is spinning on the wait\_lock. Interestingly since p->on\_rq
is checked under pi\_lock, I've noticed that try\_to\_wake\_up() finds
p->on\_rq to be 0. This was the most confusing bit of the analysis,
but p->on\_rq is changed under runqueue lock, rq\_lock, the p->on\_rq
check is not reliable without this fix IMHO. The race is visible
(based on the analysis) only when ttwu\_queue() does a remote wakeup
via ttwu\_queue\_remote. In which case the p->on\_rq change is not
done uder the pi\_lock.
The result is that after a while the entire system locks up on
the raw\_spin\_irqlock\_save(wait\_lock) and the holder spins infintely
Reproduction of the issue:
The issue can be reproduced after a long run on my system with 80
threads and having to tweak available memory to very low and running
memory stress-ng mmapfork test. It usually takes a long time to
reproduce. I am trying to work on a test case that can reproduce
the issue faster, but thats work in progress. I am still testing the
changes on my still in a loop and the tests seem OK thus far.
Big thanks to Benjamin and Nick for helping debug this as well.
Ben helped catch the missing barrier, Nick caught every missing
bit in my theory.

Ben Hutchings pointed out that the commit isn't safe since it assumes
that the structure used by the driver is iw\_point, when in fact there's
no way to know about that.
Fortunately, the only driver in the tree that ever runs this code path
is the wilc1000 staging driver, so it doesn't really matter.
Clearly I should have investigated this better before applying, sorry.

of the range. Such an overflow would also throw a #GP in the PT event
configuration path.
Fix this by explicitly validating the result of this calculation.

commit ddfdad991e55b65c1cc4ee29502f6dceee04455a upstream.
The kernel\_ip() filter is used mostly by the DS/LBR code to look at the
branch addresses, but Intel PT also uses it to validate the address
filter offsets for kernel addresses, for which it is not sufficient:
supplying something in bits 64:48 that's not a sign extension of the lower
address bits (like 0xf00d000000000000) throws a #GP.
This patch adds address validation for the user supplied kernel filters.

perf/x86/amd: Make HW\_CACHE\_REFERENCES and HW\_CACHE\_MISSES measure L2
commit 080fe0b790ad438fc1b61621dac37c1964ce7f35 upstream.
While the Intel PMU monitors the LLC when perf enables the
HW\_CACHE\_REFERENCES and HW\_CACHE\_MISSES events, these events monitor
L1 instruction cache fetches (0x0080) and instruction cache misses
(0x0081) on the AMD PMU.
This is extremely confusing when monitoring the same workload across
Intel and AMD machines, since parameters like,
$ perf stat -e cache-references,cache-misses
measure completely different things.
Instead, make the AMD PMU measure instruction/data cache and TLB fill
requests to the L2 and instruction/data cache and TLB misses in the L2
when HW\_CACHE\_REFERENCES and HW\_CACHE\_MISSES are enabled,
respectively. That way the events measure unified caches on both
platforms.

perf/x86/intel/cqm: Check cqm/mbm enabled state in event init
commit 79d102cbfd2e9d94257fcc7c82807ef1cdf80322 upstream.
Yanqiu Zhang reported kernel panic when using mbm event
on system where CQM is detected but without mbm event
support, like with perf:
# perf stat -e 'intel\_cqm/event=3/' -a
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020

The reason is that we currently allow to init mbm event
even if mbm support is not detected. Adding checks for
both cqm and mbm events and support into cqm's event\_init.

perf/x86/intel: Fix PEBSv3 record drain
commit 8ef9b8455a2a3049efa9e46e8a6402b972a3eb41 upstream.
Alexander hit the WARN\_ON\_ONCE(!event) on his Skylake while running
the perf fuzzer.
This means the PEBSv3 record included a status bit for an inactive
event, something that \_should\_ not happen.
Move the code that filters the status bits against our known PEBS
events up a spot to guarantee we only deal with events we know about.
Further add "continue" statements to the WARN\_ON\_ONCE()s such that
we'll not die nor generate silly events in case we ever do hit them
again.

ath9k: bring back direction setting in ath9k\_{start\_stop}
commit e34f2ff40e0339f6a379e1ecf49e8f2759056453 upstream.
A regression was introduced in commit id 79d4db1214a ("ath9k: cleanup
led\_pin initial") that broken the WLAN status led on my laptop with
AR9287 after suspending and resuming.
Steps to reproduce:
\* Suspend (laptop)
\* Resume (laptop)
\* Observe that the WLAN led no longer turns ON/OFF depending on the
status and is always red
Even though for my case it only needs to be set to OUT in ath9k\_start
but for consistency bring back the IN direction setting as well.

commit ded89912156b1a47d940a0c954c43afbabd0c42c upstream.
User-space can choose to omit NL80211\_ATTR\_SSID and only provide raw

the allowed size. The driver further processes this IE copying it
into a local variable without checking the length. Hence stack can be

xhci: fix null pointer dereference in stop command timeout function
commit bcf42aa60c2832510b9be0f30c090bfd35bb172d upstream.
The stop endpoint command has its own 5 second timeout timer.
If the timeout function is triggered between USB3 and USB2 host
removal it will try to call usb\_hc\_died(xhci\_to\_hcd(xhci)->primary\_hcd)
the ->primary\_hcd will be set to NULL at USB3 hcd removal.
Fix this by first checking if the PCI host is being removed, and
also by using only xhci\_to\_hcd() as it will always return the primary
hcd.

fuse: direct-io: don't dirty ITER\_BVEC pages
commit 8fba54aebbdf1f999738121922e74bf796ad60ee upstream.
When reading from a loop device backed by a fuse file it deadlocks on
lock\_page().
This is because the page is already locked by the read() operation done on
the loop device. In this case we don't want to either lock the page or
dirty it.
So do what fs/direct-io.c does: only dirty the page for ITER\_IOVEC vectors.

arm64: spinlocks: implement smp\_mb\_\_before\_spinlock() as smp\_mb()
commit 872c63fbf9e153146b07f0cece4da0d70b283eeb upstream.
smp\_mb\_\_before\_spinlock() is intended to upgrade a spin\_lock() operation
to a full barrier, such that prior stores are ordered with respect to
loads and stores occuring inside the critical section.
Unfortunately, the core code defines the barrier as smp\_wmb(), which
is insufficient to provide the required ordering guarantees when used in
conjunction with our load-acquire-based spinlock implementation.
This patch overrides the arm64 definition of smp\_mb\_\_before\_spinlock()
to map to a full smp\_mb().

memory: omap-gpmc: allow probe of child nodes to fail
commit 23540d6e2f3193b946c4de43e3f9654fa6d23fe7 upstream.
A recent commit (inadvertently?) changed how failed probe of a gpmc
child node was handled. Instead of proceeding with setting up any other
children as before, a single error now aborts the whole process.
This change broke networking on some Overo boards due to probe failing
for an unrelated nand node. This second issue should obviously be
fixed, but let's restore the old behaviour of allowing child-node
probe to fail to avoid further similar breakage on other systems.

dm crypt: fix error with too large bios
commit 4e870e948fbabf62b78e8410f04c67703e7c816b upstream.
When dm-crypt processes writes, it allocates a new bio in
crypt\_alloc\_buffer(). The bio is allocated from a bio set and it can
have at most BIO\_MAX\_PAGES vector entries, however the incoming bio can be
larger (e.g. if it was allocated by bcache). If the incoming bio is
larger, bio\_alloc\_bioset() fails and an error is returned.
To avoid the error, we test for a too large bio in the function
crypt\_map() and use dm\_accept\_partial\_bio() to split the bio.
dm\_accept\_partial\_bio() trims the current bio to the desired size and
asks DM core to send another bio with the rest of the data.

bus: arm-ccn: Fix XP watchpoint settings bitmask
commit b928466b2169e061822daad48ecf55b005445547 upstream.
The code setting XP watchpoint comparator and mask registers should, in
order to be fully compliant with specification, zero one or more most
significant bits of each field. In both L cases it means zeroing bit 63.
The bitmask doing this was wrong, though, zeroing bit 60 instead.
Fortunately, due to a lucky coincidence, this turned out to be fairly
innocent with the existing hardware.

This patch treats MN as a special case (which it is), adding separate

# perf stat -a -e ccn/mn\_ecbarrier/
Additionally, direction in the MN pseudo-events XP watchpoint

Currently, the ports as seen from the rear number as:

which is illogical - this came about because the rev 2.0 boards have the

fixed the LED issue, and the Clearfog case numbers the lan ports
increasing from left to right.
Maintaining this illogical numbering causes confusion, with reports that
"my link isn't coming up" and "my connection negotiates 10base-Half"
both of which are due to people thinking that the port next to the SFP
is lan1.
Fix this by renumbering the ports to match people's expectations.

ARM: dts: imx6qdl: Fix SPDIF regression
commit f065e9e4addd75c21bb976bb2558648bf4f61de6 upstream.
Commit 833f2cbf7091 ("ARM: dts: imx6: change the core clock of spdif")
changed many more clocks than only the SPDIF core clock as stated in
the commit message.
The MLB clock has been added and this causes SPDIF regression as
reported by Xavi Drudis Ferran and also in this forum post:
https://forum.digikey.com/thread/34240
The MX6Q Reference Manual does not mention that MLB is a clock related
to SPDIF, so change it back to a dummy clock to restore SPDIF
functionality.
Thanks to Ambika for providing the fix at:

In commit 8ead9dd54716 ("devpts: more pty driver interface cleanups") I
made devpts\_get\_priv() just return the dentry->fs\_data directly. And
because I thought it wouldn't happen, I added a warning if you ever saw
a pts node that wasn't on devpts.
And no, that warning never triggered under any actual real use, but you
can trigger it by creating nonsensical pts nodes by hand.
So just revert the warning, and make devpts\_get\_priv() return NULL for
that case like it used to.

USB: change bInterval default to 10 ms
commit 08c5cd37480f59ea39682f4585d92269be6b1424 upstream.
Some full-speed mceusb infrared transceivers contain invalid endpoint
descriptors for their interrupt endpoints, with bInterval set to 0.
In the past they have worked out okay with the mceusb driver, because
the driver sets the bInterval field in the descriptor to 1,
overwriting whatever value may have been there before. However, this
approach was never sanctioned by the USB core, and in fact it does not
work with xHCI controllers, because they use the bInterval value that
was present when the configuration was installed.
Currently usbcore uses 32 ms as the default interval if the value in
the endpoint descriptor is invalid. It turns out that these IR
transceivers don't work properly unless the interval is set to 10 ms
or below. To work around this mceusb problem, this patch changes the
endpoint-descriptor parsing routine, making the default interval value
be 10 ms rather than 32 ms.

usb: chipidea: udc: fix NULL ptr dereference in isr\_setup\_status\_phase
commit 6f3c4fb6d05e63c9c6d8968302491c3a5457be61 upstream.
Problems with the signal integrity of the high speed USB data lines or
noise on reference ground lines can cause the i.MX6 USB controller to
violate USB specs and exhibit unexpected behavior.
It was observed that USBi\_UI interrupts were triggered first and when
isr\_setup\_status\_phase was called, ci->status was NULL, which lead to a
NULL pointer dereference kernel panic.
This patch fixes the kernel panic, emits a warning once and returns
-EPIPE to halt the device and let the host get stalled.
It also adds a comment to point people, who are experiencing this issue,
to their USB hardware design.

usb: renesas\_usbhs: fix clearing the {BRDY,BEMP}STS condition
commit 519d8bd4b5d3d82c413eac5bb42b106bb4b9ec15 upstream.
The previous driver is possible to stop the transfer wrongly.
For example:
1) An interrupt happens, but not BRDY interruption.
2) Read INTSTS0. And than state->intsts0 is not set to BRDY.
3) BRDY is set to 1 here.
4) Read BRDYSTS.
5) Clear the BRDYSTS. And then. the BRDY is cleared wrongly.
Remarks:
- The INTSTS0.BRDY is read only.
- If any bits of BRDYSTS are set to 1, the BRDY is set to 1.
- If BRDYSTS is 0, the BRDY is set to 0.
So, this patch adds condition to avoid such situation. (And about
NRDYSTS, this is not used for now. But, avoiding any side effects,
this patch doesn't touch it.)

iio: humidity: hdc100x: fix sensor data reads of temp and humidity
commit 0d9dcf852334b796bacc7020364afba3122db81e upstream.
Replace the i2c\_smbus\_read\_byte commmands used to retrieve the sensor
data with an i2c\_master\_recv command.
The smbus read byte method fails because the device does not expect a
stop condition after sending the first byte. When we issue the second
read, we are getting the first byte again. Net effect is that of the 14
bits used for the measurement, the 8 most significant bits are correct,
the lower 6 are not.
None of the smbus read protocols follow the pattern this device requires
(S Addr Rd [A] Data [A] Data NA P), hence the switch to an i2c receive
transaction.
Applicable from original introduction of this driver, but will require
backporting due to churn in the code.

iio: ad799x: Fix buffered capture for ad7991/ad7995/ad7999
commit 7d3cc21dab5313a02f2f3ca8164529b828a030d1 upstream.
The data buffer for captured mode for the ad799x driver is allocated in the
update\_scan\_mode() callback. This callback is not set in the iio\_info
struct for the ad7791/ad7995/ad7999, which means that the data buffer is
not allocated when a captured transfer is started. As a result the driver
crashes when the first sample is received. To fix this properly set the
update\_scan\_mode() callback.

commit 7175cce1c3f1d8c8840d2004f78f96a3904249b5 upstream.
Now that open delay and sample delay for each channel is configurable
via DT, the default IDLE\_TIMEOUT value is not enough as this is
calculated based on hardcoded macros. This results in driver returning
EBUSY sometimes. Fix this by increasing the timeout
value based on maximum value possible to open delay and sample delays
for each channel.

iio: adc: ti\_am335x\_adc: Protect FIFO1 from concurrent access
commit 90c43ec6997a892448f1f86180a515f59cafd8a3 upstream.
It is possible that two or more ADC channels can be simultaneously
requested for raw samples, in which case there can be race in access to
FIFO data resulting in loss of samples.
If am335x\_tsc\_se\_set\_once() is called again from tiadc\_read\_raw(), when
ADC is still acquired to sample one of the channels, the second process
might be put into uninterruptible sleep state. Fix these issues, by
protecting FIFO access and channel configurations with a mutex. Since
tiadc\_read\_raw() might take anywhere between few microseconds to few
milliseconds to finish execution (depending on averaging and delay
values supplied via DT), its better to use mutex instead of spinlock.

kvm: x86: correctly reset dest\_map->vector when restoring LAPIC state
commit b0eaf4506f5f95d15d6731d72c0ddf4a2179eefa upstream.
When userspace sends KVM\_SET\_LAPIC, KVM schedules a check between
the vCPU's IRR and ISR and the IOAPIC redirection table, in order
to re-establish the IOAPIC's dest\_map (the list of CPUs servicing
the real-time clock interrupt with the corresponding vectors).
However, \_\_rtc\_irq\_eoi\_tracking\_restore\_one was forgetting to
set dest\_map->vectors. Because of this, the IOAPIC did not process
the real-time clock interrupt EOI, ioapic->rtc\_status.pending\_eoi
got stuck at a non-zero value, and further RTC interrupts were
reported to userspace as coalesced.

kvm-arm: Unmap shadow pagetables properly
commit 293f293637b55db4f9f522a5a72514e98a541076 upstream.
On arm/arm64, we depend on the kvm\_unmap\_hva\* callbacks (via
mmu\_notifiers::invalidate\_\*) to unmap the stage2 pagetables when
the userspace buffer gets unmapped. However, when the Hypervisor
process exits without explicit unmap of the guest buffers, the only
notifier we get is kvm\_arch\_flush\_shadow\_all() (via mmu\_notifier::release
) which does nothing on arm. Later this causes us to access pages that
were already released [via exit\_mmap() -> unmap\_vmas()] when we actually
get to unmap the stage2 pagetable [via kvm\_arch\_destroy\_vm() ->
kvm\_free\_stage2\_pgd()]. This triggers crashes with CONFIG\_DEBUG\_PAGEALLOC,
which unmaps any free'd pages from the linear map.

x86/paravirt: Do not trace \_paravirt\_ident\_\*() functions
commit 15301a570754c7af60335d094dd2d1808b0641a5 upstream.
Łukasz Daniluk reported that on a RHEL kernel that his machine would lock up
after enabling function tracer. I asked him to bisect the functions within
available\_filter\_functions, which he did and it came down to three:
\_paravirt\_nop(), \_paravirt\_ident\_32() and \_paravirt\_ident\_64()
It was found that this is only an issue when noreplace-paravirt is added
to the kernel command line.
This means that those functions are most likely called within critical
sections of the funtion tracer, and must not be traced.
In newer kenels \_paravirt\_nop() is defined within gcc asm(), and is no
longer an issue. But both \_paravirt\_ident\_{32,64}() causes the
following splat when they are traced:

mm: fix cache mode of dax pmd mappings
commit 9049771f7d5490a302589976984810064c83ab40 upstream.
track\_pfn\_insert() in vmf\_insert\_pfn\_pmd() is marking dax mappings as
uncacheable rendering them impractical for application usage. DAX-pte
mappings are cached and the goal of establishing DAX-pmd mappings is to
attain more performance, not dramatically less (3 orders of magnitude).
track\_pfn\_insert() relies on a previous call to reserve\_memtype() to
establish the expected page\_cache\_mode for the range. While memremap()
arranges for reserve\_memtype() to be called, devm\_memremap\_pages() does
not. So, teach track\_pfn\_insert() and untrack\_pfn() how to handle
tracking without a vma, and arrange for devm\_memremap\_pages() to
establish the write-back-cache reservation in the memtype tree.

Fixes an oops that might happen if uverbs\_close races with

Both contexts may run ib\_uverbs\_cleanup\_ucontext, it depends
on the flow.
Currently, there is no protection for a case that remove\_one
didn't make the cleanup it runs to its end, the underlying
ib\_device was freed then uverbs\_close will call
ib\_uverbs\_cleanup\_ucontext and OOPs.
Above might happen if uverbs\_close deleted the file from the list
then remove\_one didn't find it and runs to its end.
Fixes to protect against that case by a new cleanup lock so that
ib\_uverbs\_cleanup\_ucontext will be called always before that
remove\_one is ended.

IB/hfi1,IB/qib: Fix qp\_stats sleep with rcu read lock held
commit c62fb260a86dde3df5b2905432caa0e9f6898434 upstream.
The qp init function does a kzalloc() while holding the RCU
lock that encounters the following warning with a debug kernel
when a cat of the qp\_stats is done:
[ 231.723948] rcu\_scheduler\_active = 1, debug\_locks = 0
[ 231.731939] 3 locks held by cat/11355:
[ 231.736492] #0: (debugfs\_srcu){......}, at: [] debugfs\_use\_file\_start+0x5/0x90
[ 231.746955] #1: (&p->lock){+.+.+.}, at: [] seq\_read+0x4c/0x3c0

[ 231.766862]
The init functions do an implicit next which requires the rcu read lock
before the kzalloc().
Fix for both drivers is to change the scope of the init function to only
do the allocation and the initialization of the just allocated iter.

mm, oom: prevent premature OOM killer invocation for high order request
commit 6b4e3181d7bd5ca5ab6f45929e4a5ffa7ab4ab7f upstream.
There have been several reports about pre-mature OOM killer invocation
in 4.7 kernel when order-2 allocation request (for the kernel stack)
invoked OOM killer even during basic workloads (light IO or even kernel
compile on some filesystems). In all reported cases the memory is
fragmented and there are no order-2+ pages available. There is usually
a large amount of slab memory (usually dentries/inodes) and further
debugging has shown that there are way too many unmovable blocks which
are skipped during the compaction. Multiple reporters have confirmed
that the current linux-next which includes [1] and [2] helped and OOMs
are not reproducible anymore.
A simpler fix for the late rc and stable is to simply ignore the
compaction feedback and retry as long as there is a reclaim progress and
we are not getting OOM for order-0 pages. We already do that for
CONFING\_COMPACTION=n so let's reuse the same code when compaction is
enabled as well.

kexec: fix double-free when failing to relocate the purgatory
commit 070c43eea5043e950daa423707ae3c77e2f48edb upstream.
If kexec\_apply\_relocations fails, kexec\_load\_purgatory frees pi->sechdrs
and pi->purgatory\_buf. This is redundant, because in case of error
kimage\_file\_prepare\_segments calls kimage\_file\_post\_load\_cleanup, which
will also free those buffers.
This causes two warnings like the following, one for pi->sechdrs and the
other for pi->purgatory\_buf:

pNFS: Ensure LAYOUTGET and LAYOUTRETURN are properly serialised
commit bf0291dd2267a2b9a4cd74d65249553d11bb45d6 upstream.
According to RFC5661, the client is responsible for serialising
LAYOUTGET and LAYOUTRETURN to avoid ambiguity. Consider the case
where we send both in parallel.
Client Server
====== ======
LAYOUTGET(seqid=X)
LAYOUTRETURN(seqid=X)
LAYOUTGET return seqid=X+1
LAYOUTRETURN return seqid=X+2
Process LAYOUTRETURN
Forget layout stateid
Process LAYOUTGET
Set seqid=X+1
The client processes the layoutget/layoutreturn in the wrong order,
and since the result of the layoutreturn was to clear the only
existing layout segment, the client forgets the layout stateid.
When the LAYOUTGET comes in, it is treated as having a completely
new stateid, and so the client sets the wrong sequence id...
Fix is to check if there are outstanding LAYOUTGET requests
before we send the LAYOUTRETURN (note that LAYOUGET will already
wait if it sees an outstanding LAYOUTRETURN).

nfsd: Close race between nfsd4\_release\_lockowner and nfsd4\_lock
commit 885848186fbc2d1d8fb6d2fdc2156638ae289a46 upstream.
nfsd4\_release\_lockowner finds a lock owner that has no lock state,
and drops cl\_lock. Then release\_lockowner picks up cl\_lock and
unhashes the lock owner.
During the window where cl\_lock is dropped, I don't see anything
preventing a concurrent nfsd4\_lock from finding that same lock owner
and adding lock state to it.
Move release\_lockowner() into nfsd4\_release\_lockowner and hang onto
the cl\_lock until after the lock owner's state cannot be found
again.
Found by inspection, we don't currently have a reproducer.

kernfs: don't depend on d\_find\_any\_alias() when generating notifications
commit df6a58c5c5aa8ecb1e088ecead3fa33ae70181f1 upstream.
kernfs\_notify\_workfn() sends out file modified events for the
scheduled kernfs\_nodes. Because the modifications aren't from
userland, it doesn't have the matching file struct at hand and can't
use fsnotify\_modify(). Instead, it looked up the inode and then used
d\_find\_any\_alias() to find the dentry and used fsnotify\_parent() and
fsnotify() directly to generate notifications.
The assumption was that the relevant dentries would have been pinned
if there are listeners, which isn't true as inotify doesn't pin
dentries at all and watching the parent doesn't pin the child dentries
even for dnotify. This led to, for example, inotify watchers not
getting notifications if the system is under memory pressure and the
matching dentries got reclaimed. It can also be triggered through
/proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches or a remount attempt which involves shrinking
dcache.
fsnotify\_parent() only uses the dentry to access the parent inode,
which kernfs can do easily. Update kernfs\_notify\_workfn() so that it
uses fsnotify() directly for both the parent and target inodes without
going through d\_find\_any\_alias(). While at it, supply the target file
name to fsnotify() from kernfs\_node->name.

powerpc/mm: Don't alias user region to other regions below PAGE\_OFFSET
commit f077aaf0754bcba0fffdbd925bc12f09cd1e38aa upstream.
In commit c60ac5693c47 ("powerpc: Update kernel VSID range", 2013-03-13)
we lost a check on the region number (the top four bits of the effective
address) for addresses below PAGE\_OFFSET. That commit replaced a check
that the top 18 bits were all zero with a check that bits 46 - 59 were
zero (performed for all addresses, not just user addresses).
This means that userspace can access an address like 0x1000\_0xxx\_xxxx\_xxxx
and we will insert a valid SLB entry for it. The VSID used will be the
same as if the top 4 bits were 0, but the page size will be some random
value obtained by indexing beyond the end of the mm\_ctx\_high\_slices\_psize
array in the paca. If that page size is the same as would be used for
region 0, then userspace just has an alias of the region 0 space. If the
page size is different, then no HPTE will be found for the access, and
the process will get a SIGSEGV (since hash\_page\_mm() will refuse to create
a HPTE for the bogus address).
The access beyond the end of the mm\_ctx\_high\_slices\_psize can be at most
5.5MB past the array, and so will be in RAM somewhere. Since the access
is a load performed in real mode, it won't fault or crash the kernel.
At most this bug could perhaps leak a little bit of information about
blocks of 32 bytes of memory located at offsets of i \* 512kB past the
paca->mm\_ctx\_high\_slices\_psize array, for 1 <= i <= 11.

powerpc/powernv : Drop reference added by kset\_find\_obj()
commit a9cbf0b2195b695cbeeeecaa4e2770948c212e9a upstream.
In a situation, where Linux kernel gets notified about duplicate error log
from OPAL, it is been observed that kernel fails to remove sysfs entries
(/sys/firmware/opal/elog/0xXXXXXXXX) of such error logs. This is because,
we currently search the error log/dump kobject in the kset list via
'kset\_find\_obj()' routine. Which eventually increment the reference count
by one, once it founds the kobject.
So, unless we decrement the reference count by one after it found the kobject,
we would not be able to release the kobject properly later.
This patch adds the 'kobject\_put()' which was missing earlier.

ipv6: addrconf: fix dev refcont leak when DAD failed

In general, when DAD detected IPv6 duplicate address, ifp->state

addrconf\_dad\_failure() called with ifp refcont holding but not put.
addrconf\_dad\_work() call addrconf\_dad\_stop() without extra holding
refcount. This will not cause any issue normally.
But the race between addrconf\_dad\_failure() and addrconf\_dad\_work()
may cause ifp refcount leak and netdevice can not be unregister,

af\_unix: split 'u->readlock' into two: 'iolock' and 'bindlock'
[ Upstream commit 6e1ce3c3451291142a57c4f3f6f999a29fb5b3bc ]
Right now we use the 'readlock' both for protecting some of the af\_unix
IO path and for making the bind be single-threaded.
The two are independent, but using the same lock makes for a nasty
deadlock due to ordering with regards to filesystem locking. The bind
locking would want to nest outside the VSF pathname locking, but the IO
locking wants to nest inside some of those same locks.
We tried to fix this earlier with commit c845acb324aa ("af\_unix: Fix
splice-bind deadlock") which moved the readlock inside the vfs locks,
but that caused problems with overlayfs that will then call back into
filesystem routines that take the lock in the wrong order anyway.
Splitting the locks means that we can go back to having the bind lock be
the outermost lock, and we don't have any deadlocks with lock ordering.

This reverts commit c845acb324aa85a39650a14e7696982ceea75dc1.
It turns out that it just replaces one deadlock with another one: we can
still get the wrong lock ordering with the readlock due to overlayfs
calling back into the filesystem layer and still taking the vfs locks
after the readlock.
The proper solution ends up being to just split the readlock into two
pieces: the bind lock (taken \*outside\* the vfs locks) and the IO lock
(taken \*inside\* the filesystem locks). The two locks are independent
anyway.

(a) Create bonding master

(c) Now try adding eth2 into the bond

Bonding does lots of things before checking if the device enslaved is
busy or not.
In this case when the notifier call-chain sends notifications, the
bond\_netdev\_event() assumes that the rx\_handler /rx\_handler\_data is
registered while the bond\_enslave() hasn't progressed far enough to
register rx\_handler for the new slave.
This patch adds a rx\_handler check that can be performed right at the
beginning of the enslave code to avoid getting into this situation.

syscall(SYS\_ioctl, fd, 0x89e2ul, 0x20a98000ul, 0, 0, 0);
return 0;
}
This is because on the error path, after we install
the new socket file, we call sock\_release() to clean
up the socket, which leaves the fd pointing to a freed
socket. Fix this by calling sys\_close() on that fd
directly.

net: smc91x: fix SMC accesses
[ Upstream commit 2fb04fdf30192ff1e2b5834e9b7745889ea8bbcb ]
Commit b70661c70830 ("net: smc91x: use run-time configuration on all ARM
machines") broke some ARM platforms through several mistakes. Firstly,
the access size must correspond to the following rule:
(a) at least one of 16-bit or 8-bit access size must be supported
(b) 32-bit accesses are optional, and may be enabled in addition to
the above.
Secondly, it provides no emulation of 16-bit accesses, instead blindly
making 16-bit accesses even when the platform specifies that only 8-bit
is supported.
Reorganise smc91x.h so we can make use of the existing 16-bit access
emulation already provided - if 16-bit accesses are supported, use
16-bit accesses directly, otherwise if 8-bit accesses are supported,
use the provided 16-bit access emulation. If neither, BUG(). This
exactly reflects the driver behaviour prior to the commit being fixed.
Since the conversion incorrectly cut down the available access sizes on
several platforms, we also need to go through every platform and fix up
the overly-restrictive access size: Arnd assumed that if a platform can
perform 32-bit, 16-bit and 8-bit accesses, then only a 32-bit access
size needed to be specified - not so, all available access sizes must
be specified.
This likely fixes some performance regressions in doing this: if a
platform does not support 8-bit accesses, 8-bit accesses have been
emulated by performing a 16-bit read-modify-write access.
Tested on the Intel Assabet/Neponset platform, which supports only 8-bit
accesses, which was broken by the original commit.

tun: fix transmit timestamp support
[ Upstream commit 7b996243fab46092fb3a29c773c54be8152366e4 ]
Instead of using sock\_tx\_timestamp, use skb\_tx\_timestamp to record
software transmit timestamp of a packet.
sock\_tx\_timestamp resets and overrides the tx\_flags of the skb.
The function is intended to be called from within the protocol
layer when creating the skb, not from a device driver. This is
inconsistent with other drivers and will cause issues for TCP.
In TCP, we intend to sample the timestamps for the last byte
for each sendmsg/sendpage. For that reason, tcp\_sendmsg calls
tcp\_tx\_timestamp only with the last skb that it generates.
For example, if a 128KB message is split into two 64KB packets
we want to sample the SND timestamp of the last packet. The current
code in the tun driver, however, will result in sampling the SND
timestamp for both packets.
Also, when the last packet is split into smaller packets for
retranmission (see tcp\_fragment), the tun driver will record
timestamps for all of the retransmitted packets and not only the
last packet.

net/mlx5: Added missing check of msg length in verifying its signature
[ Upstream commit 2c0f8ce1b584a4d7b8ff53140d21dfed99834940 ]
Set and verify signature calculates the signature for each of the
mailbox nodes, even for those that are unused (from cache). Added
a missing length check to set and verify only those which are used.
While here, also moved the setting of msg's nodes token to where we
already go over them. This saves a pass because checksum is disabled,
and the only useful thing remaining that set signature does is setting
the token.

tcp: fix use after free in tcp\_xmit\_retransmit\_queue()
[ Upstream commit bb1fceca22492109be12640d49f5ea5a544c6bb4 ]
When tcp\_sendmsg() allocates a fresh and empty skb, it puts it at the
tail of the write queue using tcp\_add\_write\_queue\_tail()
Then it attempts to copy user data into this fresh skb.
If the copy fails, we undo the work and remove the fresh skb.
Unfortunately, this undo lacks the change done to tp->highest\_sack and
we can leave a dangling pointer (to a freed skb)
Later, tcp\_xmit\_retransmit\_queue() can dereference this pointer and
access freed memory. For regular kernels where memory is not unmapped,
this might cause SACK bugs because tcp\_highest\_sack\_seq() is buggy,
returning garbage instead of tp->snd\_nxt, but with various debug
features like CONFIG\_DEBUG\_PAGEALLOC, this can crash the kernel.
This bug was found by Marco Grassi thanks to syzkaller.

net: ipv6: Do not keep IPv6 addresses when IPv6 is disabled
[ Upstream commit bc561632dddd5af0c4444d919f01cbf6d553aa0a ]
If IPv6 is disabled when the option is set to keep IPv6
addresses on link down, userspace is unaware of this as
there is no such indication via netlink. The solution is to
remove the IPv6 addresses in this case, which results in
netlink messages indicating removal of addresses in the
usual manner. This fix also makes the behavior consistent
with the case of having IPv6 disabled first, which stops
IPv6 addresses from being added.

net/sctp: always initialise sctp\_ht\_iter::start\_fail
[ Upstream commit 54236ab09e9696a27baaae693c288920a26e8588 ]
sctp\_transport\_seq\_start() does not currently clear iter->start\_fail on
success, but relies on it being zero when it is allocated (by
seq\_open\_net()).
This can be a problem in the following sequence:
open() // allocates iter (and implicitly sets iter->start\_fail = 0)
read()
- iter->start() // fails and sets iter->start\_fail = 1
- iter->stop() // doesn't call sctp\_transport\_walk\_stop() (correct)
read() again
- iter->start() // succeeds, but doesn't change iter->start\_fail
- iter->stop() // doesn't call sctp\_transport\_walk\_stop() (wrong)
We should initialize sctp\_ht\_iter::start\_fail to zero if ->start()
succeeds, otherwise it's possible that we leave an old value of 1 there,
which will cause ->stop() to not call sctp\_transport\_walk\_stop(), which
causes all sorts of problems like not calling rcu\_read\_unlock() (and
preempt\_enable()), eventually leading to more warnings like this:

bpf: fix write helpers with regards to non-linear parts
[ Upstream commit 0ed661d5a48fa6df0b50ae64d27fe759a3ce42cf ]
Fix the bpf\_try\_make\_writable() helper and all call sites we have in BPF,
it's currently defect with regards to skbs when the write\_len spans into
non-linear parts, no matter if cloned or not.
There are multiple issues at once. First, using skb\_store\_bits() is not
correct since even if we have a cloned skb, page frags can still be shared.
To really make them private, we need to pull them in via \_\_pskb\_pull\_tail()
first, which also gets us a private head via pskb\_expand\_head() implicitly.
This is for helpers like bpf\_skb\_store\_bytes(), bpf\_l3\_csum\_replace(),
bpf\_l4\_csum\_replace(). Really, the only thing reasonable and working here
is to call skb\_ensure\_writable() before any write operation. Meaning, via
pskb\_may\_pull() it makes sure that parts we want to access are pulled in and
if not does so plus unclones the skb implicitly. If our write\_len still fits
the headlen and we're cloned and our header of the clone is not writable,
then we need to make a private copy via pskb\_expand\_head(). skb\_store\_bits()
is a bit misleading and only safe to store into non-linear data in different
contexts such as 357b40a18b04 ("[IPV6]: IPV6\_CHECKSUM socket option can
corrupt kernel memory").
For above BPF helper functions, it means after fixed bpf\_try\_make\_writable(),
we've pulled in enough, so that we operate always based on skb->data. Thus,
the call to skb\_header\_pointer() and skb\_store\_bits() becomes superfluous.
In bpf\_skb\_store\_bytes(), the len check is unnecessary too since it can
only pass in maximum of BPF stack size, so adding offset is guaranteed to
never overflow. Also bpf\_l3/4\_csum\_replace() helpers must test for proper
offset alignment since they use \_\_sum16 pointer for writing resulting csum.
The remaining helpers that change skb data not discussed here yet are
bpf\_skb\_vlan\_push(), bpf\_skb\_vlan\_pop() and bpf\_skb\_change\_proto(). The
vlan helpers internally call either skb\_ensure\_writable() (pop case) and
skb\_cow\_head() (push case, for head expansion), respectively. Similarly,
bpf\_skb\_proto\_xlat() takes care to not mangle page frags.

vti: flush x-netns xfrm cache when vti interface is removed
[ Upstream commit a5d0dc810abf3d6b241777467ee1d6efb02575fc ]
When executing the script included below, the netns delete operation
hangs with the following message (repeated at 10 second intervals):
kernel:unregister\_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 1
This occurs because a reference to the lo interface in the "secure" netns
is still held by a dst entry in the xfrm bundle cache in the init netns.
Address this problem by garbage collecting the tunnel netns flow cache
when a cross-namespace vti interface receives a NETDEV\_DOWN notification.
A more detailed description of the problem scenario (referencing commands
in the script below):
(1) ip link add vti\_test type vti local 1.1.1.1 remote 1.1.1.2 key 1
The vti\_test interface is created in the init namespace. vti\_tunnel\_init()
attaches a struct ip\_tunnel to the vti interface's netdev\_priv(dev),
setting the tunnel net to &init\_net.
(2) ip link set vti\_test netns secure
The vti\_test interface is moved to the "secure" netns. Note that
the associated struct ip\_tunnel still has tunnel->net set to &init\_net.
(3) ip netns exec secure ping -c 4 -i 0.02 -I 192.168.100.1 192.168.200.1
The first packet sent using the vti device causes xfrm\_lookup() to be
called as follows:
dst = xfrm\_lookup(tunnel->net, skb\_dst(skb), fl, NULL, 0);
Note that tunnel->net is the init namespace, while skb\_dst(skb) references
the vti\_test interface in the "secure" namespace. The returned dst
references an interface in the init namespace.
Also note that the first parameter to xfrm\_lookup() determines which flow
cache is used to store the computed xfrm bundle, so after xfrm\_lookup()
returns there will be a cached bundle in the init namespace flow cache
with a dst referencing a device in the "secure" namespace.
(4) ip netns del secure
Kernel begins to delete the "secure" namespace. At some point the
vti\_test interface is deleted, at which point dst\_ifdown() changes
the dst->dev in the cached xfrm bundle flow from vti\_test to lo (still
in the "secure" namespace however).
Since nothing has happened to cause the init namespace's flow cache
to be garbage collected, this dst remains attached to the flow cache,
so the kernel loops waiting for the last reference to lo to go away.

bpf: fix method of PTR\_TO\_PACKET reg id generation
[ Upstream commit 1f415a74b0ca64b5bfacbb12d71ed2ec050a8cfb ]
Using per-register incrementing ID can lead to
find\_good\_pkt\_pointers() confusing registers which
have completely different values. Consider example:
0: (bf) r6 = r1
1: (61) r8 = \*(u32 \*)(r6 +76)
2: (61) r0 = \*(u32 \*)(r6 +80)
3: (bf) r7 = r8
4: (07) r8 += 32
5: (2d) if r8 > r0 goto pc+9
R0=pkt\_end R1=ctx R6=ctx R7=pkt(id=0,off=0,r=32) R8=pkt(id=0,off=32,r=32) R10=fp
6: (bf) r8 = r7
7: (bf) r9 = r7
8: (71) r1 = \*(u8 \*)(r7 +0)
9: (0f) r8 += r1
10: (71) r1 = \*(u8 \*)(r7 +1)
11: (0f) r9 += r1
12: (07) r8 += 32
13: (2d) if r8 > r0 goto pc+1
R0=pkt\_end R1=inv56 R6=ctx R7=pkt(id=0,off=0,r=32) R8=pkt(id=1,off=32,r=32) R9=pkt(id=1,off=0,r=32) R10=fp
14: (71) r1 = \*(u8 \*)(r9 +16)
15: (b7) r7 = 0
16: (bf) r0 = r7
17: (95) exit
We need to get a UNKNOWN\_VALUE with imm to force id
generation so lines 0-5 make r7 a valid packet pointer.
We then read two different bytes from the packet and
add them to copies of the constructed packet pointer.
r8 (line 9) and r9 (line 11) will get the same id of 1,
independently. When either of them is validated (line
13) - find\_good\_pkt\_pointers() will also mark the other
as safe. This leads to access on line 14 being mistakenly
considered safe.

drm/msm: protect against faults from copy\_from\_user() in submit ioctl
commit d78d383ab354b0b9e1d23404ae0d9fbdeb9aa035 upstream.
An evil userspace could try to cause deadlock by passing an unfaulted-in
GEM bo as submit->bos (or submit->cmds) table. Which will trigger
msm\_gem\_fault() while we already hold struct\_mutex. See:

fscrypto: require write access to mount to set encryption policy
commit ba63f23d69a3a10e7e527a02702023da68ef8a6d upstream.
Since setting an encryption policy requires writing metadata to the
filesystem, it should be guarded by mnt\_want\_write/mnt\_drop\_write.
Otherwise, a user could cause a write to a frozen or readonly
filesystem. This was handled correctly by f2fs but not by ext4. Make
fscrypt\_process\_policy() handle it rather than relying on the filesystem
to get it right.

MIPS: KVM: Check for pfn noslot case
commit ba913e4f72fc9cfd03dad968dfb110eb49211d80 upstream.
When mapping a page into the guest we error check using is\_error\_pfn(),
however this doesn't detect a value of KVM\_PFN\_NOSLOT, indicating an
error HVA for the page. This can only happen on MIPS right now due to
unusual memslot management (e.g. being moved / removed / resized), or
with an Enhanced Virtual Memory (EVA) configuration where the default
KVM\_HVA\_ERR\_\* and kvm\_is\_error\_hva() definitions are unsuitable (fixed
in a later patch). This case will be treated as a pfn of zero, mapping
the first page of physical memory into the guest.
It would appear the MIPS KVM port wasn't updated prior to being merged
(in v3.10) to take commit 81c52c56e2b4 ("KVM: do not treat noslot pfn as
a error pfn") into account (merged v3.8), which converted a bunch of
is\_error\_pfn() calls to is\_error\_noslot\_pfn(). Switch to using
is\_error\_noslot\_pfn() instead to catch this case properly.

clocksource/drivers/sun4i: Clear interrupts after stopping timer in probe function
commit b53e7d000d9e6e9fd2c6eb6b82d2783c67fd599e upstream.
The bootloader (U-boot) sometimes uses this timer for various delays.
It uses it as a ongoing counter, and does comparisons on the current
counter value. The timer counter is never stopped.
In some cases when the user interacts with the bootloader, or lets
it idle for some time before loading Linux, the timer may expire,
and an interrupt will be pending. This results in an unexpected
interrupt when the timer interrupt is enabled by the kernel, at
which point the event\_handler isn't set yet. This results in a NULL
pointer dereference exception, panic, and no way to reboot.
Clear any pending interrupts after we stop the timer in the probe
function to avoid this.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1384403#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-13 08:56:50 UTC  ``` A stack based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap() function. User-space can choose to omit NL80211_ATTR_SSID and only provide raw IE TLV data. When doing so it can provide SSID IE with length exceeding the allowed size. The driver further processes this IE copying it into a local variable without checking the length. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.

# USN-3146-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

30 November 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

It was discovered that the \_\_get\_user\_asm\_ex implementation in the Linux

kernel for x86/x86\_64 contained extended asm statements that were

incompatible with the exception table. A local attacker could use this to

gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-9644](/security/CVE-2016-9644))

Andreas Gruenbacher and Jan Kara discovered that the filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel did not clear the setgid bit during a

setxattr call. A local attacker could use this to possibly elevate group

privileges. ([CVE-2016-7097](/security/CVE-2016-7097))

Marco Grassi discovered that the driver for Areca RAID Controllers in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate control messages. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

privileges. ([CVE-2016-7425](/security/CVE-2016-7425))

Daxing Guo discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the Broadcom

IEEE802.11n FullMAC driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

privileges. ([CVE-2016-8658](/security/CVE-2016-8658))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

  [4.4.0-51.72](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-51.72)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3145-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

30 November 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Marco Grassi discovered that the driver for Areca RAID Controllers in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate control messages. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

privileges. ([CVE-2016-7425](/security/CVE-2016-7425))

Daxing Guo discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the Broadcom

IEEE802.11n FullMAC driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

privileges. ([CVE-2016-8658](/security/CVE-2016-8658))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
