Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap` function of the Broadcom `brcmfmac` WiFi driver.
*   The driver parses data received via the `NL80211_CMD_START_AP` or `NL80211_CMD_NEW_BEACON` netlink commands. If the `NL80211_ATTR_SSID` attribute is omitted, the driver parses the beacon head data, looking for the SSID information element (WLAN_EID_SSID).
*   The `brcmf_parse_tlvs` function extracts the SSID IE, and its length is not validated against the destination buffer, which is fixed size (32 bytes).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a classic stack buffer overflow. The driver copies user-provided data (`ssid_ie->data`) into a fixed-size stack buffer (`ssid_le.SSID`) using `memcpy` without prior size validation.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver doesn't properly check the length of the SSID information element before copying it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (System Crash):**  The most likely immediate impact is a system crash due to the stack corruption.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Although considered unlikely by the reporter, the possibility of arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation cannot be completely ruled out.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Netlink Socket:** The attack vector is through the `nl80211` netlink socket, which is used for Wi-Fi configuration.
*  **Crafted Netlink Command:** An attacker needs to send a specially crafted `NL80211_CMD_START_AP` or `NL80211_CMD_NEW_BEACON` command which omits the `NL80211_ATTR_SSID` attribute but includes a `WLAN_EID_SSID` information element with a length exceeding 32 bytes within the beacon head data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*  **CAP_NET_ADMIN Capability:** The attacker needs the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability to send the required netlink commands, typically requiring root or a similar privileged user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the Broadcom FullMAC IEEE 802.11n driver, `brcmfmac`.
*   The vulnerability was present in Linux kernel versions before 4.7.5.
*   Patches were released to address this vulnerability, including the one at <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/?id=ded89912156b1a47d940a0c954c43afbabd0c42c>
*   The fix adds a length check `ssid_ie->len > IEEE80211_MAX_SSID_LEN` before the memcpy to protect against the overflow.
*   Ubuntu security notices USN-3146-1 and USN-3145-1 addressed this vulnerability in their respective releases.
