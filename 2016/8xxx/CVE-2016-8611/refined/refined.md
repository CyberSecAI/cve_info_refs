Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-8611:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of enforced limits within the OpenStack Glance image service when processing POST requests to the `/images` API endpoint (both v1 and v2). This means authenticated users can create an unlimited number of image records.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Rate Limiting:** The core issue is the absence of rate limiting or resource quotas on the number of image creation requests a single tenant can make.
*   **Database Saturation:**  The lack of limits allows users to create numerous image records, which are stored in various database tables (images, image\_properties, image\_tags, image\_members). This can lead to the database tables being filled with useless records.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. By filling the database with excessive image records, the transaction response times slow down significantly, making the Glance service unresponsive and potentially disrupting the entire OpenStack cloud environment. This impacts the availability of the service for all users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Abuse:** Attackers exploit the `/images` API POST method in Glance v1 and v2 by creating numerous image records.
*   **Authenticated Users:** This attack vector requires the attacker to have valid authentication credentials within the OpenStack environment to access the Glance API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to authenticate with the OpenStack environment and access the Glance API.
*   **Basic API knowledge:** The attacker must be familiar with the Glance API and how to send POST requests to create images.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Glance image service.
*   The created image records are in `queued` status, which means they don't necessarily consume storage but still impact database performance.
*   Mitigation strategies include implementing rate limiting using external proxies (Repose, NGINX, HAProxy, Apache) or restricting image creation to admin roles (though this may have side effects).
*   Monitoring the Glance database for unusual growth is also advised.
