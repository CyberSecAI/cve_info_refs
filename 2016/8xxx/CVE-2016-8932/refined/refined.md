- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the file upload functionality of IBM Kenexa LMS on Cloud.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could upload malicious files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server, complete compromise of the system with confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted request to upload an arbitrary file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user (low-privileged user) with the ability to interact with the file upload feature of the application.
