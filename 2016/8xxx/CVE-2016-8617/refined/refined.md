{
  "CVE-2016-8617": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the base64 encoding function within libcurl. On 32-bit systems, multiplying the input size by 4/3 can result in a wrapped-around value due to integer overflow, which then leads to an undersized buffer being allocated. Consequently, when the full encoded data is written into this undersized buffer, it results in an out-of-bounds write, overwriting adjacent memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds Write",
      "Improper buffer size calculation"
     ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause a heap-based buffer overflow by providing a large username, resulting in memory corruption which can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a large username directly via `CURLOPT_USERNAME` or the `-u, --user` option in curl command-line tool.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to set the username to an extremely large size (at least 1GB of data on a 32-bit system) through a curl request or by using the command-line tool.",
     "Additional details": "64bit systems are not vulnerable because the `size_t` type is big enough, so integer overflow can't happen. Affects Red Hat JBoss Core Services and  Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux."
