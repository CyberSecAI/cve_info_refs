- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow occurs due to an improperly sized memcpy operation within the `Doc_SetSummary` function. The size parameter of `memcpy` is derived from a field within the DOC file's Document Properties (`Dop`) structure and can be controlled by a malicious actor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow due to unchecked size parameter in a memcpy operation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution due to heap corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted DOC file to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious DOC file to the application which uses the vulnerable library. This usually involves a user opening the crafted file within an application utilizing the vulnerable component.
