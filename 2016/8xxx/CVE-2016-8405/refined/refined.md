{
  "CVE-2016-8405": {
    "Description": "The frame buffer video subsystem does not properly check bounds while copying color maps to userspace, causing a heap buffer out-of-bounds read, leading to information disclosure.",
    "Root cause": "Improper bounds checking in the framebuffer video subsystem when copying color maps to userspace.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local malicious application that can trigger the framebuffer color map copy operation."
    }
