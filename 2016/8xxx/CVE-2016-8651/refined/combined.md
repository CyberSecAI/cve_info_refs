| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c0)  Josep 'Pep' Turro Mauri    2016-11-24 18:40:40 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  An OpenShift node suffered from OOM that killed the node process. This resulted in persistent volumes that were in use at that time by pods running on that node to be wiped.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  atomic-openshift-3.3.1.5-1.git.0.62700af.el7  How reproducible: Observed at least twice on two separate AWS-based clusters.  Steps to Reproduce:  1. deploy atomic-openshift-3.3.1.5-1.git.0.62700af.el7.x86_64 on some AWS nodes (two used for reproduction)  2. create a PVC + PV (using e.g. alpha provisioning): $ oc create -f - <<EOF kind: PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion: v1 metadata:   name: myclaim   annotations:     "volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class": "fast"     "volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class": "fast" spec:   accessModes:     - ReadWriteOnce   resources:     requests:       storage: 1500Mi EOF  3. create a pod that writes to the volume:  $ oc create -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata:   name: testpod   labels:      name: test spec:    restartPolicy: Never   containers:      - resources:         limits :           cpu: 0.5       image: gcr.io/google_containers/busybox       command:         - "/bin/sh"         - "-c"         - "while true; do date; date >>/mnt/test/date; sleep 1; done"       name: busybox       volumeMounts:         - name: vol           mountPath: /mnt/test   volumes:       - name: vol         persistentVolumeClaim:           claimName: myclaim EOF   Now the magic:  4. find out on which node the pod runs, e.g. $ oc describe pod testpod ... "Successfully assigned testpod to ip-172-18-8-57.ec2.internal"  5. on the node, look where the volume is mounted and check that "date" is there: $ mount  ... /dev/xvdba on /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/plugins/kubernetes.io/aws-ebs/mounts/aws/us-east-1d/vol-1c6cc08d type ext4 ... $ ls /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/plugins/kubernetes.io/aws-ebs/mounts/aws/us-east-1d/vol-1c6cc08d date   6. on the node: $ service atomic-openshift-node stop  6. on the master, delete the pod $ oc delete pod testpod  7. on the node: $ service atomic-openshift-node start  8. wait for a minute or so...  9. on the node, check that the volume is still mounted *and* the directory where it is mounted is empty:  $ mount  ... /dev/xvdba on /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/plugins/kubernetes.io/aws-ebs/mounts/aws/us-east-1d/vol-1c6cc08d type ext4 ...  $ ls /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/plugins/kubernetes.io/aws-ebs/mounts/aws/us-east-1d/vol-1c6cc08d   Actual results: -> something removed file date from the volume!  Expected results: -> data still there   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c1)  Jan Safranek    2016-11-24 18:46:07 UTC  ``` We need to backport <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/27970> and <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36840> into 3.3   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c4)  hchen    2016-11-28 18:59:27 UTC  ``` I am wondering if there is a chance the data file still lived on the volume but the volume was detached after step 9. Can you get mount output? If the EBS volume is detached, can you re-attach it and check if the file is still there?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c5)  Jianwei Hou    2016-11-29 07:37:46 UTC  ``` I tried to reproduce this on GCE following the above steps. After step 8, pod was deleted, when you run "mount", the directories were still there but were no longer accessible.  ``` -bash-4.2# mount|grep pvc-5f41ae8d-b5f9-11e6-8bac-42010af00013 /dev/sdc on /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/plugins/kubernetes.io/gce-pd/mounts/kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-5f41ae8d-b5f9-11e6-8bac-42010af00013  type ext4 (rw,relatime,seclabel,data=ordered) /dev/sdc on /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/pods/6c21aa22-b5f9-11e6-8bac-42010af00013/volumes/kubernetes.io~gce-pd/pvc-5f41ae8d-b5f9-11e6-8 bac-42010af00013 type ext4 (rw,relatime,seclabel,data=ordered)  -bash-4.2# ls /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/pods/6c21aa22-b5f9-11e6-8bac-42010af00013/volumes/kubernetes.io~gce-pd/pvc-5f41ae8d-b5f9-11e6 -8bac-42010af00013/ ls: reading directory /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/pods/6c21aa22-b5f9-11e6-8bac-42010af00013/volumes/kubernetes.io~gce-pd/pvc-5f41ae8d-b 5f9-11e6-8bac-42010af00013/: Input/output error ```  From gce console, I looked up for the volume and found the volume was 'available'. Since PV and PVC were still there, I recreated the pod again to use the volume. The data in the volume were **NOT** wiped.  So in the description, after step 9, the system was left with an unclean mount, the volume was already detached from the node.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c7)  Jianwei Hou    2016-11-29 11:00:18 UTC  ``` Reproduced it on aws with 'openshift v3.3.1.5'.  Yes the volume was still attached and mounted, the data in it were lost.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c11)  Hemant Kumar    2016-11-29 20:47:35 UTC  ``` Just wanted to reiterate what hchen posted. I started a cluster with openshift (v3.3.1.5) on AWS using Flexy launch and created a pvc with following yaml:  apiVersion: v1 metadata:   name: dyn-claim   annotations:     volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "bar"  spec:   accessModes:     - ReadWriteOnce   resources:     requests:       storage: 1Gi   and the pod looked like: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata:   name: testpod   labels:     name: test spec:   restartPolicy: Never   containers:     - resources:         limits :           cpu: 0.5       image: gcr.io/google_containers/busybox       command:         - "/bin/sh"         - "-c"         - "while true; do date; date >>/mnt/test/date; sleep 1; done"       name: busybox       volumeMounts:         - name: vol           mountPath: /mnt/test   volumes:       - name: vol         persistentVolumeClaim:           claimName: dyn-claim  And I first created the pv/pvc. Started the pod.  After that I stopped atomic-openshift-node service on node where pod was scheduled and then deleted the pod (Pod deletion was stuck in Terminating state).  After waiting a while, I started back atomic-openshift-node service and volume mount was gone from the node. I checked the volume by mounting it in another pod  but data was still there.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c13)  Eric Paris    2016-11-29 23:14:39 UTC  ``` The key to reproducing under 3.3.1.5 is to make sure the node comes up with ```   enable-controller-attach-detach:   - 'false' ```  Which would be true for upgraded clusters, but would not be the default for new clusters...   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c14)  Eric Paris    2016-11-29 23:18:43 UTC  ``` Also should point out (not surprising given the attach controller thing) this does not reproduce if you use a hostDir PV.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c15)  Jan Safranek    2016-11-30 13:41:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to Eric Paris from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c13)) > The key to reproducing under 3.3.1.5 is to make sure the node comes up with > >   enable-controller-attach-detach: >   - 'false'   I can reproduce it with enable-controller-attach-detach: true, the key is probably to wait a lot before starting the node again, i.e. between steps 6 and 7. The pod should disappear from API server, "Terminating" is not enough.  "oc delete pod testpod  --grace-period=0" speeds things up.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1398417#c21)  Bradley Childs    2016-12-01 01:47:40 UTC  ``` Fix merged into OSE 3.3:  <https://github.com/openshift/ose/pull/480>  The 3.3 branch of Origin has test failures, so we haven't merged there yet (but there is a PR here: <https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/12024>).

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Important: atomic-openshift security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2915)

## Topic

An update for atomic-openshift is now available for Red Hat OpenShift
Container Platform 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability
from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is the company's cloud computing
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private
cloud deployments.

This advisory contains the RPM packages for Red Hat OpenShift Container
Platform releases 3.3.1.7, 3.2.1.21, and 3.1.1.10. See the following
advisory for the container images for these releases:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2016:2916](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2016%3A2916)

Security Fix(es):

* An input validation flaw was found in the way OpenShift handles requests

for images. A user, with a copy of the manifest associated with an image,
can pull an image even if they do not have access to the image normally,
resulting in the disclosure of any information contained within the image.
(CVE-2016-8651)

Bug Fix(es) for OpenShift Container Platform 3.3:

* Previously when rapidly updating multiple namespaces

controlled by a single ClusterResourceQuota, the status.total.used can get
out of sync with the sum of the status.namespaces[\*].used. This bug fix
ensures the ClusterResourceQuota objects are properly updated. (BZ#1400200)

* When using the `oc new-app --search` command in an environment where

OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) could not reach Docker Hub, the command
failed for any query. OCP now prints a warning and continues with what was
found in other sources. (BZ#1388524)

* The OpenShift Container Platform node daemon did not recover properly

from restarts, and it lost information about attached and mounted volumes.
In rare cases, the daemon deleted all data on a mounted volume, thinking
that it has been already unmounted while it was only missing its node's
cache. This bug fix ensures node caches are recovered after restarts, and
as a result no data loss occurs on the mounted volumes. (BZ#1398417)

* Previously, ScheduledJobs were not cleaned up on project deletion. If a

new project was created with the same project name, the previously-defined
ScheduledJobs would re-appear. This bug fix ensures ScheduledJobs are
removed when a project is removed. (BZ#1399700)

Bug Fix(es) for OpenShift Container Platform 3.2:

* When using the `oc new-app --search` command in an environment where

OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) could not reach Docker Hub, the command
failed for any query. OCP now prints a warning and continues with what was
found in other sources. (BZ#1388522)

All OpenShift Container Platform users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages and images.
