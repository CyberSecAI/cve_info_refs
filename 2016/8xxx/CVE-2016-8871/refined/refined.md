{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A side channel in OAEP decoding could be used to distinguish RSA ciphertexts that did or did not have a leading 0 byte.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Timing side channel vulnerability in OAEP decoding implementation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker capable of precisely measuring the time taken for OAEP decoding could use this as an oracle allowing decryption of arbitrary RSA ciphertexts.",
  "Attack vectors": "Precise timing measurements of OAEP decoding operations. Local attacks such as cache or branch predictor based side-channel attacks are considered feasible.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to precisely measure the time taken for OAEP decoding. Local access is likely required, possibly via cache or branch predictor side-channel attacks. Remote exploitation is considered difficult due to the longer and variable time taken by RSA decryption."
