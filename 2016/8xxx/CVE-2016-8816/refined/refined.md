- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape`. A value passed from user space is used without validation as an index to an array.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation. Specifically, a user-supplied value used as an array index is not checked for validity.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to denial of service (crashes) or potential escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to execute code on the local machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access with low privileges and needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable driver component.
