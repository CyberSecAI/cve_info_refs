Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-8701:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `bm_readbody_bmp` function within the `bitmap_io.c` file of the potrace library. This occurs when parsing a crafted BMP image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is specifically a heap-based buffer overflow, meaning that a buffer allocated on the heap is overwritten. This is a memory corruption issue.
*   **Insecure BMP Parsing:** The `bm_readbody_bmp` function is vulnerable when parsing specifically crafted BMP images, indicating a lack of proper bounds checking or input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the application, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer error reports.
*  **Code Execution**: A heap-based buffer overflow can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution in the context of the application, although this is not explicitly confirmed in provided texts, such is the nature of this kind of vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted BMP Image:** The attack vector is a crafted BMP image file. The attacker provides a malicious image as input to the potrace application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input to Potrace**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted BMP file as input to the potrace application or service which uses the vulnerable `bm_readbody_bmp` function.
*   **No prior privileges:** No specific privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, it is triggered by the parsing of the malicious input.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
*   The specific location of the overflow is at `bitmap_io.c:690:4` within the `bm_readbody_bmp` function.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in potrace version 1.13.
*   This is one of several related vulnerabilities discovered by the same researcher in potrace, all related to parsing crafted BMP images.

**Summary**

CVE-2016-8701 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in potrace's `bm_readbody_bmp` function that can be triggered by processing a crafted BMP image, leading to a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution.
