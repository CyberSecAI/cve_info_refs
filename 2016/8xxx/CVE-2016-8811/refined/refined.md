  "CVE-2016-8811": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) within the DxgkDdiEscape handler for ID 0x7000170. It occurs because the driver does not validate the size of an input buffer provided by the user.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of input buffer size validation in the DxgkDdiEscape handler for ID 0x7000170.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation can lead to denial of service or potential escalation of privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access. A user can pass a crafted input buffer to the driver.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to interact with the graphics driver. This typically means having local access to the system."
