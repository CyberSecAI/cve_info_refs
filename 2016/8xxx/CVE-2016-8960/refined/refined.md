- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the IBM Cognos Business Intelligence software allowing a lower-privilege user to adopt the capabilities of a higher-privilege user by intercepting and reusing the higher-privilege user's cookie value from an HTTP request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege Escalation vulnerability due to insecure handling of user capabilities and session cookies.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A lower-privileged user can gain unauthorized access to resources and functionalities they should not have access to, potentially allowing them to perform actions they are not authorized to do.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to intercept the HTTP request of a higher-privilege user to obtain the cookie and then use the obtained cookie in subsequent requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to intercept HTTP requests, which likely means they need to be on the same network or have some form of network access to the target. No specific user privileges are explicitly mentioned as necessary for the attack, implying any user with the ability to intercept network traffic could potentially perform the attack.
