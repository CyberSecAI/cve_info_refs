- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web application of Moxa AWK-3131A allows unauthenticated access to the `/asqc.asp` URL, which discloses sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure due to lack of authentication for a specific URL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve sensitive information by accessing the vulnerable URL, potentially leading to further attacks or unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack by sending a request to the `/asqc.asp` URL of the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the targeted device to send the crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint. No prior authentication is needed.
