The provided content is related to CVE-2016-8713.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write during PDF parsing within the `npdf.dll` library of Nitro Pro 10.5.9.9. Specifically, a crafted PDF can cause the program to use a value from uninitialized heap memory to calculate a memory address for a write operation, resulting in a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write / memory corruption: The vulnerability involves writing to a memory address outside the allocated buffer.
- Improper handling of heap memory: The program reads a value from memory that has been deallocated or is otherwise invalid.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: The crafted PDF can corrupt memory, potentially leading to code execution.
- Denial of service: The memory corruption leads to a crash and termination of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF file.
- The attacker needs to send the malicious PDF to the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to deliver the crafted PDF file to the victim.
- No special privileges are required on the victim's system to trigger the vulnerability other than being able to open a PDF file using the vulnerable software.
