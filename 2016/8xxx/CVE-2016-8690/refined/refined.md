  "additional_information": [
    "The vulnerability is located in the `bmp_getdata` function within `bmp_dec.c`.",
        "The patch for this vulnerability involved adding checks to ensure data structures are initialized before use in `jas_matrix_create` to prevent negative number of rows and columns.",
        "The fix also includes changes to prevent dereferencing of null pointers when reading BMP data",
    "The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).",
