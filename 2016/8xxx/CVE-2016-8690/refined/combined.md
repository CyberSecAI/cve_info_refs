Package        : jasper
Version        : 1.900.1-debian1-2.4+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5203 CVE-2015-5221 CVE-2016-8690
                 CVE-2017-13748 CVE-2017-14132

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in the JasPer
JPEG-2000 library.

CVE-2015-5203

    Gustavo Grieco discovered an integer overflow vulnerability that
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or may have
    other unspecified impact via a crafted JPEG 2000 image file.

CVE-2015-5221

    Josselin Feist found a double-free vulnerability that allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application crash) by
    processing a malformed image file.

CVE-2016-8690

    Gustavo Grieco discovered a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability
    that can cause a denial-of-service via a crafted BMP image file. The
    update also includes the fixes for the related issues CVE-2016-8884
    and CVE-2016-8885 which complete the patch for CVE-2016-8690.

CVE-2017-13748

    It was discovered that jasper does not properly release memory used
    to store image tile data when image decoding fails which may lead to
    a denial-of-service.

CVE-2017-14132

    A heap-based buffer over-read was found related to the
    jas_image_ishomosamp function that could be triggered via a crafted
    image file and may cause a denial-of-service (application crash) or
    have other unspecified impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.900.1-debian1-2.4+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.

# jasper: two NULL pointer dereference in bmp\_getdata (bmp\_dec.c)

Posted on [October 16, 2016](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/10/16/jasper-two-null-pointer-dereference-in-bmp_getdata-bmp_dec-c/ "12:07 pm") by [ago](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/author/ago/ "View all posts by ago")

**Description**:

[jasper](http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/jasper/) is an open-source initiative to provide a free software-based reference implementation of the codec specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard.

A fuzzing revelaled two NULL pointer access in bmp\_getdata.

Since jasper seems to be dead for years, I first posted this bug on oss-security. Since few days I noticed that the development is alive on github, I posted the bug to the maintainer which comes with a fast response/fix.

The complete ASan output:

## Description

[![@asarubbo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4741819?v=4&size=48)](/asarubbo)[asarubbo](https://github.com/asarubbo)opened [on Oct 13, 2016](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/21#issue-182793440)

Hello,

time ago I found multiple crashes on jasper. I didn't know where to post the bugs since the development seems dead, so I just informed the community on oss-security.

Now I discovered that the development is still active, here the details:

```
# imginfo $FILE

They have also been addressed via the same upstream commit.  Merging the tracking of both CVEs to single bug.  Prior to the patch, the jpc_siz_getparms() function failed to sanity check values of XRsiz and YRsiz fields of SIZ marker segment.  That could lead to an attempt to perform division by 0, and hence unexpected program termination, inside jpc_dec_process_siz() function.  Both issues are covered by this advisory from the original reporter:  <https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/10/16/jasper-two-divide-by-zero-in-jpc_dec_process_siz-jpc_dec-c/>   [CVE-2016-8691](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-8691) is for the missing check of XRsiz value  Upstream bug report:  <https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/issues/22>  Details from the original reporter's advisory:  # imginfo -f $FILE warning: trailing garbage in marker segment (2 bytes) ASAN:DEADLYSIGNAL ================================================================= ==31103==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: FPE on unknown address 0x7f5b9237e7df (pc 0x7f5b9237e7df bp 0x7fff3818a0c0 sp 0x7fff38189fa0 T0)     #0 0x7f5b9237e7de in jpc_dec_process_siz /tmp/jasper-version-1.900.3/src/libjasper/jpc/jpc_dec.c:1194:17     #1 0x7f5b923842b2 in jpc_dec_decode /tmp/jasper-version-1.900.3/src/libjasper/jpc/jpc_dec.c:390:10     #2 0x7f5b923842b2 in jpc_decode /tmp/jasper-version-1.900.3/src/libjasper/jpc/jpc_dec.c:254     #3 0x7f5b92327a9a in jas_image_decode /tmp/jasper-version-1.900.3/src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c:372:16     #4 0x4f11bd in main /tmp/jasper-version-1.900.3/src/appl/imginfo.c:179:16     #5 0x7f5b9143f61f in __libc_start_main /var/tmp/portage/sys-libs/glibc-2.22-r4/work/glibc-2.22/csu/libc-start.c:289     #6 0x418bc8 in _start (/tmp/jasper-version-1.900.3/src/appl/.libs/imginfo+0x418bc8)  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV /tmp/jasper-version-1.900.3/src/libjasper/bmp/bmp_dec.c:383:5 in bmp_getdata ==15555==ABORTING   These issues were reported upstream in the following bug reports:  <https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/issues/24> <https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/issues/21>  and addressed in version 1.900.5 via this commit:  <https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/commit/8f62b4761711d036fd8964df256b938c809b7fca>  A single CVE id [CVE-2016-8690](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-8690) was originally assigned for these issues:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/155>   However, that fix did not address the underlying issue.  The change to the bmp_getint32() function prevented triggering of the problem with originally provided reproducers, but reporter was able to create a different reproducer that does not trigger the problem in versions prior to 1.900.5, but does trigger it in 1.900.5.

Negative values could cause the created matrix to be initialized into an inconsistent state - with data_ being NULL and datasize_ being non-0 / negative.  That could later lead to dereference of the NULL data_ pointer.  It's likely to be write attempt close to NULL, but can theoretically be further away from NULL and hence accessing writeable memory.  Provided test case that trigger the problem via BMP decoder only trigger a write close to NULL, limiting impact to crash.  Two separate CVE ids [CVE-2016-8884](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-8884) and [CVE-2016-8885](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-8885) were assigned for the incomplete fix, even though the original issue only got single CVE.

Subject: Fuzzing jasper

Hello all,

I fuzzed jasper and it revealed some crashes,
we know that jasper has no more release(s) since a lot of time, so there are
some unfixed vulnerabilities.
Based on what I said, I don't know if any of the following crashes have been
reported in the past.

I know that Jasper clearly state about its capability on the BMP format, so if
you think that something is suitable for an identifier, please assign one.
Thanks.

NOTE: The command used in all cases was: imginfo $CRAFTED_IMAGE

1)
THE BMP FORMAT IS NOT FULLY SUPPORTED!
THAT IS, THE JASPER SOFTWARE CANNOT DECODE ALL TYPES OF BMP DATA.
IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, PLEASE TRY CONVERTING YOUR IMAGE DATA
TO THE PNM FORMAT, AND USING THIS FORMAT INSTEAD.
