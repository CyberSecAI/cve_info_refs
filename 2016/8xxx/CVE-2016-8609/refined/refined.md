Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an incorrect implementation of the authentication flow in Keycloak. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the authorization code during the authentication process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authorization Code Fixation:** The primary vulnerability is an authorization code fixation flaw. This means an attacker can obtain a valid authorization code and use it to hijack a legitimate user's session.
- The authentication flow is not robust enough, allowing for the exploitation of the authorization code.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform account hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack user sessions.
- **Information Disclosure:** Successfully hijacking a session could expose user information.
- **Further Attacks:** The access gained through session hijacking could be used to perform further malicious attacks on the compromised user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Phishing URL:** An attacker can create a malicious phishing URL that appears legitimate.
- **Authorization Code Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the authentication process to obtain and then use a valid authorization code to gain access to the victim's account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to construct a Phishing URL:** The attacker must be able to craft a convincing phishing link that redirects victims to the legitimate authentication server.
- **Some knowledge of the Authentication Flow:** The attacker must have an understanding of how the authorization code is generated and used.
- The attacker need not be authenticated or local. The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Keycloak version 2.3.0.
- The specific flaw is tracked as KEYCLOAK-3692 in the JBoss issue tracker.
- Hiroyuki Wada of Nomura Research Institute was credited for discovering the issue.
- Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.0 is identified as an affected product and was patched in RHSA-2016:2945
