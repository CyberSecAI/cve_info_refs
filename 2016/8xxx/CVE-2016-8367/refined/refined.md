Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is **uncontrolled resource consumption** in the web server component of Schneider Electric's Magelis HMI devices. An attacker can open multiple connections to the web server, keeping these connections open and preventing new, legitimate connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')**: The web server lacks proper controls to limit resource usage by incoming connections, which leads to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a DoS for affected devices. The web server becomes unavailable, disrupting the normal functionality of the HMI.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
-  **Multiple connections:** The attacker opens multiple connections to the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  **Low skill level:** An attacker with low skill can exploit the vulnerabilities.
-  **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted device's web server.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory indicates the vendor released a new software version (Vijeo XD, Version 2.4.2) that removes the vulnerable web-server component.
-  For users who still need the web server feature, the advisory provides mitigations.
-  Publicly available exploit information exists.
-  The vendor's CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 5.3.
-  The advisory also references another related vulnerability, CVE-2016-8374, which has a higher CVSS score (7.5) and can lead to a more severe DoS.
