  "CVE-2016-8735": {
    "description": "The JmxRemoteLifecycleListener was not updated to take account of Oracle's fix for CVE-2016-3427. Therefore, Tomcat installations using this listener remained vulnerable to a similar remote code execution vulnerability. This issue has been rated as important rather than critical due to the small number of installations using this listener and that it would be highly unusual for the JMX ports to be accessible to an attacker even when the listener is used.",
    "root_cause": "The JmxRemoteLifecycleListener did not incorporate the fix for CVE-2016-3427, leaving a remote code execution vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote code execution vulnerability in JmxRemoteLifecycleListener"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
         "Remote"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need network access to the JMX ports, which is usually not exposed.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability existed because the JmxRemoteLifecycleListener was not updated to take account of Oracle's fix for CVE-2016-3427, and the JMX ports are not commonly accessible."
