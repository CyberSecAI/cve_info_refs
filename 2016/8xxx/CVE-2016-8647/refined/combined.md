| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1396174#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2016-11-17 16:48:48 UTC  ```  It is reported that in Ansible, under some circumstances the mysql_user module may fail to correctly change a password. Thus an old password may still be active when it should have been changed.

| This is a security issue because setting a cleartext password for users with auth\_plugin other than mysql\_native\_password in MySQL 5.7+ does nothing, completes 'succesfully' and generates no error or warning.  This specifically goes wrong with percona 5.7. The root-user deafult has the unix-socket plugin configured, so setting pw is a no-op. |

| [@abadger](https://github.com/abadger): no the special syntax is only executed on 5.7+, otherwise it falls back to the old syntax. The MySQL-version check was already available. |

| But maybe the capability check variable "old\_user\_mgmt" could be named clearer.  The original intent was to check only the removal of old style user management in 5.7+. But that is not the only thing that is different. Suggestions? |

| Notes from my testing.  On a default install of mysql (percona in my tests) 5.7 a temporary password is set, and can be viewed in the mysql log. The password is technically expired (although the mysql command allows you to login with it) trying to login using ansible will throw the following error.  ``` fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "unable to connect to database, check login_user and login_password are correct or /root/.my.cnf has the credentials. Exception message: (1862, 'Your password has expired. To log in you must change it using a client that supports expired passwords.')"}  ```  So the password must be changed manually before ansible will work.  Trying to update the password following examples from mysql.com will give the following errors  ```  mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('MyNewPass'); ERROR 1819 (HY000): Your password does not satisfy the current policy requirements mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('MyNewPass1'); ERROR 1819 (HY000): Your password does not satisfy the current policy requirements mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('MyNewPass1@#'); Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)  ```  Now that the password is changed, ansible will work  ``` [root@centos7 ansible]# vi playbook.yaml                                                                                                                                                       [root@centos7 ansible]# ansible-playbook -i localhost playbook.yaml                                                                                                                             [WARNING]: Host file not found: localhost   [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available   PLAY [Test] **********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************  TASK [mysql_user] **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** changed: [localhost]  PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** localhost                  : ok=1    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0     [root@centos7 ansible]# ansible-playbook -i localhost playbook.yaml   [WARNING]: Host file not found: localhost   [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available   PLAY [Test] **********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************  TASK [mysql_user] **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "unable to connect to database, check login_user and login_password are correct or /root/.my.cnf has the credentials.

| [@Jmainguy](https://github.com/Jmainguy): Looks you tested another problem. The test is if you can set a password for a user if it has auth\_sock enabled. (This was the case in my 'default install' using the PPA in Ubuntu from Percona.)  My patch just fixed this specific case for a user with auth\_socket plugin configured:  <https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/03/16/change-user-password-in-mysql-5-7-with-plugin-auth_socket/>  It's not depending on [#3589](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/pull/3589). If you look at the code you see it already uses 'ALTER USER ... WITH mysql\_native\_password' in some cases but not all. It just fixes mysql\_user with cleartextpw's to behave the same way as with hashes.  So it's not a feature but a bug. |

| So, as usual I was super confused.  This PR affects setting the mysql\_native\_password (which ansible supports atm), and it affects mysql / forks greater than or equal to 5.7, and also all of mariadb. Before we were not explicitly calling out the plugin to use, this PR fixes that so that if another plugin is the default, that the native\_password plugin still gets updated (which is the default for everything I have used personally). I tested the PR and it works.  ``` [root@phy01 ansible]# ansible -i hosts all -m mysql_user -a 'name=root password="jimboadasdadasd!$(AA123aa"'                                                                                   centos7.soh.re | SUCCESS => {     "changed": true,      "user": "root" } [root@phy01 ansible]# ansible -i hosts all -m mysql_user -a 'name=root password="jimboadasdadasd!$(AA123aa"' centos7.soh.re | FAILED! => {     "changed": false,      "failed": true,      "msg": "unable to connect to database, check login_user and login_password are correct or /root/.my.cnf has the credentials.

## Synopsis

Important: ansible security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1685)

## Topic

An update for ansible is now available for RHEV Engine version 4.1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Ansible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote-task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: ansible (2.3.0.0). (BZ#1446527)

Security Fix(es):

* An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible server privileges. (CVE-2016-9587)
* An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible, and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible server privileges. (CVE-2017-7466)
* An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's mysql\_user module which may fail to correctly change a password in certain circumstances. Thus the previous password would still be active when it should have been changed. (CVE-2016-8647)

The CVE-2017-7466 issue was discovered by Evgeni Golov (Red Hat).
