      "root_cause": "An input validation vulnerability in Ansible's mysql_user module.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The mysql_user module in Ansible may fail to correctly change a password in certain circumstances.",

      "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be in a position to cause the conditions where the module may fail to correctly change the password. Specific circumstances where this failure may occur include instances where the auth_plugin is not `mysql_native_password` on MySQL 5.7+."
