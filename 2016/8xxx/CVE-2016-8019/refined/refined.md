Based on the provided exploit-db entry, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-8019:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the McAfee Virus Scan Enterprise for Linux web interface. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session within the web interface.
- Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect the user to malicious sites, or deface the web interface.
- This XSS vulnerability is part of a chain of vulnerabilities that, when combined, allow remote code execution as root.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of McAfee Virus Scan Enterprise for Linux.
- An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code through a vulnerable parameter or input field within the application's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable McAfee Virus Scan Enterprise for Linux server. 
- Since the attack exploits an XSS vulnerability, there is no indication that a specific authentication is necessary for the attack to be successful, however this attack is used in a chain of attacks.
- In the exploit provided, an attacker exploits multiple CVEs in order to gain remote code execution. The exploitation process is the following:
1.  Crack a valid authentication cookie (CVE-2016-8023, CVE-2016-8022).
2.  Change the update server to attacker controlled server (CVE-2016-8018).
3.  Force target to download a malicious payload (CVE-2016-8021)
4.  Execute the downloaded payload (CVE-2016-8020, CVE-2016-8019)
