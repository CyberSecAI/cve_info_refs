Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of memory release after the execution of a specific command on Huawei firewalls.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is a memory leak caused by a specific command not releasing allocated memory.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to memory exhaustion, resulting in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, making the firewall unresponsive.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a remote attacker logging into a vulnerable device and sending a large number of specific commands.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have remote access with specific permissions to log in to the firewall to be able to send the crafted commands.
