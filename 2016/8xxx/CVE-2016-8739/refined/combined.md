| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1406811#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-12-21 14:34:42 UTC  ```  Apache CXF JAX-RS implementation provides a number of Atom MessageBodyReaders. These readers use Apache Abdera Parser to parse Atom feeds or Entries, with this Parser expanding XML entities by default. This represents a major XXE risk.   External References:  <http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2016-8739.txt.asc?version=1&modificationDate=1482164360575&api=v2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1406811#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-12-21 14:35:32 UTC  ```  Created cxf tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1406813](show_bug.cgi?id=1406813 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-6812 CVE-2016-8739 cxf: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1406811#c5)  Jason Shepherd    2016-12-22 05:25:40 UTC  ``` JBoss EAP 6 and 7 implement JAX-RS using Resteasy, not CXF. Therefore the vulnerable AbstractAtomProvider class is not part of either distribution.

# RHSA-2017:0868 - Security Advisory

* [概述](#overview)

## 概述

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.3 R2 security and bug fix update

## 类型/严重性

Security Advisory: Important

## 标题

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

Security Fix(es):

* It was reported that Elasticsearch had vulnerabilities in the Groovy scripting engine, which allow an attacker to construct scripts that escape the sandbox and execute shell commands as the user running the Elasticsearch Java VM. (CVE-2015-1427)
* It was found that a flaw in Apache groovy library allows remote code execution wherever deserialization occurs in the application. It is possible for an attacker to craft a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability. (CVE-2016-6814)
* It was found that Apache Commons HttpClient does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate. (CVE-2012-5783)
* It was found that swagger-ui contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the key names in the JSON document. An attacker could use this flaw to supply a key name with script tags which could cause arbitrary code execution. Additionally it is possible to load the arbitrary JSON files remotely via the URL query-string parameter. (CVE-2016-1000229)
* A vulnerability was found in FormattedServiceListWriter in Apache CXF HTTP transport module that could allow an attacker to inject unexpected matrix parameters into the request URL. On a successful injection these matrix parameters will find their way back to the client in the services list page which represents an XSS risk to the client. (CVE-2016-6812)
* Apache CXF JAX-RS implementation provides a number of Atom MessageBodyReaders. These readers use Apache Abdera Parser to parse Atom feeds or Entries, with this Parser expanding XML entities by default. It was found that this represents a major XXE risk. (CVE-2016-8739)
* A path traversal issue was found in Spark version 2.5 and potentially earlier versions. The vulnerability resides in the functionality to serve static files where there's no protection against directory traversal attacks. This could allow attackers access to private files including sensitive data. (CVE-2016-9177)
* It was found that the camel-snakeyaml component is exploitable for code execution. An attacker could use this vulnerability to send specially crafted payload to a camel-snakeyaml endpoint and causing a remote code execution attack. (CVE-2017-3159)

## 解决方案

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:
