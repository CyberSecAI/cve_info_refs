{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Apache CXF JAX-RS implementation provides Atom MessageBodyReaders that use the Apache Abdera Parser. This parser, by default, expands XML entities, leading to an XXE vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit the XXE vulnerability to potentially read arbitrary files from the server, conduct denial of service attacks, or perform other malicious activities by injecting specially crafted XML entities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the Atom MessageBodyReaders in Apache CXF JAX-RS, which process XML input that can contain malicious external entity declarations.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a malicious XML payload to an application that uses the vulnerable Apache CXF library. No special positioning is required as long as the application is accessible."
