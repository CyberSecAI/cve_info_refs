# RHSA-2017:2494 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies.

This release provides an update to OpenSSL and Tomcat 6/7 for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.2. The updates are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve several security issues.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat's handling of pipelined requests when "Sendfile" was used. If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647)
* A vulnerability was discovered in the error page mechanism in Tomcat's DefaultServlet implementation. A crafted HTTP request could cause undesired side effects, possibly including the removal or replacement of the custom error page. (CVE-2017-5664)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration files).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1401528#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-05 14:06:56 UTC  ``` The HTTP/2 protocol implementation (mod_http2) had an incomplete handling of the LimitRequestFields directive. This allowed an attacker to inject unlimited request headers into the server, leading to eventual memory exhaustion.  Affects all versions from  2.4.17 to  2.4.23.  Mitigation:  As a temporary workaround - HTTP/2 can be disabled by changing the configuration by removing h2 and h2c from the Protocols line(s) in the configuration file.   The resulting line should read:  		Protocols http/1.1  External References:  <https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html> <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2016/Dec/3>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1401528#c2)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-05 14:10:43 UTC  ```  Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1401530](show_bug.cgi?id=1401530 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-8740 httpd: Incomplete handling of LimitRequestFields directive in mod_http2 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1401528#c3)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-05 14:13:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1228070](attachment.cgi?id=1228070&action=diff "httpd 2.4.23 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1228070&action=edit "httpd 2.4.23 patch") httpd 2.4.23 patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1401528#c4)  Doran Moppert    2016-12-16 04:16:01 UTC  ``` This doesn't affect default configurations, the impact is limited to a crash and there is amplification - ie, the attacker needs to send O(total available memory) bytes to cause a crash.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1401528#c5)  Doran Moppert    2016-12-16 04:17:57 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact.

```
In August, Shi Lei from Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc., found a Denial of Service issue in OpenSSL while openssl is handling
"SSL3_AL_WARNING" undefined alerts.
This issue has been assigned with CVE number, CVE-2016-8610, and it was called 'SSL-Death-Alert'.

The story is as follow.

We reported this issue to OpenSSL team in early September, and they told us they won't treat it as a security issue,
but they allowed us to discuss it with whomever we wish.

BTW, the issue has been fixed in the official release on September 22nd.

As the saying goes in 'The X Files', the truth is out there. Security researchers write exploits because they like the
truth.

With further research in this flaw, we found that it could easily cause a DoS to those which use OpenSSL to support
SSL(e.g, Nginx). For instance, visitors couldn't open the website powered by nginx until the attack stops.

Considering the widely deployment of the combination of nginx with OpenSSL in nowaday's web servers, we believe this is
an important issue that has a huge influence.

After internal team discussion，we choose to disclose the details together with the Red Hat Product Security Team.

With the help of Huzaifa Sidhpurwala from Red Hat Product Security Team, this issue has been further confirmed and has
been informed to both the nginx team and other Linux distros.

At last, we were very grateful to the Red Hat Security Team and the OpenSSL Team for their help!

Details about the security flaw:

=======

Product: OpenSSL

Affected Versions: 1.1.0, 1.0.2 - 1.0.2h, All 1.0.1, All 0.9.8

Vulnerability Type: DoS

Vendor URL: <https://www.openssl.org/>

CVE ID: CVE-2016-8610

Name: SSL Death Alert

Description

============

It was found that function "ssl3_read_bytes" in ssl/s3_pkt.c might lead to higher CPU usage due to improper handling of
warning packets.

An attacker could repeat the undefined plaintext warning packets of "SSL3_AL_WARNING" during the handshake, which will
easily make to consume 100% CPU on the server. It is an implementation problem in OpenSSL that OpenSSL would ignore
undefined warning, and continue dealing with the remaining data(if exist). So the attacker could pack multiple alerts
inside a single record and send a large number of there large records. Then the server will be fallen in a meaningless
cycle, and not available to any others.

Any ssl supported server which used OpenSSL may be influenced.

A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could easy cause a DoS attack to the server (such as openssl s_server,
nginx, etc).

Shi Lei from Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc., reported this vulnerability.

For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k  External References:  <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20170126.txt>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2017-01-26 15:55:36 UTC  ``` Upstream commits:  <https://git.openssl.org/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2198b3a55de681e1f3c23edb0586afe13f438051> <https://git.openssl.org/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=8e20499629b6bcf868d0072c7011e590b5c2294d>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-26 16:07:37 UTC  ```  Created openssl101e tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1416866](show_bug.cgi?id=1416866 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-3731 openssl101e: openssl: Truncated packet could crash via OOB read [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c3)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-26 16:08:01 UTC  ```  Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1416864](show_bug.cgi?id=1416864 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-3731 CVE-2017-3732 openssl: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c4)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-26 16:08:24 UTC  ```  Created mingw-openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1416865](show_bug.cgi?id=1416865 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2017-3731 CVE-2017-3732 mingw-openssl: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1416867](show_bug.cgi?id=1416867 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2017-3731 CVE-2017-3732 mingw-openssl: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c9)  Tomas Mraz    2017-01-30 10:23:14 UTC  ``` Also note that for 1.0.1e the upstream fix is insufficient - the check for return value from EVP_CTRL_AEAD_TLS1_AAD has to be added in t1_enc.c.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2017-01-30 10:58:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Mraz from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c9)) > Also note that for 1.0.1e the upstream fix is insufficient - the check for > return value from EVP_CTRL_AEAD_TLS1_AAD has to be added in t1_enc.c.

Problem can be mitigated by disabling this cipher in configuration of an application using OpenSSL (if the application allows that).   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-02-20 10:56:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:0286 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0286.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-12 16:05:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Core Services  Via RHSA-2018:2187 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2187](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2187)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-12 16:14:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2018:2186 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2186](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2186)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1416852#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-12 16:17:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2018:2185 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2185](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2185)   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2493)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies.

This release provides an update to OpenSSL and Tomcat 6/7 for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.2. The updates are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve several security issues.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat's handling of pipelined requests when "Sendfile" was used. If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647)
* A vulnerability was discovered in the error page mechanism in Tomcat's DefaultServlet implementation. A crafted HTTP request could cause undesired side effects, possibly including the removal or replacement of the custom error page. (CVE-2017-5664)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration files).

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

RHSA-2017:1415 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2017-06-07
Updated:
2017-06-07
# RHSA-2017:1415 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

RHSA-2017:1802 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2017-07-25
Updated:
2017-07-25
# RHSA-2017:1802 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Web Server Service Pack 1 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector (mod\_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod\_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat Native library.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)
* A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat's handling of pipelined requests when "Sendfile" was used. If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647)
* A vulnerability was discovered in the error page mechanism in Tomcat's DefaultServlet implementation. A crafted HTTP request could cause undesired side effects, possibly including the removal or replacement of the custom error page. (CVE-2017-5664)
* A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat. When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager it was possible, under some circumstances, for that application to retain references to the request or response objects and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another web application. (CVE-2017-5648)

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration files).

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

RHSA-2017:1659 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2017-06-28
Updated:
2017-06-28
# RHSA-2017:1659 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.16 natives update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

This release includes bug fixes as well as a new release of OpenSSL that addresses a number of outstanding security flaws. For further information, see the knowledge base article linked to in the References section. All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections form other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1413)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat.

Algorithms such as (cryptographic) hashing and encryption typically have a lifetime after which they are considered either too risky to use or plain insecure. That would mean we need to phase out such algorithms from the default settings, or completely disable if they could cause irreparable issue.

# CVE-2016-8610: SSL-Death-Alert OpenSSL SSL/TLS SSL3\_AL\_WARNING undefined alert flood remote DoS

## Overview

![CCS-Injection logo](logo.png)

It was found that function "ssl3\_read\_bytes" in ssl/s3\_pkt.c might lead to higher CPU usage due to improper handling of warning packets.

An attacker could repeat the undefined plaintext warning packets of "SSL3\_AL\_WARNING" during the handshake, which will cause a 100% CPU usage on the server.

It is an implementation problem in OpenSSL that OpenSSL would ignore undefined warning, and continue dealing with the remaining data(if exist).

So the attacker could pack multiple alerts inside a single record and send a large number of these large records.

Then the server will be fallen in a meaningless cycle, and not available to any others.

BTW, Huzaifa Sidhpurwala from the Red Hat Product Security Team was found that the same issue may also affect gnutls servers.

## Countermeasures

You can apply software updates from each software vendors. Refer to the URLs below.

* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/source/)
* [Debian](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8610 "Debian")
* [Redhat/CentOS](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-8610 "Redhat/CentOS")

Patch link:

<https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=af58be768ebb690f78530f796e92b8ae5c9a4401>
## Problem

A. The attacker could send an excessively large overlapping alert packets (multiple alerts inside a single record) to cause a Denial of Service attack to the server.

## Q. What is the impact of the vulnerability?

A. The vulnerability affects most versions of OpenSSL. Any ssl supported server which used OpenSSL may be influenced. Nginx  in particularly  could be  easily  made to deny service( e.g: Loopback , 1G NIC ).

## Q. What versions of OpenSSL are affected?

A. Affected Versions:

* OpenSSL All 0.9.8
* OpenSSL All 1.0.1
* OpenSSL 1.0.2 through 1.0.2h
* OpenSSL 1.1.0

Not Affected Versions:

* OpenSSL 1.0.2i, 1.0.2j
* OpenSSL 1.1.0a, 1.1.0b

## Q. How to prevent the attacks?

A. Upgrade to the latest version.

## Q. Do I need to regenerate my private keys or certificates?

A. No. Attackers could not steal your private keys through this vulnerability.

## Q. Is this because of an SSL/TLS specification defect?

A. It's not sure.

## Q. What protocol versions are affected?

A. All versions (SSL3.0, TLS1.0, TLS1.1, TLS1.2) are affected.

## Q. What encryption algorithms are affected?

A. All encryption algorithms are affected. This bug is not related to any specific algorithms.

## Q. Can I be aware of this kind of attack when it is happening?

A. It's hard to say.

## Q. How did you find this bug?

A. This bug was discovered by Shi Lei of the Gear Team, Information Security Department, Qihoo 360 Inc. while doing code review.

Huzaifa Sidhpurwala from the Red Hat Product Security Team was found the same issue also in gnutls servers.

## Q. How did you handle this vulnerability?

A. We reported it to the official after we found this vulnerability, and they tell us they won't treat it as security issue.

Then we discuss with the Red Hat Product Security Team after the official release a fixed version.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2016-10-14 03:49:42 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL processed ALERT packets during an SSL handshake. A attacker basically sends a large number of plaintext WARNING pkgs after CLIENTHELLO, which causes OpenSSL to go into a endless loop (while the attacker keeps on sending more alert packets), consequently taking 100% CPU. This may cause certain applications compiled against OpenSSL to hang and may not be able to serve content to the clients. This is specially true about for servers which do not for or allocate extra thread for the processing of ClientHello like nginx.   This is fixed in OpenSSL upstream commit via:  <https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=af58be768ebb690f78530f796e92b8ae5c9a4401>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c6)  Huzaifa S.

However, as gnutls delegates the burden of warning alerts to the application, there may be servers not vulnerable. I think the openssl fix of adding a maximum number of received handshakes is reasonable and there is already a similar at gnutls.  <https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/1ffb827e45721ef56982d0ffd5c5de52376c428e>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c8)  Huzaifa S.

Nginx is affected by this issue; Apache httpd is not affected by this issue. This issue has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. It requires an attacker to send a very large amount of SSL ALERT messages to the host network connection. This issue can also be mitigated by configuring firewalls to limit the number of connections per IP address, or use deep packet inspection to reject these type of alert packets. A future update may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c9)  Huzaifa S.

To provide a complete single nginx worker lockup an attacker should be able to provide a rather big SSL ALERT messages flow comparable to the host network connection bandwidth, which is often difficult to achieve.  3. This type of attack can be controlled by various means on the network layer for example by configuring firewalls to limit number of connections per ip address, use deep packet inspection to reject these type of alert packets etc.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c14)  Huzaifa S.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Don't allow too many consecutive warning alerts

```
Certain warning alerts are ignored if they are received. This can mean that
no progress will be made if one peer continually sends those warning alerts.
Implement a count so that we abort the connection if we receive too many.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1658)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

This release includes bug fixes as well as a new release of OpenSSL. For further information, see the knowledge base article linked to in the References section. All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the same system. (CVE-2016-2178)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections form other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-7056 CVE-2016-8610 CVE-2017-3731

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL:

CVE-2016-7056

    A local timing attack was discovered against ECDSA P-256.

CVE-2016-8610

    It was discovered that no limit was imposed on alert packets during
    an SSL handshake.

CVE-2017-3731

    Robert Swiecki discovered that the RC4-MD5 cipher when running on
    32 bit systems could be forced into an out-of-bounds read, resulting
    in denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1t-1+deb8u6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0d-1 of the openssl source package and in version 1.0.2k-1
of the openssl1.0 source package.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

# RHSA-2017:0574 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: gnutls security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0574)

## Topic

An update for gnutls is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The gnutls packages provide the GNU Transport Layer Security (GnuTLS) library, which implements cryptographic algorithms and protocols such as SSL, TLS, and DTLS.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: gnutls (2.12.23). (BZ#1321112, BZ#1326073, BZ#1415682, BZ#1326389)

Security Fix(es):

* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections form other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* Multiple flaws were found in the way gnutls processed OpenPGP certificates. An attacker could create specially crafted OpenPGP certificates which, when parsed by gnutls, would cause it to crash. (CVE-2017-5335, CVE-2017-5336, CVE-2017-5337)

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 Release Notes and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 Technical Notes linked from the References section.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1441205#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-04-11 12:35:09 UTC  ``` A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests when send file was used resulted in the pipelined request being lost when send file processing of the previous request completed. This could result in responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request. For example, a user agent that sent requests A, B and C could see the correct response for request A, the response for request C for request B and no response for request C.  Affected versions: 6.0.0 to 6.0.52, 7.0.0 to 7.0.76, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.42, 8.5.0 to 8.5.12  Upstream fixes:  Tomcat 6.x: <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1789024> <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1789155> <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1789856>  Tomcat 7.x:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1789008>  Tomcat 8.0.x:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1788999>  Tomcat 8.5.x:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1788932>  References:  <https://tomcat.apache.org/security-6.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_6.0.53> <https://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_7.0.77> <https://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_8.0.43> <https://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_8.5.13>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1441205#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-04-11 13:31:43 UTC  ``` Created jbossweb tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openshift-1 [[bug 1441243](show_bug.cgi?id=1441243)]   Created tomcat tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1441241](show_bug.cgi?id=1441241 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-5647 CVE-2017-5648 tomcat: various flaws [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1441242](show_bug.cgi?id=1441242 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-5647 CVE-2017-5648 tomcat: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1441205#c11)  Timothy Walsh    2017-05-12 10:41:09 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  The AJP connector does not support the sendfile capability.  A server configured to only use the AJP connector (disable HTTP Connector) is not affected by this vulnerability.  Disable the sendfile capability by setting useSendfile="false" in the HTTP connector configuration.  Note: Disabling sendfile, may impact performance on large files.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1441205#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-07-25 16:45:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3 for RHEL 7   Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:1801 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1801](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1801)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1441205#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-07-25 17:46:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1.1  Via RHSA-2017:1802 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1802](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1802)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1441205#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-21 15:26:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2  Via RHSA-2017:2494 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2494](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2494)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1441205#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-21 15:35:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2 for RHEL 6   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:2493 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2493](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2493)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1441205#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-30 00:16:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:3080 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3080](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3080)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1441205#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-30 00:28:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:3081 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3081](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3081)   ``` |  |

For a list of CVEs and their impact on validated FIPS providers, visit the [CVEs and FIPS](/news/fips-cve) page.

Please follow the Security Policy instructions to download, build and
install a validated OpenSSL FIPS provider.
Other OpenSSL Releases MAY use the validated FIPS provider, but
MUST NOT build and use their own FIPS provider. For example you can build
OpenSSL 3.4 and use the OpenSSL 3.0.9 FIPS provider with it.

Information about how to configure and use the FIPS provider in your
applications is available on the FIPS module man page.
You must also read the module security policy and follow the specific
build and installation instructions included in it.

For an overview of some of the key concepts in OpenSSL 3.4 see the
[OpenSSL Guide](https://docs.openssl.org/3.4/man7/ossl-guide-introduction/).
Much of the information in the guide is also applicable to older releases such
as 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 except for sections relating to new features only in
3.4. Information and notes about migrating existing applications to OpenSSL
3.4 (and 3.3/3.2/3.1/3.0) are available in the [OpenSSL 3.4 Migration
Guide](https://docs.openssl.org/3.4/man7/ossl-guide-migration/)

When building a release for the first time, please make sure to look at
the INSTALL file in the distribution along with any NOTES file
applicable to your platform. If you have problems, then join the
[openssl-users](/community/mailinglists) email list and post a
question there.

PGP keys for the signatures of old releases are available from the [OTC page](https://www.openssl.org/community/otc.html)
and can also be signed with a key with the fingerprint:
[EFC0 A467 D613 CB83 C7ED 6D30 D894 E2CE 8B3D 79F5](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=EFC0+A467+D613+CB83+C7ED+6D30+D894+E2CE+8B3D+79F5).

The current releases are signed by the OpenSSL key with fingerprint [BA54 73A2 B058 7B07 FB27 CF2D 2160 94DF D0CB 81EF](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=openssl%40openssl.org).

Each day we make a snapshot of each development branch. They can be
found at <https://www.openssl.org/source/snapshot/>. These daily
snapshots of the source tree are provided for convenience only and not
even guaranteed to compile. Note that keeping a git local repository and
updating it every 24 hours is equivalent and will often be faster and
more efficient.

Don't allow too many consecutive warning alerts

```
Certain warning alerts are ignored if they are received. This can mean that
no progress will be made if one peer continually sends those warning alerts.
Implement a count so that we abort the connection if we receive too many.

NetApp has a long-held and ongoing commitment to compliance with the ever-evolving set of global, regional, and data security and privacy standards and regulations. We uphold this commitment through self-assessments and rigorous audits by independent accredited third parties. These audits validate the adherence of our products and services to the requirements of such standards as ISO/IEC 27001, the GDPR, and the Common Criteria. These assessments help demonstrate NetApp’s integration of internationally recognized processes and best practices in our business, enabling customers to use our products and services regardless of their compliance needs.

NetApp supplies information for each compliance offering (listed at left) that includes a list of in-scope software and hardware and links to the relevant certificates and auditor’s reports.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

FreeBSD-SA-16:35.openssl Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: OpenSSL Remote DoS vulnerability
Category: contrib
Module: openssl
Announced: 2016-11-02
Affects: FreeBSD 9.x and FreeBSD 10.x.
Corrected: 2016-11-02 07:09:31 UTC (stable/10, 10.3-STABLE)
2016-11-02 07:23:36 UTC (releng/10.3, 10.3-RELEASE-p12)
2016-11-02 07:24:14 UTC (releng/10.2, 10.2-RELEASE-p25)
2016-11-02 07:24:14 UTC (releng/10.1, 10.1-RELEASE-p42)
2016-11-02 07:09:31 UTC (stable/9, 9.3-STABLE)
2016-11-02 07:24:34 UTC (releng/9.3, 9.3-RELEASE-p50)
CVE Name: CVE-2016-8610
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
The SSL alert protocol is a way to communicate problems within a SSL/TLS session.
II. Problem Description
Due to improper handling of alert packets, OpenSSL would consume an excessive
amount of CPU time processing undefined alert messages.
III. Impact
A remote attacker who can initiate handshakes with an OpenSSL based server
can cause the server to consume a lot of computation power with very little
bandwidth usage, and may be able to use this technique in a leveraged Denial
of Service attack.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 10.x]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:35/openssl-10.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:35/openssl-10.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-10.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:35/openssl-9.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:35/openssl-9.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-9.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/9/ r308200
releng/9.3/ r308205

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1801)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1 for RHEL 6 and Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1 for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector (mod\_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod\_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat Native library.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)
* A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat's handling of pipelined requests when "Sendfile" was used. If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647)
* A vulnerability was discovered in the error page mechanism in Tomcat's DefaultServlet implementation. A crafted HTTP request could cause undesired side effects, possibly including the removal or replacement of the custom error page. (CVE-2017-5664)
* A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat. When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager it was possible, under some circumstances, for that application to retain references to the request or response objects and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another web application. (CVE-2017-5648)

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration files).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1414)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2016-10-14 03:49:42 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL processed ALERT packets during an SSL handshake. A attacker basically sends a large number of plaintext WARNING pkgs after CLIENTHELLO, which causes OpenSSL to go into a endless loop (while the attacker keeps on sending more alert packets), consequently taking 100% CPU. This may cause certain applications compiled against OpenSSL to hang and may not be able to serve content to the clients. This is specially true about for servers which do not for or allocate extra thread for the processing of ClientHello like nginx.   This is fixed in OpenSSL upstream commit via:  <https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=af58be768ebb690f78530f796e92b8ae5c9a4401>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2016-10-20 06:46:00 UTC  ``` [CVE-2016-8610](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-8610) was assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c7)  Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos    2016-10-20 06:49:38 UTC  ``` The same issue may also affect gnutls servers. However, as gnutls delegates the burden of warning alerts to the application, there may be servers not vulnerable. I think the openssl fix of adding a maximum number of received handshakes is reasonable and there is already a similar at gnutls.  <https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/1ffb827e45721ef56982d0ffd5c5de52376c428e>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2016-10-24 14:02:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw affects applications that are compiled against OpenSSL or GnuTLS and do not allocate an extra thread for processing ClientHello messages. Nginx is affected by this issue; Apache httpd is not affected by this issue. This issue has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. It requires an attacker to send a very large amount of SSL ALERT messages to the host network connection. This issue can also be mitigated by configuring firewalls to limit the number of connections per IP address, or use deep packet inspection to reject these type of alert packets. A future update may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c9)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2016-10-25 03:12:40 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/224>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c10)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2016-10-25 05:18:47 UTC  ``` Notes:  1.  All nginx versions with SSL support compiled in and openssl 1.0.1*, <=1.0.2i, <=1.1.0a are affected.  2.  To provide a complete single nginx worker lockup an attacker should be able to provide a rather big SSL ALERT messages flow comparable to the host network connection bandwidth, which is often difficult to achieve.  3. This type of attack can be controlled by various means on the network layer for example by configuring firewalls to limit number of connections per ip address, use deep packet inspection to reject these type of alert packets etc.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1384743#c14)  Huzaifa S.

# RHSA-2017:0286 - Security Advisory

* [概述](#overview)
* [更新的软件包](#packages)

## 概述

Moderate: openssl security update

## 类型/严重性

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights 补丁分析

识别并修复受此公告影响的系统。

[查看受影响的系统](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0286)

## 标题

An update for openssl is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Security Fix(es):

* An integer underflow leading to an out of bounds read flaw was found in OpenSSL. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to crash a 32-bit TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL if it used the RC4-MD5 cipher suite. (CVE-2017-3731)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections form other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)

## 解决方案

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.
