{
  "CVE-2016-8610": {
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of warning packets in the function 'ssl3_read_bytes' within the OpenSSL library. OpenSSL ignores undefined warnings and continues processing the remaining data, resulting in a loop consuming excessive CPU.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to improper handling of warning packets.",
       "OpenSSL ignores undefined warning packets, continuing to process remaining data (if any)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a TLS/SSL server to consume an excessive amount of CPU and become unable to accept connections from other clients, effectively causing a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack by sending malformed TLS/SSL ALERT packets."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate handshakes with a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL and repeatedly send undefined plaintext warning packets during the handshake. The attacker needs to send O(total available memory) bytes to cause a crash."
