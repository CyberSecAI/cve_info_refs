Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8355:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect permission assignment for critical resources. The CADD-Solis Medication Safety Software grants an authenticated user elevated privileges on the SQL database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper access control that allows an authenticated user to have elevated privileges on the SQL database. This allows the user to modify drug libraries, add and delete users, and change user permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify drug libraries within the CADD-Solis Medication Safety Software.
- An attacker can add, delete, and modify users' permissions within the CADD-Solis Medication Safety Software.
- While drug libraries can be modified in the software, updating the drug libraries on a pump requires physical access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation is possible. An authenticated user can leverage their access to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CADD-Solis Medication Safety Software.
- The attacker needs to have network access to the system running the vulnerable software.
- Low skill is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
