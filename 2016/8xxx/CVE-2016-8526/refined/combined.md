Vendor description:
-------------------
"Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company, (formerly "Aruba Networks, Inc.")
is a networking vendor selling enterprise wireless LAN and edge access
networking equipment. The company has over 1,800 employees and is
headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. Aruba's core products are access points
(APs), mobility controllers, and network management software through their
Airwave Management Platform product."

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruba_Networks

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends not to use the product in a production environment
until a thorough security review has been performed by security professionals
and all identified issues have been resolved.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) XML External Entity Injection (CVE-2016-8526)
The used XML parser is resolving external XML entities which allows attackers
to read files and send requests to systems on the internal network (e.g port
scanning).

The vulnerability can be exploited by a low privileged read-only user
to read sensitive information / files with malicious XML code.
Note that as Aruba's passwords are encrypted with a shared static key,
privilege escalation to admin role is also possible!

Multiple different functions are affected by XXE.

According to the vendor another researcher has also found one of the XXE issues, hence
credits go to them as well.
Vendor: "Although the team hasn't reproduced this yet, I’ve had other reports
come in through our bug bounty program last month about XXE issues in VisualRF.
One of the issues you reported is the same, and you reported three others that we
haven't seen yet."

2) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2016-8527)
Due to the lack of input validation, an attacker can insert malicious JavaScript
code to be executed under a victim's browser context.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) XML External Entity Injection (CVE-2016-8526)
a) XXE in VisualRF Backup Sites

Login as any user role (including read-only/standard user)
Navigate to VisualRF > Floor Plans > Select 'View' under 'Network' section.
Select a campus (e.g. Default Campus) > Select 'Edit' >
Select action 'Export Floor Plans' > Ok

POST /visualrf/backup_sites HTTP/1.1

$ zip backup_sectest.zip version.xml
  adding: version.xml (deflated 16%)

And then just upload the backup_sectest.zip via the restore functionality.

2) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2016-8527)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
