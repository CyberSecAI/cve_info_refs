Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-8526:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the use of an XML parser that resolves external XML entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The application is vulnerable to XXE injection due to the insecure parsing of XML input. This allows an attacker to include external entities in XML documents, leading to unauthorized access to local files and internal network resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
*   **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers can use the vulnerable application to send requests to other systems on the internal network (e.g., port scanning)
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Since Aruba's passwords are encrypted with a static key, exploiting the XXE could lead to the disclosure of this key, which could further allow privilege escalation to admin role.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious XML Payloads:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious XML payloads that include external entity references.
*   **Multiple Affected Functions:** The exploit details several vulnerable functions, including VisualRF Backup Sites, Visual RF Site Restore and VisualRF Verify.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:**  The attacks are typically performed via HTTP POST requests containing the malicious XML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileged User Access:** A low-privileged user, even a read-only user, can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Aruba AirWave instance.
*   **Ability to Inject XML:** The attacker must be able to inject the malicious XML payloads into vulnerable application endpoints.
*   **Attacker controlled server:** The attacker needs to set up a server to host the malicious DTD file and to receive the exfiltrated data.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided exploit details three separate vulnerable endpoints that are all vulnerable to XXE via the upload of malicious XML.
*   The exploit details how to use a DTD file to exfiltrate data via FTP.
*   The vulnerability was confirmed in Aruba AirWave versions <= 8.2.3 and patched in 8.2.3.1.
*  The vendor received a report about the issue via their bug bounty program prior to the report by SEC Consult, and that one of the issues reported is the same.
