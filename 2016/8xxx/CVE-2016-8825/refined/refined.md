- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver not validating the size of an input buffer in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) when handling DxgkDdiEscape.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input buffer size validation in the driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to denial of service (DoS) or potential escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the ability to interact with the graphics driver, which generally implies local access and the ability to make API calls to the driver, but does not require any specific privileges.
