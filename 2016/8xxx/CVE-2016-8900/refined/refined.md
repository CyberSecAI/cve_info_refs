Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection (sqli-1):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `product_id` parameter in `/framework/modules/ecommerce/controllers/cartController.php` is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** Failure to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `/index.php?controller=cart&action=addItem` with a malicious `product_id` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Basic knowledge of SQL and the ability to send HTTP requests.

2.  **SQL Injection (sqli-2):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `version` and `title` parameters in `/framework/modules/help/controllers/helpController.php` are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
    *   **Weakness:** Failure to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `/index.php?controller=help&action=show` with malicious `version` and/or `title` parameters.
    *  **Required Capabilities**: Basic knowledge of SQL and the ability to send HTTP requests.

3.  **Object Injection -1:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The code in `/framework/modules/core/controllers/expTagController.php` creates a new object using a class name and data provided by the user (`$this->params['mod']` and `$item`).
    *   **Weakness:** Unsafe deserialization/object instantiation with untrusted input.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can instantiate arbitrary classes, potentially leading to remote code execution or other malicious actions. In the example given, the `SimpleXMLElement` class is used to perform an XXE attack.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `/index.php?controller=expTag&action=change_tags` with malicious `mod` and `change_tag[]` parameters.
     *   **Required Capabilities:** Knowledge of PHP object injection and ability to craft malicious payloads.

4.  **Object Injection -2:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Similar to "Object Injection -1", the code in `/framework/modules/core/controllers/expCatController.php` instantiates an object based on user input (`$this->params['mod']` and `$item`).
    *    **Weakness:** Unsafe deserialization/object instantiation with untrusted input.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can instantiate arbitrary classes, potentially leading to remote code execution or other malicious actions. Again, the `SimpleXMLElement` class is used to perform an XXE attack.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `/index.php?controller=expCat&action=change_cats` with malicious `mod` and `change_cat[]` parameters.
       *   **Required Capabilities:** Knowledge of PHP object injection and ability to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional details from the Github commit:**

The Github commit `fdafb5ec97838e4edbd685f587f28d3174ebb3db` shows the code changes made to address these vulnerabilities. It includes modifications to multiple files such as:

*   `framework/core/controllers/expController.php`: Sanitization of input parameters like `tag`, `title`, and `id` using functions like `expString::escape()` is added
*   `framework/core/expFramework.php`: Changes to how permissions are handled.
*  `framework/core/models/expRecord.php`: Input validation.

These changes suggest a comprehensive effort to sanitize user inputs and enhance the security of the application.

**Summary**

This content provides detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in ExponentCMS, including SQL injection and object injection flaws. The provided proof-of-concept exploits clearly demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can be exploited, and the fixes committed to Github confirm the resolution of the issues.
