- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A wrongly bounded call to `memcpy` while parsing JBIG2 segments in a PDF file. The source buffer is smaller than the size argument of memcpy, leading to an out-of-bounds read from the heap.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds heap read. The vulnerability is in the code responsible for parsing symbol dictionary segments, specifically when a segment refers to another segment with specific SDTEMPLATE values and bitmap coding context used settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. By controlling the size of the copy operation, an attacker can leak heap memory layout, including metadata, addresses and pointers, potentially leading to an ASLR bypass.
- **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted PDF file containing specially crafted JBIG2 segments, which is opened by the vulnerable Foxit PDF Reader.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create or modify PDF documents and then induce the victim to open it using the vulnerable version of Foxit Reader.
