Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-8797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the packet processing module of certain Huawei products when handling Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packets. Specifically, abnormal MPLS packets cause the device to repeatedly allocate memory without releasing it, leading to memory exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory management: The device fails to properly release memory allocated during the processing of abnormal MPLS packets, resulting in a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: An attacker can repeatedly send abnormal MPLS packets, eventually exhausting the device's memory. This can lead to service disruption and potentially make the device unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.
- Exploitation involves sending specifically crafted, abnormal MPLS packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network connectivity to the target device.
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted, abnormal MPLS packets.

**Affected Products (with specific versions):**
- AR3200, S12700, S5300, S5700, S6300, S6700, S7700, S9300, S9700 series devices. Specific affected versions are listed in the table within the document.

**Mitigation/Fix:**
- Huawei has released software updates to address this vulnerability. The document provides details on the resolved versions and upgrade paths.
