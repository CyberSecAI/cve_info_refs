- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, leading to path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could use specially crafted packets to upload files to the hard disk, create or delete directories, or move existing files on the hard disk. This can lead to arbitrary file manipulation on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network; specially crafted packets sent to the ALM default port 4410/TCP
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker with network access to the ALM server on port 4410/TCP. No user interaction is required.
