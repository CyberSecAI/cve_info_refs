    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2016-8575",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `q933_print()` function within the `print-fr.c` file of tcpdump.",
      "details": "The `print-fr.c` file contains a function `q933_print()` which has a buffer overflow. This vulnerability can be triggered when tcpdump processes a malformed frame relay packet.",
        "affected_functions": [
          "q933_print() in print-fr.c"
        ],
      "root_cause": "Buffer overflow in the `q933_print` function within `print-fr.c` when handling malformed frame relay packets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious frame relay packet or pcap file.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted frame relay packet",
        "Malicious pcap file"
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to either send specially crafted packets to the network segment where tcpdump is running in live capture mode, or provide a crafted pcap file for processing.",
