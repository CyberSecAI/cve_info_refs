Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8700:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow within the `bm_readbody_bmp` function in `bitmap_io.c` of potrace. Specifically, this particular instance of the overflow occurs at line 652 within that function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The code attempts to read data into a heap-allocated buffer without proper bounds checking, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow as identified by AddressSanitizer.
-   **Potential for Remote Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, heap-based buffer overflows can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution by a skilled attacker, which can lead to full system compromise, but this is not explicitly confirmed in the text.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Crafted BMP image:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted BMP image file with the potrace utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to provide input to potrace:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious BMP image to the potrace application. This could be done by:
    *   Convincing a user to process the malicious BMP file locally.
    *   If potrace is used in a server-side environment, exploiting an upload mechanism to process the image.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzz testing with American Fuzzy Lop.
*   The blog post mentions that there are six separate heap-based buffer overflows in the same `bm_readbody_bmp` function, each triggered at different locations in the code. CVE-2016-8700 corresponds to the overflow at line 652.
*   The affected version is Potrace 1.12, and the fix was included in version 1.13.
*   The vulnerability was reported privately to the upstream developers before being disclosed publicly.
*   The provided AddressSanitizer output shows the exact location of the vulnerability and the size of the read that causes the overflow.
