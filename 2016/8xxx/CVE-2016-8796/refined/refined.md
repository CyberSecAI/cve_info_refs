- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of specific fields within DHCP messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A lack of proper input validation for certain fields in DHCP messages which allows an attacker to send crafted, abnormal DHCP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, making the affected Huawei firewall products unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:**  An unauthenticated attacker can send abnormal DHCP request packets to the affected firewall products over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected firewall. They don't need to authenticate to trigger the vulnerability.
