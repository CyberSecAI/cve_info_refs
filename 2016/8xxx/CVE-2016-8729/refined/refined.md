```
{
  "Root cause": "A negative value for `stride` can be achieved due to integer underflow in the calculation of stride `stride = ((width - 1) >> 3) + 1;`. This negative value is then passed to `memset`, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Integer underflow",
    "Heap-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact": "Memory corruption and potential code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted PDF file containing a malicious JBIG2 image segment.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF file and send it to a victim that uses vulnerable software to process it."
