  "CVE-2016-8623": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51.0. The way curl handles cookies permits other threads to trigger a use-after-free leading to information disclosure.",
    "root_cause": "libcurl allows users to share cookies between multiple easy handles that are concurrently employed by different threads. When cookies to be sent to a server are collected, the matching function collects all cookies to send and the cookie lock is released immediately afterwards. That function however only returns a list with references back to the original strings for name, value, path and so on. Therefore, if another thread quickly takes the lock and frees one of the original cookie structs together with its strings, a use-after-free can occur.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper locking of shared cookies across threads."
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure as a result of a use-after-free vulnerability, another thread can also replace the contents of the cookies from separate HTTP responses or API calls.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Multiple threads sharing cookies.",
      "A thread quickly freeing a cookie struct while another thread is trying to access it."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to trigger a race condition in multithreaded curl applications that share cookies.",
        "remediation": "Upgrade to curl version 7.51.0 or later"
