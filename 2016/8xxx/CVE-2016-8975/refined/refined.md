- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code within the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the web application.
    - Potential disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code through the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to insert data into the web UI that will be rendered by the application. A low privileged user can trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is required (the victim has to visit the page containing the injected malicious script)
