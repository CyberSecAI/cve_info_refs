{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment Communicator driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution within the kernel context. This could potentially allow a malicious application to gain elevated privileges and achieve a permanent device compromise that might require reflashing the operating system to repair the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local malicious application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a local malicious application installed on the device."
