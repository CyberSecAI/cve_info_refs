Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficiently protected credentials stored within the BD Alaris 8000 and 8015 PC Units. Specifically, the devices store wireless network authentication credentials and other sensitive technical data in an unencrypted form on internal flash memory or removable CF cards.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive data, including wireless network credentials, in an unencrypted manner.
*   **Physical Access Required:** The attack requires physical access to the device to extract the data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain access to the host facility's wireless network credentials and other sensitive technical information.
*   **Network Compromise:**  Accessing wireless credentials allows the attacker to potentially compromise the network, impacting other devices.
*   **Data Modification (Alaris 8015):** Physical access to the CF card can allow overwriting application data and logs.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the BD Alaris PC unit.
*   **Disassembly:** In the case of the Alaris 8000, the attacker must disassemble the unit to access the flash memory.
*   **CF Card Manipulation (Alaris 8015):** In the case of Alaris 8015, the attacker can remove the external Wi-Fi card and use a pre-programmed malicious CF card.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the affected BD Alaris device.
*   **Technical Skill:** For the Alaris 8000, the attacker needs some technical skill to disassemble the device and extract data. For the Alaris 8015, the attacker needs the capability to create or obtain a pre-programmed CF card.
*   **No Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content explicitly states that there are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
