- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of ELF section headers within the Hopper Disassembler. The program reads a user-controlled size from the section header without proper validation, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Out-of-bounds write: An attacker can manipulate the section header size to cause the program to write data outside of the intended memory region.
  - Lack of input validation: The program doesn't validate the size read from the section header.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The out-of-bounds write can allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory locations which could be leveraged for remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - A specially crafted ELF file with manipulated section headers triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker must be able to create or modify an ELF file and get the user to open it using the vulnerable Hopper Disassembler.
