  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Two stack overflow vulnerabilities exist in the video driver of Huawei smartphones.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack overflow in video driver"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can crash the system or escalate user privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker must trick a user into installing a malicious application. The malicious application then sends specific parameters to the video driver to trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application. The attacker also needs to know the specific parameters to send to the video driver in order to exploit the stack overflow."
