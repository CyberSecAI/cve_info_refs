## CVE-2016-8909

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing check in the `intel_hda_xfer` function of the Intel HDA emulator. When processing the DMA buffer stream, the code doesn't verify if the buffer length and pointer position are different. If these values are the same, the copy variable can be set to zero leading to an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Infinite loop vulnerability due to missing check in DMA buffer stream processing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) by consuming excessive CPU cycles on the host, potentially causing the QEMU process to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local guest OS administrator can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A privileged user/process inside a guest operating system, with the ability to control the DMA buffer stream in QEMU's Intel HDA emulation.

## CVE-2016-8668
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of a limit on the DMA buffer size within the `rocker_io_writel` function in QEMU's rocker device emulation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read due to an improperly sized DMA buffer, leading to a process crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to a QEMU process crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local guest OS administrators can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local guest OS administrator that has the ability to control the DMA buffer size on a system using the rocker device emulation.

## CVE-2016-9101
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in a memory leak within the i8255x (PRO100) Ethernet controller emulation. Specifically, during a USB device unplug operation, a memory leak can occur if the device is unplugged repeatedly, leading to an accumulation of leaked host memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak in the USB xHCI controller emulation during device unplug operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) on the host due to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing a QEMU process crash or impacting other services.

**Attack vectors:**
- A privileged user inside the guest operating system can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Privileged access within a guest OS, capable of repeatedly unplugging a USB device.

## CVE-2016-8667
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper validation on the interval timer reload value in the `rc4030_write` function within the rc4030 DMA emulation in QEMU.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Divide-by-zero error due to a large interval timer reload value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) on the host due to a QEMU process crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local guest OS administrators can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local guest OS administrator with the ability to manipulate the interval timer reload value on a system using the rc4030 DMA emulation.

## CVE-2016-9104

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflows in the `v9fs_xattr_read` and `v9fs_xattr_write` functions in the 9pfs emulation. The flaw can be triggered by a crafted offset, resulting in an out-of-bounds access during extended attribute read or write operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflows leading to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) via QEMU process crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local guest OS administrators with control over the extended attribute read or write operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A privileged user within the guest OS with the ability to perform 9P file system extended attribute read and write operations.

## CVE-2016-8910
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies within the `rtl8139_cplus_transmit` function of the RTL8139 Ethernet controller emulation, where an infinite loop is caused by the failure to limit the ring descriptor count.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Infinite loop during packet transmission due to missing check for ring descriptor count.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) on the host due to excessive CPU consumption, causing QEMU to hang or crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- A privileged user within the local guest operating system can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A privileged process within a guest OS, with the ability to manipulate the descriptor ring count of the RTL8139 Ethernet controller.

## CVE-2016-9907

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Memory leak in the USB redirector during the unplugging of a usb device, specifically the allocated memory for vm_change_state_handler is not freed in `usbredir_handle_destroy`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak due to un-freed vm_change_state_handler in usbredir destroy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- DoS to host due to leaked host memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- A guest user or process repeatedly plugging and unplugging a usb device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to hotplug and unplug usb devices from within the guest.
