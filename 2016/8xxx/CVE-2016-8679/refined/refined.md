Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8679:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `_dwarf_get_size_of_val` function within the `dwarf_util.c` file of the libdwarf library. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by an out-of-bounds read within the `strlen` function called by `_dwarf_get_size_of_val`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow, specifically an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The immediate impact is a crash of the application, as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer output. However, heap-based buffer overflows can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted DWARF file using tools that utilize libdwarf, such as `dwarfdump`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DWARF file to an application that uses libdwarf, and convince the application to parse the file. This might involve the attacker having access to a vulnerable system's file system, or convincing a user to open a malicious file, for example.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
*   The vulnerability was reported privately to the upstream project before public disclosure.
*   Two commits were required to fix the vulnerability, due to a mistake in the initial fix.
*   The provided blog post includes a full ASan output, detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, and links to the commit fixes.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability and provides links to upstream patches, as well as related tracking bugs.
*   The CVE assignment was initiated after the vulnerability was reported and fixed.
