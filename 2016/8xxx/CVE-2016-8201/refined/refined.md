The provided content describes a vulnerability related to insecure storage of session cookies in VPN applications. However, the CVE ID referenced is **CVE-2016-8201**, which is not directly mentioned as the root cause of the issue. Instead, the content refers to **CVE-2019-1573** and **CVE-2019-11213** as being related to the insecure storage of session cookies in VPN applications. 

Given that the main vulnerability discussed is not related to **CVE-2016-8201**, the provided information will not be specific to **CVE-2016-8201**. 

Here's an analysis of the provided information related to the broader insecure session cookie storage issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the insecure storage of authentication and/or session cookies by multiple VPN applications. This includes storage in memory and log files without proper encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-311:** Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data.
- Insecure storage of cookies in:
  - Log files: Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect Agent, Pulse Desktop Client, Pulse Connect Secure.
  - Memory: Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect Agent, Pulse Desktop Client, Pulse Connect Secure, Cisco AnyConnect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to a VPN user's endpoint can:
   - Exfiltrate the stored cookies.
   - Replay the session, bypassing other authentication methods.
   - Gain access to the same applications as the user through the VPN session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Persistent access to a VPN user's endpoint (e.g., malware).
- Exfiltration of cookies through other methods (unspecified).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  Requires persistent access to an endpoint where the VPN application is used OR the ability to exfiltrate the cookies via other methods.
-  The attacker must be able to access the stored cookies (either in memory or log files)

**Affected Products (as specifically called out):**
-  Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect Agent 4.1.0 for Windows and 4.1.10 and earlier for macOS
-  Pulse Desktop Client 9.0R2 and earlier and 5.3R6 and earlier
-  Pulse Connect Secure (for Network Connect customers) 9.0R2 and earlier, 8.3R6 and earlier, and 8.1R13 and earlier
-  Cisco AnyConnect 4.7.x and prior
-  F5 Networks products (insecure memory storage since 2013, insecure log storage fixed in versions 12.1.3 and 13.1.0 and onwards).

**Note:** This content references **CVE-2019-1573** and **CVE-2019-11213**, but does not include details about **CVE-2016-8201**. Based on the content, there's a mention in the vendor statement of Pulse Secure, that states that `CVE-2016-8201 has been applied to this vulnerability.`, this implies that **CVE-2016-8201** was the original CVE identifier for this issue. 

**Conclusion:**
Since the primary focus of the provided information is on the insecure storage of session cookies, and the specific details reference vulnerabilities identified by CVE-2019-1573 and CVE-2019-11213 instead of CVE-2016-8201, the information cannot be used to analyze CVE-2016-8201 directly.
