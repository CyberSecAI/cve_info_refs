The provided content is related to CVE-2016-8388.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write caused by a missing check when handling font glyph data in a malformed PDF file. Specifically, the application trusts an index within a font object when writing the font's name to an array, which is not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based arbitrary write: An attacker can write a pointer to a string at an arbitrary location in memory.
- Lack of bounds checking: The application does not validate the provided index before using it to access memory, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- Signedness issue: A signedness issue in the code leads to an attacker-controlled index not being properly validated.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code Execution: By writing to arbitrary memory locations, an attacker can overwrite data, potentially gaining control of the program execution flow, leading to code execution under the context of the application.
- Memory corruption: The out-of-bounds write can cause memory corruption which could crash the application or have further undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted PDF file containing a malformed font object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PDF file to the vulnerable application (Iceni Argus).
- No specific privileges are needed beyond the ability to have the application parse the malicious PDF file.
