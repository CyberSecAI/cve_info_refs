Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-8377

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The PLC WinProladder application fails to properly validate the length of input received from a connecting client before copying it to a stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The core weakness is the lack of bounds checking when receiving data over the network. The application copies the received data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without verifying the input's length.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The application doesn't sanitize or validate the size of the input, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack, including the Structured Exception Handler (SEH), enabling them to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, potentially granting the attacker control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Connection:** The vulnerability is triggered when a client connects to a listening server (the PLC WinProladder application) and sends a specially crafted payload.
- **Malicious Server:** The vulnerability occurs when the software connects to a malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the server running the vulnerable PLC WinProladder application.
- **Low Skill:** The advisory indicates that an attacker with low skill could successfully exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the Protocol:** The attacker must be able to craft a specific network packet that triggers the buffer overflow and SEH overwrite.
- **Payload Crafting:** The attacker would need to create a payload that achieves the desired outcome, typically remote code execution.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Software:** FATEK Automation PLC WinProladder Version 3.11 Build 14701.
- **Vendor Response:** Fatek Automation did not provide an update to mitigate the vulnerability.
- **Metasploit Module:** A Metasploit module exists to exploit this vulnerability.
- **CVSS Score:** A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been assigned (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to compromise a system running vulnerable software by sending a malicious network packet causing a buffer overflow, and gaining the ability to execute code on the system.
