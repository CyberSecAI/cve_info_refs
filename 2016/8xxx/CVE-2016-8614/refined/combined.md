##### ISSUE TYPE

* Bugfix Pull Request

##### COMPONENT NAME

apt\_key.py

##### ANSIBLE VERSION

```
devel 2.2

```
##### SUMMARY

My previous fix to apt\_key reversed the order of return values and therefore compared the wrong length of ids. This PR fixes that.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks for testing [@ypid](https://github.com/ypid)! Sorry that I broke it immediately after fixing it before.  If you want to work on tests for apt\_key, we have both integration and unit tests for modules. The integration tests are just ansible roles and live here: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/test/integration/targets> You can look at how the apt tests are set up for ideas on how to setup the apt\_key tests.  unittests live here: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/test/units/modules/core> I've mostly used those for very algorithmic code. (The function that splits up key\_id into 8, 16, and everything segments would be something easily tested via the unittests). |

## Description

[![@ypid](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1301158?u=3d1f390877ed3e1403e23df4fe95475dd2f578eb&v=4&size=48)](/ypid)[ypid](https://github.com/ypid)opened [on Oct 12, 2016](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/issues/5237#issue-182532160)
##### ISSUE TYPE

* Bug Report

##### COMPONENT NAME

apt\_key module

##### ANSIBLE VERSION

devel

##### CONFIGURATION

not relevant

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT

not relevant

##### SUMMARY

apt\_key module does not verify key fingerprints and imports keys based on 16 digits long id.

This is a serious problem because it is easy to generate a OpenPGP key with a desired 16 digit key IDs.

Also, hkp is unauthenticated so it it becomes trivial to offer a wrong key to a victim.

The problem is [this workaround](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/blob/683e5e4d1ad1e779d27d58af4ae7fdcda9881ab2/packaging/os/apt_key.py#L240-L250).

##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE

```
- name: Try to import key without verifying that we import the correct key
  hosts: 'dev.example.com'
  become: True

  tasks:

    - apt_key:
        id: '00000000000000000000000047AE7F72479BC94B'
        keyserver: 'hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net'

```
##### EXPECTED RESULTS

That key does not exist. No key is added.

##### ACTUAL RESULTS

The key id 479BC94B is imported.

##### EXAMPLE FIX

Enforce correct key fingerprint with a trick such as:

```
mkdir /tmp/gpg && chmod 700 /tmp/gpg
gpg --homedir /tmp/gpg --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv 479BC94B
gpg --homedir /tmp/gpg --export DDA2C105C4B73A6649AD2BBD47AE7F72479BC94B | apt-key add -

```

### @abadger **[abadger](/abadger)** commented [Oct 21, 2016](#issue-184569141)

##### ISSUE TYPE

* Bugfix Pull Request

##### COMPONENT NAME

apt\_key.py

##### ANSIBLE VERSION

```
devel stable-2.2

```
##### SUMMARY

If the user specifies long IDs, use them for all commands except for

deleting a key. Need to use short IDs there because of an upstream

apt\_key bug. Fixed in apt\_key 1.10 (fix is present in Ubuntu 16.04 but

not Ubuntu 14.0 or some Debians).

Fixes [#5237](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/issues/5237)

Also:

* Some style cleanups
* Return a nice user error message if the key was not found on the

  keyserver
* Make file and keyring parameters type='path' so envars and tilde are

  expanded

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@abadger](https://github.com/abadger) Thanks but even after the return fix it still showed ok for this task when the key is already present (the short key id only obvious):  ``` - apt_key:     # id: 'DDA2C105C4B73A6649AD2BBD47AE7F72479BC94B'     id: '00000000000000000000000047AE7F72479BC94B'   keyserver: 'hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net' ```  Can someone else also review this? cc [@jvantuyl](https://github.com/jvantuyl) |

`[Only change to short IDs for delete (](/karmab/ansible-modules-core/commit/9d847d2b2d80348051bb4b6b3a249af7b6a64a14 "Only change to short IDs for delete (#5353)

* Only change to short IDs for delete

If the user specifies long IDs, use them for all commands except for
deleting a key.  Need to use short IDs there because of an upstream
apt_key bug.  Fixed in apt_key 1.10 (fix is present in Ubuntu 16.04 but
not Ubuntu 14.0 or some Debians).

Fixes #5237

* Check that apt-key really erased the key

When erasing a key, apt-key does not understand how to process subkeys.
This update explicitly checks that the key_id is no longer present and
throws an error if it is.  It also hints at subkeys being a possible
problem in the error message and the documentation.

Fixes #5119

* Fix apt_key check mode with long ids

apt-key can be given a key id longer than 16 chars to more accurately
define what key to download.  However, we can use a maximum of 16
chars to verify whether a key is installed or not.  So we need to use
different lengths for the id depending on what we're doing with it.

Fixes #2622

Also:

* Some style cleanups
* Use get_bin_path to find the path to apt-key and then use that when
  invoking apt-key
* Return a nice user error message if the key was not found on the
  keyserver
* Make file and keyring parameters type='path' so envars and tilde are
  expanded")[ansible#5353](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/pull/5353)[)](/karmab/ansible-modules-core/commit/9d847d2b2d80348051bb4b6b3a249af7b6a64a14 "Only change to short IDs for delete (#5353)
