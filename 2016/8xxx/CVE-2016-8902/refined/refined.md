Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-8902:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `sort` parameter of the `categoriesServlet`. This parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `categoriesServlet`.
- The `sort` parameter is not sanitized, allowing arbitrary SQL code to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
- Since it is a blind SQL injection, attackers can manipulate SQL queries and extract data by observing boolean responses.
- The attacker can potentially read all data accessible to the database user, possibly including data from other databases (schemas) and tables.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `categoriesServlet` with the `sort` parameter.
- The attack can be performed remotely over HTTP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required, meaning that the attacker can be unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `categoriesServlet` with the specially crafted `sort` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is `/categoriesServlet?start=0&count=10&sort=SQLi`.
- A proof of concept payload is provided: `sort=keywords LIMIT (SELECT CASE WHEN (/*your-boolean-question-here*/) THEN 1 ELSE -1 END)--`
- The response `{"items":[],"numRows":0}` for a valid query and a blank page when the query returns false can be used to determine if a condition is true or false, allowing for data exfiltration.
