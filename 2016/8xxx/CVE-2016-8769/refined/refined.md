Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-8769

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unquoted service path in the Huawei UTPS (Unified Terminal PC Suite) software, also known as Mobile Partner. The service paths for "Photon.RunOUC" and "airtel.RunOuc" are unquoted. This means that if a malicious file is placed in a directory with a similar path name to the service binary, the system may execute that malicious file instead of the intended binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unquoted Service Path:** The core weakness is the lack of quotes around the service executable path, such as `C:\Program Files\Photon\Huawei\EC306-1\UpdateDog\ouc.exe`. This allows an attacker to insert a malicious executable with a similar or modified path to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can gain elevated (SYSTEM) privileges by placing a malicious executable in the service's path, which is then executed when the service starts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the target system.
- **Write Permissions:** The attacker must have write permissions to the directory of the service's path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable machine.
- The attacker must be able to write files to the directory where the service's executable is located.

**Additional Details:**
- The Huawei advisory states that the vulnerability is fixed in version `UTPS-V200R003B015D16SPC00C983`.
- The Exploit-DB entry provides specific service examples ("Photon. RunOuc" and "airtel. Runouc") and details how to use `sc qc` command to check the unquoted service path.
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a detailed step-by-step for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability which includes inserting an executable file in the path of the service.
