- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow in the `icnBufferAlloc` function, stemming from a signedness issue. When a negative size is passed to this function, an undersized buffer is returned from a linked list, causing a subsequent buffer overflow in `ipDataFeedRead` when it tries to populate the buffer with data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Heap-based buffer overflow.
    - Signedness issue in size calculation within `icnBufferAlloc`.
    - Inadequate size validation when allocating buffers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution under the context of the user running the tool.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted PDF file containing a malformed font is required to trigger the vulnerability. The tool will attempt to convert the PDF containing a malformed font to XML.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted PDF to be processed by the vulnerable software. The user needs to process this file using the affected tool.
