Yesterday Joomla published version 3.6.4, an update to patch security issues:

* High Priority — Core — Account Creation (affecting Joomla! 3.4.4 through 3.6.3) [More information »](https://developer.joomla.org/security-centre/659-20161001-core-account-creation.html)
* High Priority — Core — Elevated Privileges (affecting Joomla! 3.4.4 through 3.6.3) [More information »](https://developer.joomla.org/security-centre/660-20161002-core-elevated-privileges.html)

Because I was curious to see how these vulnerabilies worked I decided to check out the patch and write an exploit. By looking at [the changes](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/commit/bae1d43938c878480cfd73671e4945211538fdcf), the issue had to be in the *components/com\_users/controllers/user.php* file.

![]()

Turns out the *register* method of *UsersControllerUser* had been removed completely. Interesting. So I installed my own Joomla at version 3.6.3 and noticed that registations are usually done with the following request:

![]()

In Joomla, the *option* parameter is a reference to the Joomla component in the *components* directory, and the *task* parameter is a reference to the controller and method that has to be called. As you can see in the screenshot, a registration is processed by the *Registration* controller.

It became clear to me that the *Registration* controller could be bypassed by calling the removed *register* method of the *User* controller, so I switched off Allow User Registration and modified the request.

Because the [method expects](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/commit/bae1d43938c878480cfd73671e4945211538fdcf#diff-f820ef502f338b5be5a00aac838e756fL301) an array of *user,* I substituted *jform* with *user* in the request. Finally I modified the *task* parameter by changing *registration.register* into *user.register*. This is the final request:

![]()

When I went back to the Admin console I found a registered user there ☺︎

![]()

For **Elevated Privileges**, the newly created user can be added to a group of choice by including a *user[groups][]* parameter in the request. The default group ID of the Administrators group is 7.

So by combining these two vulnerabilities it is possible to create an Administrator user without any prior authentication. After that, you can upload a shell as an extension and get code excecution on the server 🎉

# **Final notes**

* For the request to work it needs to include a valid cookie and security token. You can grab a token from the login form. The security token can be weird and doesn’t always work. I’m still trying to find out how to reliably grab a working one.
* The final request is available here: <https://gist.github.com/melvinsh/4b28f78ace12ec0c02b183bbadc76da8>.

# Joomla Exploits in the Wild Against CVE-2016-8870 and CVE-2016-8869

  [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df3ec5506ba59d2ed3b951b7057e97d0?s=60&d=mm&r=g)](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)   [Daniel Cid](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)

* October 28, 2016
 ![](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10282016_EN_joomla-exploits-in-the-wild-against-cve-2016-8870-and-cve-2016-8869_blog.jpg)

Exactly 3 days ago, the Joomla team [issued a patch](https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/10/joomla-account-creation-vulnerability.html) for a high-severity vulnerability that allows remote users to create accounts and increase their privileges on any Joomla site. Both issues combined give the attackers enough power to easily upload backdoor files and get complete control of the vulnerable site.

A few hours after the patch was released, we were able to reverse-engineer it. We created an internal-only tool that allowed us to exploit the vulnerability and upload a backdoor. [Marc explained](https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/10/details-on-the-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-joomla.html) the technical details in yesterday’s post. His research allowed us to understand how attackers could potentially abuse the vulnerability and what we would need to do to [update the virtual patching rules in our cloud Firewall](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/) to keep our customers protected.

However, we were not the only ones performing this research. Less than **24 hrs** after the initial disclosure, we started to see tests and small pings on some of our honeypots trying to verify if this vulnerability was present.

In less than **36 hrs** after the initial disclosure, we started to see mass exploit attempts across the web. In fact, because of the sharp increase, it’s our belief that any **Joomla! site that has not been updated is most likely already compromised.**

## Phase 1: Initial Pokes

The first attacks started at around **1pm UTC on the 26th**, less than 24 hrs after the initial disclosure by the Joomla team. Most of them were looking for the user.register tasks and trying to create users. They were especially targeting some of the most popular Joomla sites.

This is how the payload would look in your web logs:

```
POST /index.php?option=com_users&task=user.register HTTP/1.1"
```
## Phase 2: First Mass Exploits

A few hours later, at around 8pm UTC, a couple of IPs from Romania started a mass attack against thousands of different Joomla sites. In all of them, they tried to create a username called **db\_cfg** with the password **fsugmze3**. They were going to the same URL with a payload that looks like:

```
82.77.15.204 - - [26/Oct/2016:18:09:24 -0400]
"POST /index.php/component/users/?task=user.register
 user[name] = db_cfg
 user[username] = db_cfg
 user[password1] = fsugmze3
 user[password2] = fsugmze3
```

If your site was not updated in time, look for the **db\_cfg** username on your site as you are likely to have been hacked already. You can also **look for these 3 IP addresses** in your log:

```
 82.76.195.141
 82.77.15.204
 81.196.107.174
```

They were the ones doing this initial mass exploitation campaign. Shortly after, another IP address from Latvia started a similar mass exploit campaign trying to register random usernames and passwords on thousands of Joomla sites. The only similar pattern for this Latvia IP address was the email: **ringcoslio1981@gmail.com**.

So we have **another IP to look for** in your logs:

```
185.129.148.216
```

Both campaigns kept running strong through the 26th and 27th attempting to compromise every Joomla site we were watching, including our Honeypots.

## Phase 3: Public Knowledge

After these initial mass exploits, multiple researchers and security professionals started to share different exploits for this attack. Some of them are even automating the upload of backdoors and using some unique techniques to bypass the media uploader (using .**pht** files).

That led to a massive increase in IP addresses trying to exploit this vulnerability using different patterns and techniques.

This is the graph of exploit attempts against this vulnerability since the disclosure:

[![Rate of Joomla infections since vulnerability disclosure](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joomla-exploits-mass-infection-vulnerability-650x469.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joomla-exploits-mass-infection-vulnerability.jpg)

Rate of Joomla infections since vulnerability disclosure.

… And that’s just based on the number of sites for which we have visibility.

## Likely Already Compromised

If you have not updated your Joomla site yet, you are likely already compromised. Every Joomla site on our network was hit (and blocked by the [Sucuri Firewall](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/stop-website-attacks-and-hacks)) and I assume pretty much every site out there suffered the same way.

I still recommend updating your site ASAP and checking for any new users in your dashboard. Also look for the provided IP addresses in your logs, along with the **task=user.register** pattern. If you find yourself in a situation where you have been compromised we have a new guide on [how to clean a hacked Joomla site](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-clean-hacked-joomla) that you can follow. If you are unable to do it yourself [we can help with the incident response](https://sucuri.net/website-antivirus/malware-removal).

   Thank you Daniel…
    With your help, here’s the command I’ve used to look for attempts in a centos cpanel environment.

   This IP 185.129.148.216 created an account in our system at [27/Oct/2016:04:23:50 +0200].
    Luckily it (ringcoslio1981@gmail.com) wasn’t enabled/activated and the user never logged in.
    Our system doesn’t seem compromised. No newer files were found on the server. I checked that before we updated to 3.6.4.

   I would like to know if we were lucky because our admin folders are password protected by htaccess?
    Or was it just stupidity of the hacker 185.129.148.216?

   BTW: This IP still tries something. I don’t understand what. I just notice lots of new log-entries trying something in the admin folder and always getting a “client denied by server configuration”.

   Can’t nobody do something against this IP?
    Thnks

      Base on my test,if you don’t allow user registration,the account will not be enabled and activated.
       But if you allow,the account will be enabled and activated.

          Thank you.
          Your tests were correct:-)
          User registration was not allowed!

      Seems like they are looking for backdoors on your site. They all returned 404’s, so you are good in that regard.

         Thank you.
          Do you mean backdoors that they believe have left behind?
          I understand. These are automatic processes which have no memory and don’t know that the user login failed.
          Do you think it’s more than one person behind 185.129.148.216?
          Probably I should not take this too personally.

# Joomla Account Creation and Privilege Escalation

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### Joomla Account Creation and Privilege Escalation

Disclosed
10/25/2016

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module creates an arbitrary account with administrative privileges in Joomla versions 3.4.4
through 3.6.3. If an email server is configured in Joomla, an email will be sent to activate the account (the account is disabled by default).

#### Author(s)

* Fabio Pires <fp@integrity.pt>
* Filipe Reis <fr@integrity.pt>
* Vitor Oliveira <vo@integrity.pt>

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/auxiliary/admin/http/joomla_registration_privesc.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/auxiliary/admin/http/joomla_registration_privesc.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use auxiliary/admin/http/joomla_registration_privesc
msf auxiliary(joomla_registration_privesc) > show actions
    ...actions...
msf auxiliary(joomla_registration_privesc) > set ACTION < action-name >
msf auxiliary(joomla_registration_privesc) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf auxiliary(joomla_registration_privesc) > run
```

### Metasploit

Penetration testing software for offensive security teams.

Key Features

* [Collect and share all the information you need to conduct a successful and efficient penetration test](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Simulate complex attacks against your systems and users](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Test your defenses to make sure they’re ready](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Automate Every Step of Your Penetration Test](/products/metasploit/features)

[Free Metasploit Pro Trial](/try/metasploit-pro/)
[View All Features](/products/metasploit/features/)

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

– Jim O’Gorman | President, Offensive Security

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Xiphos Research Ltd](/?author=7863)

#### Type:

###### [webapps](/?type=webapps)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://github.com/XiphosResearch/exploits/tree/master/Joomraa

While analysing the recent Joomla exploit in com_users:user.register we came across a problem with the upload whitelisting. They don't allow files containing <?php, or with the extensions .php and .phtml, but they do allow <?= and .pht files, which works out of the box on most hosting environments, including the standard Ubuntu LAMP install, as per:

<FilesMatch ".+\.ph(p[345]?|t|tml)$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
Usage

Choose the username, password and e-mail address to use and point it at the URL for your Joomla website. Use the -x and -s options to customise exploit behaviour, -s searches for the given string in the output after running the PHP file (specified in -x), an example is provided which proves remote code execution.

$ ./joomraa.py -u hacker -p password -e hacker@example.com http://localhost:8080/joomla

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Details on the Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Joomla

  [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8612a64e0ed5b9e586b548a984073120?s=60&d=mm&r=g)](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/marc)   [Marc-Alexandre Montpas](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/marc)

* October 26, 2016
 ![](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10262016_EN_details-on-the-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-joomla_blog.jpg)

Yesterday, [Joomla! 3.6.4 was released](https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5678-joomla-3-6-4-released.html), patching a critical privilege escalation and arbitrary account creation vulnerability.

As we’ve seen some exploits attempts occurring in the wild, we feel it is a good time to describe what the issue is and how it was fixed.

## Analyzing the Patch

It was fairly easy to figure out where the vulnerable code was, as pretty much all the patch does (with the exception of [fixing an additional two factor authentication bug](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/12497)) is basically remove the **register** method from the **UsersControllerUser** class. So that’s where our investigation started.

[![Joomla register method removed in privilege escalation vulnerability code snippet](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joomla-vulnerabiity-register-method.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joomla-vulnerabiity-register-method.png)

We removed some original code for improved readability

All in all, what this method does is it takes user input from the **user** POST parameter (which is intended to be an associative array) and validates whether specific parameters are properly formatted (email address, username, etc.). If it’s all good, it pushes the array to the **register** method from the **UsersModelRegistration** class.

## Step #1 – Creating an Account

At this point, one question popped in our mind: *“Why would they remove that method? Won’t that break sites that allows users to register an account?”*

We quickly discovered that Joomla uses another controller class for registering users, **UsersControllerRegistration**, which **also has a register method**:

[![Joomla privilege escalation vulnerability snippet register method lacks checks](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joomla-vulnerabiity-account-create-650x558.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joomla-vulnerabiity-account-create.png)

While the two look very similar, they present two very important differences:

1. The script first **checks if user registrations are enabled**, something the other register method didn’t do. As the two methods are publicly accessible, **it allows users to create accounts** even if the option supposed to restrict this possibility is disabled.
2. This method uses what returns from **UsersModelRegistration**‘s **validate** method to register the user. The former **register** method barely used this **to validate if the data was successfully processed**.

This very subtle difference is what caused the privilege escalation vulnerability to be possible.

## Step #2 – Getting Higher Privileges

At this point, you might ask yourself why this seemingly innocent difference is causing such mayhem. The answer is pretty simple to understand when we take a look at what the **validate** method does internally.

[![Joomla privilege escalation vulnerability passes user input](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joomla-vulnerabiity-privilege-1-628x650.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joomla-vulnerabiity-privilege-1.png)

Essentially, it passes the user input **$data** into the **$form** filter method, which has pretty much the same effect as [PHP’s array\_intersect\_key function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-intersect-key.php): it only keeps the parameters located in **$data** if they are also in the **$form** variable. This way, they can limit what’s being sent to their model classes. After processing the array, it checks if all of the values are properly formatted and then returns the modified **$data** array.

See where we are going with this? If you read step #1 carefully, you’ll remember that the vulnerable **register** method didn’t use **validate**‘s return to register the user.

What this means is that **any additional parameters** we send will **go through the model’s user registration code unsanitized**.

[![Joomla privilege escalation vulnerability unsanitized code passed](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joomla-vulnerabiity-privilege-2-650x585.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joomla-vulnerabiity-privilege-2.png)

Joomla privilege escalation vulnerability unsanitized code passed

When looking at **$model’**s **register** method (located in the **UsersModelRegistration** class), we see that the data we send gets submitted to **JUser**‘s **bind** method – before saving the **$user** instance to the database.

The **bind** method basically takes every **$key => $value** pairs from our **$data** array and sets the corresponding **$user** instance property **$key** with its **$value.** This means that an attacker can override any properties present in the JUser class- which will be saved in the database not long after that as a new user.

So what property would we want to override? Good candidates would be any these (or a combination of them):

* the **$groups** property, which contains an array with the numeric ID of the groups the user belongs to (such groups are managers, authors, and administrators)
* the **$id property**, which contains the ID of the user we want to save (remember, we’re dealing with the **JUser** class here – **which doesn’t know if we’re registering or updating a user**)

## From Arbitrary Account Creation to Remote Code Execution

Using all of these factors combined, we managed to craft an internal exploit to test our WAF that **not only allows us to create an account** even when account registration is disabled, **but also changes the administrator’s username, password, and email address!**

As administrators can install extension packages on their site, an attacker could use his freshly hacked administrator account to upload a remote shell on the site and further compromise the server.

## Update As Soon As Possible!

To keep your site safe, you should update it as soon as possible. We’re seeing exploitation attempts in the wild so it’s only a matter of time until an exploit becomes public.

As we mentioned in our initial post, websites behind the [Sucuri Firewal](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/)l are automatically protected through our virtual patching technology.

   There are already exploit tries in the wild…

      Yes, that’s why we shared. Since the cat is out of the bag already, we might as well help the defenders understand how it work to get it patched/blocked.

         Your post is truly informative on the flaw itself. Maybe the key to success(in prevention) is more about “how to get to the user.register()” function, rather than “how the exploit works”.

         I understand that you don’t want to share this(at this point) , but I am grateful (and maybe all of us) for what you have already shared – good job !

      Yes, we are seeing some mass exploits in the wild already. They try to add the username “db\_cfg” to the site.

   You mention the `array\_filter()` function above. From your description, I suspect you mean `array\_intersect\_key()`.

      You’re right! Not sure why I linked array\_filter in there, anyway. Thanks for pointing that out!

   Thank you for your post! I’m trying to reproduce your internal exploit using the modification of a Super User account, in order to install an extension package. I can change the account’s password and email, but it then requires activation. When I receive the email to active the account, the activation link failed with: Registration failed: Failed to save activation data: User not Super Administrator.
    How did you manage to bypass this, knowing we can’t replace “block” and “activation” variable in database? Thank you!

   Ok I found the solution 🙂
