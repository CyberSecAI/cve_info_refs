Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-8644:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect capability check when viewing course notes. The system was not verifying the user's permissions within the correct context (the course), but rather using a broader, site-wide permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Context Check:** The `has_capability` check for viewing notes was not performed in the specific context of the course where the notes belonged. This allowed users with site-wide permissions, even if those permissions had been revoked within a particular course, to view course notes they should not have access to.
- **Bypass of Course-Specific Permissions:**  The system bypassed the intended course-specific permission settings for note viewing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Users could potentially view course notes they weren't meant to see, violating the intended privacy and access control of those notes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a user with site-wide permissions (that may or may not have been revoked in a specific course) accessing the course notes functionality of Moodle.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user who has site-wide permissions that could be revoked in a specific course. This means they likely have higher-level permissions than a standard course user. They also need to have access to the course notes functionality within the Moodle instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The severity of the issue is rated as "Minor."
- The vulnerability affected Moodle versions 3.1 to 3.1.2, 3.0 to 3.0.6, 2.9 to 2.9.8, 2.8 to 2.8.12, 2.7 to 2.7.16 and earlier unsupported versions.
- It was fixed in versions 3.1.3, 3.0.7, 2.9.9, and 2.7.17.
- The issue was reported by Andrew Nicols.
- The Moodle Tracker issue number is MDL-51347.
