Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-8676:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `get_vlc2` function within `get_bits.h`. This occurs when a crafted media file is processed by libav, leading to an attempt to access memory at a null address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the code attempts to dereference a null pointer, resulting in a crash. This occurs specifically during the execution of the `get_vlc2` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the application (e.g., `avconv`) that is processing the malformed media file. This can lead to denial of service as the application terminates unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Media File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted media file. The attacker would need to provide this file to an application using the vulnerable libav library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious media file to an application that uses the vulnerable libav library (versions 11.3 to 11.7). This can be achieved if the user opens the attacker's crafted file.
- The attacker does not need to be local to the target, a remote user could trigger this.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The issue was mitigated by commit `9d69dcc042142a93b0a61a2a41854e84a4c26b42`, affecting `libavformat/m4vdec.c`.
- Although a specific commit (`e5b019725f53b79159931d3a7317107cbbfd0860`) made the original test case non-exploitable, the underlying issue was still present.
- The vulnerability does not affect ffmpeg.
- The vulnerability was present in libav versions 11.3 to 11.7 and fixed in version 11.9
