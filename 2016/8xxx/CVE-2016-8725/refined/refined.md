- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web application of the Moxa AWK-3131A wireless access point allows unauthenticated access to the `systemlog.log` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to lack of authentication on the specified URL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive system information by accessing the log file.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send an HTTP request to the vulnerable URL (e.g., `/systemlog.log`) without any authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device. No authentication is needed.
