- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of input validation in Huawei FusionAccess.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability, specifically LDAP injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain sensitive information from the database.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker with specific permissions can inject LDAP operation commands into a specific input variable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have specific permissions within the FusionAccess system and needs to be able to log in to the system.
