Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8339:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `CONFIG SET` command when handling the `client-output-buffer-limit` option in Redis. Specifically, the code accesses the `server.client_obuf_limits` array using a client class index, which can exceed the array's bounds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The `client_obuf_limits` array, which has a size of 3 (indexed from 0 to 2), is accessed using the client class type. The code allows a client type of "master" to be set, which has an ID of 3. This causes the program to write to an index outside of the array bounds.
- **Incorrect Client Class Handling:** The `CONFIG SET` command allows the "master" client class to be specified for `client-output-buffer-limit`, which should not have been allowed, as this class is only used for implementing `CLIENT KILL`. This class should not be used for `client-output-buffer-limit`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Writing outside the bounds of the `client_obuf_limits` array overwrites subsequent memory locations in the global `server` structure.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Specifically overwriting the `aof_filename` field of the server structure. This could lead to information disclosure, arbitrary file overwrite with AOF data, or the loading of a malicious AOF file to exploit other potential vulnerabilities within the AOF parser.
- **Denial of Service:** It is also possible to cause denial of service by corrupting other parts of memory used by Redis.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker needs to be able to connect to the Redis instance remotely.
- **`CONFIG SET` Command:** The attacker must be able to send the `CONFIG SET` command, which is often restricted in managed Redis instances.
- **Control over `redis.conf`:** The attacker could also achieve exploitation by having control over the "redis.conf" file and triggering a server restart.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Redis server.
- **Redis Command Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to send commands such as `CONFIG SET`.
- **Privileges:** The attacker needs privileges to execute the `CONFIG SET` command which is usually a high privilege command,
- The attacker must also know the `master` client ID.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced on July 28 2015 when the "master" client class was added.
- Redis versions 3.2.x and unstable were vulnerable, whereas 3.0.x was not.
- The fix was implemented on September 26, 2016, which prevents the use of "master" client class with `CONFIG SET client-output-buffer-limit`.
