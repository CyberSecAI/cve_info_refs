This commit fixes a vunlerability reported by Cory Duplantis
of Cisco Talos, see TALOS-2016-0206 for reference.

CONFIG SET client-output-buffer-limit accepts as client class "master"
which is actually only used to implement CLIENT KILL. The "master" class
has ID 3. What happens is that the global structure:

    server.client_obuf_limits[class]

Is accessed with class = 3. However it is a 3 elements array, so writing
the 4th element means to write up to 24 bytes of memory *after* the end
of the array, since the structure is defined as:

    typedef struct clientBufferLimitsConfig {
        unsigned long long hard_limit_bytes;
        unsigned long long soft_limit_bytes;
        time_t soft_limit_seconds;
    } clientBufferLimitsConfig;

EVALUATION OF IMPACT:

Checking what's past the boundaries of the array in the global
'server' structure, we find AOF state fields:

    clientBufferLimitsConfig client_obuf_limits[CLIENT_TYPE_OBUF_COUNT];
    /* AOF persistence */
    int aof_state;                  /* AOF_(ON|OFF|WAIT_REWRITE) */
    int aof_fsync;                  /* Kind of fsync() policy */
    char *aof_filename;             /* Name of the AOF file */
    int aof_no_fsync_on_rewrite;    /* Don't fsync if a rewrite is in prog. */
    int aof_rewrite_perc;           /* Rewrite AOF if % growth is > M and... */
    off_t aof_rewrite_min_size;     /* the AOF file is at least N bytes. */
    off_t aof_rewrite_base_size;    /* AOF size on latest startup or rewrite. */
    off_t aof_current_size;         /* AOF current size. */

Writing to most of these fields should be harmless and only cause problems in
Redis persistence that should not escalate to security problems.
However unfortunately writing to "aof_filename" could be potentially a
security issue depending on the access pattern.

Searching for "aof.filename" accesses in the source code returns many different
usages of the field, including using it as input for open(), logging to the
Redis log file or syslog, and calling the rename() syscall.

It looks possible that attacks could lead at least to informations
disclosure of the state and data inside Redis. However note that the
attacker must already have access to the server. But, worse than that,
it looks possible that being able to change the AOF filename can be used
to mount more powerful attacks: like overwriting random files with AOF
data (easily a potential security issue as demostrated here:
<http://antirez.com/news/96>), or even more subtle attacks where the
AOF filename is changed to a path were a malicious AOF file is loaded
in order to exploit other potential issues when the AOF parser is fed
with untrusted input (no known issue known currently).

The fix checks the places where the 'master' class is specifiedf in
order to access configuration data structures, and return an error in
this cases.

WHO IS AT RISK?

The "master" client class was introduced in Redis in Jul 28 2015.
Every Redis instance released past this date is not vulnerable
while all the releases after this date are. Notably:

    Redis 3.0.x is NOT vunlerable.
    Redis 3.2.x IS vulnerable.
    Redis unstable is vulnerable.

In order for the instance to be at risk, at least one of the following
conditions must be true:

    1. The attacker can access Redis remotely and is able to send
       the CONFIG SET command (often banned in managed Redis instances).

    2. The attacker is able to control the "redis.conf" file and
       can wait or trigger a server restart.

The problem was fixed 26th September 2016 in all the releases affected.

# Redis: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201702-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Redis, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/redis** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.5**>= **3.0.7** |

### Background

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store,
used as a database, cache and message broker.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Redis. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, able to connect to a Redis instance, could issue
malicious commands possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Redis 3.0.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/redis-3.0.7"

```

All Redis 3.2.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/redis-3.2.5"

```

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0206

## Redis CONFIG SET client-output-buffer-limit command Code Execution Vulnerability

##### September 30, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-8339

### Summary

An out of bounds write vulnerability exists in the handling of the client-output-buffer-limit option during the CONFIG SET command for the Redis data structure store. A crafted CONFIG SET command can lead to an out of bounds write potentially resulting in code execution.

### Tested Versions

Redis - 3.2.3

### Product URLs

http://redis.io/

### CVSSv3 Score

6.6 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Details

Redis is a simple in-memory data structure store using a key-value model. Redis has been growing in popularity due to its ability to handle problems that other databases can’t solve or are inherently slow at.

An out of bounds write vulnerability exists during the modification of the `client-output-buffer-limit` option using the `CONFIG SET` command. The required syntax for setting the `client-output-buffer-limit` option is shown below.

```
CONFIG SET client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>

```

This option sets the limits for disconnecting clients of a certain class. This option is set using the following code:

```
src/config.c
849    /* Finally set the new config */
850    for (j = 0; j < vlen; j += 4) {
851        int class;
852        unsigned long long hard, soft;
853        int soft_seconds;
854
855        class = getClientTypeByName(v[j]);
856        hard = strtoll(v[j+1],NULL,10);
857        soft = strtoll(v[j+2],NULL,10);
858        soft_seconds = strtoll(v[j+3],NULL,10);
859
860        server.client_obuf_limits[class].hard_limit_bytes = hard;
861        server.client_obuf_limits[class].soft_limit_bytes = soft;
862        server.client_obuf_limits[class].soft_limit_seconds = soft_seconds;
863    }

src/networking.c
1747    int getClientTypeByName(char *name) {
1748        if (!strcasecmp(name,"normal")) return CLIENT_TYPE_NORMAL;      // 0
1749        else if (!strcasecmp(name,"slave")) return CLIENT_TYPE_SLAVE;   // 1
1750        else if (!strcasecmp(name,"pubsub")) return CLIENT_TYPE_PUBSUB; // 2
1751        else if (!strcasecmp(name,"master")) return CLIENT_TYPE_MASTER; // 3
1752        else return -1;
1753    }

```

In the parsing of `client-output-buffer-limit` a call to `getClientTypeByName` is used to retrieve the corresponding class’s type. In this case, `getClientTypeByName` returns a value in the set of [-1, 3]. Looking at the declaration of the `client_obuf_limits` array, we see that the size of the array is `3`.

```
src/server.h

704    struct redisServer {
...
796    clientBufferLimitsConfig client_obuf_limits[CLIENT_TYPE_OBUF_COUNT];
...
980    }

src/server.h
292    #define CLIENT_TYPE_OBUF_COUNT 3 /* Number of clients to expose to output

```

Although `client-output-buffer-limit` is only expecting clients of types `normal`, `slave`, and `pubsub`, `master` is
also a valid client. By providing a client type of `master`, the `client_obuf_limit` array is overflown and subsequent
structure variables are overwritten.

A sample command exercising this vulnerability is below:

```
CONFIG SET client-output-buffer-limit "master 3735928559 3405691582 373529054"

```
