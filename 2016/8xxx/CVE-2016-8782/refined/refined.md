- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of specific fields in Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) packets. This lack of proper validation leads to the LDP processing module not releasing allocated memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can cause a memory leak by repeatedly sending specifically crafted LDP packets, potentially leading to service disruption.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specific LDP packets repeatedly to vulnerable devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
