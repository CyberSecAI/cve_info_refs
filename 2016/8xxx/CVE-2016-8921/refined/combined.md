# Security Bulletin: FileNet Workplace XT can be affected by the File Extension validation vulnerability (CVE-2016-8921)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

FileNet Workplace XT is vulnerable to the File Extension validation bypass which allows malicious content to be uploaded to the FileNet P8 server

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-8921](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8921) IBM FileNet Workplace XT could allow a remote attacker to upload arbitrary files, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.

CVSS Base Score: 6.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118531> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

## Affected Products and Versions

FileNet Workplace XT 1.1.5

## Remediation/Fixes

Refer to the Workarounds and Mitigations section.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

There are 2 different ways to address this vulnerability. Either can be implemented separately or they can be used together.

1) Check and remove malicious content before it gets added in to the P8 repository (address on the front end).

2) Check for malicious content when content is being viewed and do not allow it to be accessed (address on the back end).

To avoid malicious content from being uploaded in to the P8 repository:

(1) Create a custom event action that's triggered on an AddDocument event that checks either the file type being added or calls a file scanner to validate the contents before the content is added.

(2) Configure a file scanner to scan the storage volume where content is being saved and have it send an alert when it finds malicious content.

To prevent content that contains JavaScript code from being executed when it is viewed by Workplace XT:

(1) Force JavaScript files to be viewed as text. A Workplace XT response filter could be implemented to change the MIME Type from JavaScript to Text.

(2) Configure your browser to not execute JavaScript files.

The above suggested implementations are examples of various ways to prevent malicious content from being either uploaded and/or executed. Please contact IBM Support for additional information.
