- **Root cause of vulnerability**: File Extension validation bypass vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The application fails to properly validate file extensions during the upload process, allowing an attacker to upload files with malicious content.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to upload arbitrary files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker uploads a file with a malicious file extension.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the FileNet Workplace XT server. This is achievable with low privileges (PR:L).
