Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-8684:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content includes multiple references to CVE-2016-8684, confirming its relevance. 
   - The description of the vulnerability aligns with the official CVE description mentioning "memory allocation failure" and "file truncation error for corrupt file" in `MagickMalloc` function inside of `magick/memory.c` triggered by a crafted image in GraphicsMagick.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause of the vulnerability lies in insufficient checks or handling of image file headers, particularly in the SGI image coder (`coders/sgi.c`). The code allocates memory based on header values, but does not compare them against actual file size, leading to allocation of an excessive amount of memory, which causes a memory allocation failure and a file truncation error.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Out-of-bounds memory allocation**: The core vulnerability is the lack of validation between header information of a file and the file size. This can be triggered by specially crafted SGI images which make the application request a very large memory allocation.
   - **Lack of file size validation:** The code doesn't verify if the file size is reasonable in comparison to the header information.
   - **Resource exhaustion**: Due to the excessive memory allocation, an attacker can cause a memory allocation failure and eventually crash of the application leading to denial of service (DoS)

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of successful exploitation is a denial-of-service condition. The program attempts to allocate a large amount of memory which leads to a resource exhaustion condition and eventual crash.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Crafted SGI Image:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted SGI image file to the GraphicsMagick.
   - **Network:** The attacker could exploit the vulnerability remotely, by sending a crafted image that gets processed by an application using GraphicsMagick.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SGI image file to the vulnerable GraphicsMagick application for processing.
   - **No special privileges**: No special privileges or authentication are needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions:**
  - The `ReadSGIImage` function in `coders/sgi.c` processes the header of the SGI image and allocates memory according to dimensions found within it. The vulnerability exists because the function does not properly validate the header values against the actual file size and an attacker can craft an image that contains header values which causes a very large memory allocation request that the system cannot fulfill.
  - The fix involves sanity checking that the file size is reasonable given the header information, preventing excessive memory allocation.

**Summary of information extracted:**
- **Root cause:** Insufficient validation of SGI file header values, leading to excessive memory allocation.
- **Weakness:** Lack of proper size validation before memory allocation.
- **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) via excessive resource use.
- **Attack vector:** Crafted SGI image file.
- **Attacker capabilities:**  Ability to provide a specially crafted image file.
