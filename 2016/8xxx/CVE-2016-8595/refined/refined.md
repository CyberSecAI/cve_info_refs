Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `gsm_parse` function in `libavcodec/gsm_parser.c`.
- The code includes an `av_assert0(0)` statement within a `default` case of a `switch` statement. This assert triggers when a specific condition isn't met during the parsing of the GSM audio stream.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- An unhandled condition in the GSM audio stream parsing leads to the assertion failure. The `default` case indicates that some input is not handled correctly.
- The `av_assert0(0)` is a deliberate trigger for an abort, indicating an unexpected or invalid state during parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the ffmpeg program due to the assertion failure. This leads to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input file (`input.avi`) that contains a GSM audio stream that triggers the unhandled default case within the `gsm_parse` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted media file (`input.avi`) to an ffmpeg instance for processing.

**Technical Details**
* The crash occurs in `libavcodec/gsm_parser.c` at line 59: `av_assert0(0);`
* The vulnerable code is reached by providing an input `.avi` file with a `dvaudio` audio codec.
* The issue arises when parsing the GSM audio stream, indicating a potential format error or lack of handling in the GSM parser code

**Summary:**

The provided information describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in ffmpeg 3.1.4. A specially crafted `input.avi` file containing a problematic GSM audio stream triggers an assertion failure within the `gsm_parser.c` file leading to a crash. This can be used by an attacker to cause a denial of service by providing a malicious file to ffmpeg.
