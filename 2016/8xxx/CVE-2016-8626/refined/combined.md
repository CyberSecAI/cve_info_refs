| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c0)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-10-27 07:25:06 UTC  ``` Description:  A Flaw was found using which authenticated attacker can send post object with null conditions to ceph rados gateway which would lead to crash of ceph-radosgw service resulting in Denial of Service.  <http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/17635> [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1387332](show_bug.cgi?id=1387332 "CLOSED ERRATA - [rhcs-2.y] rgw: crash when client post object with null conditions")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c1)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-10-27 07:26:22 UTC  ``` Workaround:  1. By default system will use /etc/init.d/ceph-radosgw    stop this service by  ~]# /etc/init.d/ceph-radosgw stop  2. Create systemd service, change command line params according to the environment where Ceph radosgw is running.  ~]# cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/ceph-rgw.service  [Unit] Description=Ceph RGW daemon  [Service] Type=forking ExecStart=/bin/radosgw -n client.rgw.$(HOSTNAME REDACTED) Restart=on-abnormal RestartSec=1s  [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target  3. Run systemd service 'ceph-rgw.service'  Caveat: It still takes +1-2 sec to get service back online. Attacker has to know bucket-name and for that attacker must be authenticated so if service get a lot of such requests user/attacker can be blocked by revoking access to service.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-22 19:24:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:   Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 for Ubuntu 16.04  Via RHSA-2016:2816 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2816.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-22 19:33:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:2815 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2815.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-01 21:39:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:2847 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2847.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-01 22:04:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3 for Ubuntu 14.04  Via RHSA-2016:2848 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2848.html>   ``` |  |

# RHSA-2016:2848 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3 security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3. This erratum is applicable for Red Hat Ceph Storage that runs on Ubuntu 14.04.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a Ceph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way Ceph Object Gateway handles POST object requests. An authenticated attacker could launch a denial of service attack by sending null or specially crafted POST object requests. (CVE-2016-8626)

Bug Fix(es):

* Dynamic Large Objects (DLOs) containing zero-length segments could cause the GET requests to enter an infinite loop or to fail depending on the position of the zero-length segment in an object, causing Ceph Object Gateway nodes to consume 100% of CPU. This bug has been fixed, and the GET requests succeed as expected in described situation. (BZ#1380196)

Enhancement(s):

* This update adds the "apply-layout-settings" command to the ceph-objectstore-tool utility. The new command enables users to perform collection splitting offline on OSD nodes in cases when doing it online would cause too large an impact. (BZ#1367441)
* With this update, it is possible to change the maximum number shards per bucket. This is especially useful when bucket sharding was not configured correctly. (BZ#1378995)

All users of Red Hat Ceph Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2847)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3. This erratum is applicable for Red Hat Ceph Storage that runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a Ceph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way Ceph Object Gateway handles POST object requests. An authenticated attacker could launch a denial of service attack by sending null or specially crafted POST object requests. (CVE-2016-8626)

Bug Fix(es):

* Dynamic Large Objects (DLOs) containing zero-length segments could cause the GET requests to enter an infinite loop or to fail depending on the position of the zero-length segment in an object, causing Ceph Object Gateway nodes to consume 100% of CPU. This bug has been fixed, and the GET requests succeed as expected in described situation. (BZ#1380196)
* After backporting certain upstream changes, an attempt to delete objects that contain underscore characters failed. The change causing this bug has been removed, and objects can now be deleted as expected. (BZ#1388647)

Enhancement(s):

* This update adds the "apply-layout-settings" command to the ceph-objectstore-tool utility. The new command enables users to perform collection splitting offline on OSD nodes in cases when doing it online would cause too large an impact. (BZ#1367441)
* With this update, it is possible to change the maximum number shards per bucket. This is especially useful when bucket sharding was not configured correctly. (BZ#1378995)

All users of Red Hat Ceph Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1380196#c0)  Justin Bautista    2016-09-28 22:17:04 UTC  ``` Description of problem:    Virtualized RGW host goes into loop causing 100% CPU utilization.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):    ceph-radosgw-0.94.5-12.el7cp.x86_64   RHEL 7.2 servers running OpenStack Kilo with Ceph Storage Backend ===========================================================================  Customer reports that after setting up 3 virtualized RGW nodes several months ago & during testing they've noticed that all 3 are running at 100% CPU (95% of the time) even though they don'think they are being heavily used. We requested RGW debug logs &  they are attached to case 01705883 as 'client.radosgw.log.gz'    The customer also provided the following details when asked for a specific timeframe to focus on:  "Between 10:10 & 10:20 AM . And it was not using ALL CPU's, but it was using more than 50% (which should have been the limit) and if we had left it alone it would have eventually used all the CPU's. Below is the partial output from sar for that timeframe ...  09:50:01 AM     all      0.07      0.00      0.04      0.00      0.00     99.89 10:00:01 AM     all      0.08      0.00      0.06      0.00      0.00     99.86 10:10:01 AM     all      0.31      0.00      0.22      0.00      0.00     99.48 10:20:01 AM     all     29.40      0.00     30.32      0.05      0.04     40.20 10:30:01 AM     all      9.51      0.00     13.63      0.01      0.01     76.84"  ====================================================================================   Log analysis of 'log entries per second' ramps up quickly starting at the 10:09:41 mark in the debug log, and appears to go into a loop around that time.   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=1380196#c36)  shilpa    2016-11-27 16:10:30 UTC  ``` Verified on ceph-radosgw-0.94.9-7   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=1380196#c41)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-01 21:39:03 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c0)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-10-27 07:25:06 UTC  ``` Description:  A Flaw was found using which authenticated attacker can send post object with null conditions to ceph rados gateway which would lead to crash of ceph-radosgw service resulting in Denial of Service.  <http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/17635> [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1387332](show_bug.cgi?id=1387332 "CLOSED ERRATA - [rhcs-2.y] rgw: crash when client post object with null conditions")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c1)  Siddharth Sharma    2016-10-27 07:26:22 UTC  ``` Workaround:  1. By default system will use /etc/init.d/ceph-radosgw    stop this service by  ~]# /etc/init.d/ceph-radosgw stop  2. Create systemd service, change command line params according to the environment where Ceph radosgw is running.  ~]# cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/ceph-rgw.service  [Unit] Description=Ceph RGW daemon  [Service] Type=forking ExecStart=/bin/radosgw -n client.rgw.$(HOSTNAME REDACTED) Restart=on-abnormal RestartSec=1s  [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target  3. Run systemd service 'ceph-rgw.service'  Caveat: It still takes +1-2 sec to get service back online. Attacker has to know bucket-name and for that attacker must be authenticated so if service get a lot of such requests user/attacker can be blocked by revoking access to service.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-22 19:24:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:   Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 for Ubuntu 16.04  Via RHSA-2016:2816 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2816.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-22 19:33:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:2815 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2815.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-01 21:39:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:2847 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2847.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1389193#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-01 22:04:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3 for Ubuntu 14.04  Via RHSA-2016:2848 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2848.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

**Description**

when i used boto3 to post object with null conditions,rgw will crash(both hammer、jewel，and master),and return http-status-code=502,so i make a patch to fix this problem!

test\_script.py

```

import boto3
from botocore.client import Config
import requests

session = boto3.session.Session()
s3client = session.client('s3', use_ssl=False,
endpoint_url='http://s3.x.abc.com',
aws_access_key_id='',
aws_secret_access_key='',
config=Config(s3={'addressing_style': 'virtual'}))

post = s3client.generate_presigned_post(
Bucket='cn-demo1',
Key='testsign',
Fields={ # "acl": "public_read", # "Content-Type": "text/plain",
},
Conditions=[ # { # "acl": "public_read", # "Content-Type": "text/plain", # }
]
)

files = {"file": '/tmp/testsign'}
response = requests.post(post["url"], post['fields'], files=files)
print response.content

```

radosgw.log

```
