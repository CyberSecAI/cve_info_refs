Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-8649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the way `lxc-attach` handles file descriptors. Specifically, `lxc-attach` was passing a file descriptor to the host's `/proc` directory to the attached process within the container. This file descriptor was used to set LSM labels, but a malicious user in the container could exploit this.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **File Descriptor Leakage:** The main issue was that the `lxc-attach` process was inadvertently providing access to the host's `/proc` filesystem through an inherited file descriptor.
*   **Ptrace Exploitation:** A malicious root user in an unprivileged container could use `ptrace` to intercept the `lxc-attach` process and prevent the file descriptor from being closed, and then manipulate it for malicious purposes.
*   **Bypass of AppArmor/SELinux Confinement:** This could lead to a bypass of AppArmor/SELinux confinement or prevent `lxc-attach` from dropping privileges correctly.
*   **Access to Host Filesystem:** By using the leaked host `/proc` file descriptor, an attacker could access the host's entire filesystem using `openat()` or related system calls

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Host File System Access:** A malicious container could gain full read/write access to the host system's filesystem.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker could bypass security restrictions, gaining elevated privileges on the host.
*   **AppArmor/SELinux Bypass:** Security profiles of the container could be bypassed, allowing unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Container:** The attacker needs a malicious process running as root within an unprivileged LXC container.
*   **`lxc-attach` Interaction:** The attack is performed by manipulating the `lxc-attach` process while it's connecting to the container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Root in Unprivileged Container:** The attacker must have root privileges inside an unprivileged container.
*  **Knowledge of `lxc-attach` process:** Ability to identify the `lxc-attach` process using tools such as `strace` and to intercept it.

**Mitigation Details**

*   **LXC Patch:** The primary mitigation involves modifying `lxc-attach` to stop passing the host's `/proc` file descriptor to the attached process, instead passing a file descriptor to either `/proc/self/attr/exec` or `/proc/self/attr/current`. A secondary process is also created to perform any needed set up prior to the main container process.
*   **Kernel Patch:** A kernel patch was developed by Eric Biederman to restrict `ptrace` operations across user namespace boundaries, preventing the ptrace manipulation attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was initially reported as a private security bug, and was later assigned the CVE-2016-8649 identifier.
*   Multiple Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, and Red Hat, released patches to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability highlighted a weakness in the interaction between containerized processes and the host system's `/proc` filesystem.
*   The fix involves a combination of both userspace and kernel patches.
*   The fix for the `lxc-attach` vulnerability included communication changes between the attach process and the child process via IPC mechanisms to setup the LSM label correctly.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entry states: "This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products."

This information provides a fairly comprehensive picture of the vulnerability, its causes, and the implemented mitigations.
