- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server does not properly validate redirect/forward, allowing for chaining with authenticated vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open redirect vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can redirect users to other potentially malicious pages.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a specially crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need prior authentication and needs to convince the victim to access a malicious link (user interaction is required).
