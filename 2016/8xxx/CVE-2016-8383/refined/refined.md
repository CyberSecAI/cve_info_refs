The provided content is related to CVE-2016-8383.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a heap corruption in the `Doc_GetFontTable` function of AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter. The size argument passed to `malloc` is read directly from the input document, and a crafted document can set it to zero. This causes subsequent out-of-bounds writes leading to heap corruption when writing font data. A similar issue can occur by supplying a very large value which can result in an integer overflow during the calculation of memory size required for allocation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, the `Doc_GetFontTable` function allocates a buffer based on a user-controlled value without sufficient size checks. Subsequent writes to this buffer overflow it.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted DOC file to the vulnerable software (AntennaHouse DMC HTMLFilter), which will trigger the heap corruption.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted document to the vulnerable software. This could be achieved through email or web based document handling system which performs DOC conversion with vulnerable software.
