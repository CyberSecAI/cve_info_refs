Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an "Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock" within the Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC-Q series Ethernet interface modules. Specifically, the affected modules are connected to a MELSEC-Q PLC, which allows a remote attacker to connect to the PLC via Port 5002/TCP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted access to Port 5002/TCP, which is used for communication with the PLC. This allows an external attacker to interact with the PLC without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The attacker can send requests via Port 5002/TCP that cause the PLC to become unresponsive, requiring a manual reset to resume normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires network access to the affected Ethernet interface module and thus the PLC. No authentication is required for the initial connection. The attacker also needs the ability to send packets to the PLC via Port 5002/TCP. A low skill level is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This document also references CVE-2016-8370, which is a separate vulnerability related to weak password encryption within the same product line. This vulnerability allows interception of weakly encrypted passwords.
- Exploits for this vulnerability are publicly available.
- Mitsubishi Electric has released a firmware update for newer devices with serial numbers 18072 and later that implements IP filtering as a mitigating control. However, they indicate that this measure does not completely prevent unauthorized access, and further measures are required.
- The advisory recommends defensive measures, such as placing the PLC behind a firewall, using IPsec to encrypt communication, and implementing a Bump-in-the-Wire (BitW) solution for enhanced security.
