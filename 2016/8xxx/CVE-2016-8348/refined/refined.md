**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Emerson Liebert SiteScan application uses a weakly configured XML parser, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code or disclosure of file contents from the server or connected network via malicious XML input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability (CWE-611) due to improper restriction of XML external entity references.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of confidential data
- Denial of service (DoS)
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located
- Other system impacts

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via malicious XML input through the application's weakly configured XML parser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any privileges, and no user interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Low skill level is required for exploitation.
- Remote network access to the vulnerable application is needed.
