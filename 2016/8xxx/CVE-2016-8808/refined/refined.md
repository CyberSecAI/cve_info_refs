Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8808:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) in the handler for DxgkDdiEscape ID 0x70000d5.
- The core issue is a missing bounds check when copying data to/from a global array. The `escape->size` value, controlled by the user, is used without validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing bounds check:** The driver fails to validate the `escape->size` value before using it as an index to access the global array, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Buffer overflow:** The lack of bounds checking can result in an overflow of the global buffer and potential pool overflows when the data is copied back to the escape data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** An attacker could trigger a crash by causing a kernel security check failure due to a stack-based buffer overrun.
- **Potential escalation of privileges:** While not explicitly stated in the exploit-db description, the NVIDIA security bulletin mentions that an attacker can potentially escalate privileges through this vulnerability.
- **Kernel Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability allows a user to write arbitrary data to kernel memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local:** The vulnerability is exploited locally, meaning an attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **User-controlled data:** The attacker controls the `escape->size` value passed to the driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send IOCTLs to the vulnerable driver.
- The attacker requires local access to the targeted system.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious `escape->size` value and associated data payload.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit-db.com entry provides a code snippet demonstrating the vulnerable code, showing how the `escape->size` user-controlled value is used in a loop to copy data to and from a global array.
- The exploit-db entry mentions a Proof of Concept (PoC) that causes a kernel crash.
- NVIDIA's security bulletin provides additional details including the CVSS score and affected products
- The NVIDIA bulletin states that the vulnerability exists in the `nvlddmkm.sys` file of the Windows GPU Display Driver.
- NVIDIA lists affected products as Quadro, NVS, Tesla, GeForce and GRID series.
