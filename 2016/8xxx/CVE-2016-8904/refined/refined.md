Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8904:

**CVE-2016-8904:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input used in the `ORDER BY` clause of SQL queries. Specifically, the `_EXT_12_orderby` parameter in the "Containers pages" screen of dotCMS is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:** The application directly concatenates the user-controlled `_EXT_12_orderby` parameter into an SQL query without sufficient validation or sanitization.
*  **Vulnerability:** SQL injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or other malicious actions. The specific impact will depend on the permissions of the database user used by the application and the database system it connects to. This is considered a "partially blind" SQL injection, meaning attackers may not get direct data output but can still extract data via boolean based conditions.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `_EXT_12_orderby` parameter within a crafted HTTP request to the `/c/portal/layout` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be authenticated as a user of the dotCMS application. The vulnerability is present in the "Site Browser > Containers pages" screen of the application admin UI.

**Additional Notes from Content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in dotCMS versions before 3.3.1.
*   The identified SQL injection is part of a larger set of similar vulnerabilities (8 in total) reported in dotCMS related to unsanitized `ORDER BY` parameters.
*   The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) URL demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability through the `_EXT_12_orderby` parameter.
*  The vulnerability can be exploited to perform "partially blind" SQL injection attacks by using the injected code to manipulate the output of the queries based on boolean conditions.
