Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-8824:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver (nvlddmkm.sys) improperly handles access controls within the DxgkDdiEscape handler. This allows a regular user to write to parts of the registry that are intended for privileged users only.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Improper access control. Specifically, a lack of sufficient checks to prevent a low-privileged user from modifying registry keys that should be restricted to higher privilege levels.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: Escalation of privileges, potentially allowing a regular user to gain elevated access to the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler within the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver. Specifically, a user-mode process can send a specific request to the driver that exploits this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be a local user on the system to trigger the vulnerable code path. No special user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
