- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of input validation in the processing of Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflows due to malformed RSVP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Occasional device restarts, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted, malformed RSVP packet to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker, network access to a device with an enabled RSVP interface.
