{
    "CVE-2016-8645": {
        "Root cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that `sk_filter()` can truncate the incoming skb, but the TCP stack was not expecting this behavior. Specifically, the TCP stack was crashing in `tcp_collapse()`.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "The TCP stack was not correctly handling the truncation of skb by `sk_filter()` which resulted in a `BUG()` statement being hit, possibly due to the TCP header being removed.",
             "Memory corruption"
        ],
        "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a potential system crash due to a `BUG()` statement being hit in `net/ipv4/tcp_input.c` and memory corruption when unloading/loading the module.",
        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by making a number of certain syscalls.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to trigger specific syscall sequences that will lead to the exploitation. The specific syscall sequences are not detailed.",
         "Additional Details": "The vulnerability was introduced with the tcp-fastopen feature in kernel v3.6-rc1, specifically commit `cf60af03ca`. The vulnerability is easier to trigger since kernel v3.12 due to commit `0d41cca490` where the default value of 'net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen' was changed to 1. The bug is present in affected kernels when 'net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen' is set to 1. A patch has been created that takes into account that `sk_filter()` can truncate the incoming skb and adjusts `TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->end_seq` accordingly. Furthermore, there were memory corruption problems triggered by the fix which were then patched. The fix for the memory corruption issue was merged in RHEL 7.4"
