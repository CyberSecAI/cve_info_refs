- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation allows directory traversal via specially crafted URL requests containing "dot dot" sequences (/../).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A remote attacker can view arbitrary files on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted URL request with directory traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker with low privileges can exploit this vulnerability
