- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hard-coded credentials within IBM dashDB Local.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The use of hard-coded credentials which can be exploited by an attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access or control by exploiting the hard-coded credentials. The specifics of the impact are not specified but would depend on the privileges associated with the compromised credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is due to the presence of hard-coded credentials which could be obtained and used by an attacker. Specific attack vectors are not described, but it suggests the vulnerability is exploitable given access to the hardcoded credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to somehow acquire the hard-coded credentials. No specific position is mentioned but it would be necessary to interact with the system or its components to achieve exploitation.
