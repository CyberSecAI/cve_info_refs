| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1387232#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-20 12:14:28 UTC  ``` The remote execution plugin runs commands on hosts over SSH from the Foreman web UI. When a job is submitted that contains HTML tags, the console output shown in the web UI does not escape the output causing any HTML or JavaScript to run in the user's browser. The output of the job is stored, making this a stored XSS vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1387232#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-20 12:14:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Sanket Jagtap (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1387232#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-24 11:18:59 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/17066/>  Proposed patch:  <https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_remote_execution/pull/208>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1387232#c3)  Ivan Necas    2016-10-24 18:03:10 UTC  ``` The patch was accepted upstream, I've filed against Satellite product as [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1388202](show_bug.cgi?id=1388202 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2016-8613 - XSS in live output") to match the issue   ``` |  |

If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**Satellite project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SAT)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs will be migrated starting at the end of May. If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**Satellite project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SAT)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SAT-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.
