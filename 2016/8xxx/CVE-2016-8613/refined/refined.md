Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8613:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper output escaping in the Foreman Remote Execution plugin. Specifically, when a remote execution job produces output containing HTML tags, the web UI doesn't sanitize this output before displaying it. This allows the embedded HTML and JavaScript to be rendered directly within the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a stored XSS vulnerability. This occurs because the output of remote execution jobs, including malicious HTML or JavaScript, is stored and later displayed without proper sanitization, enabling a persistent attack vector against users of the Foreman web UI.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session who are viewing the remote execution job output. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
  - Session hijacking via stealing of cookies
  - Unauthorized actions performed using the user's credentials
  - Defacement of the web interface
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Potentially, further attacks against the infrastructure itself, depending on access of the user being attacked.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a user submitting a remote execution job through the Foreman web UI that produces malicious HTML and/or JavaScript as part of its output. This malicious payload is then stored by the application and displayed to users when viewing the output of this job.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to submit remote execution jobs through the Foreman web UI, using an account that is authorized to use the remote execution functionality.
- The attacker must have the capability of crafting commands that would output malicious HTML or JavaScript to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must know that the output of the job is not properly escaped and be aware that the output is stored and later displayed in the web UI.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by implementing proper output escaping in the live output display.
- The provided information includes links to the upstream fix commit and related bug reports for the Foreman project and Red Hat Satellite.
- Red Hat Bugzilla entry for CVE-2016-8613 references another bugzilla entry [1388202](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1388202) which was marked WONTFIX due to the issue existing in the upstream project.
