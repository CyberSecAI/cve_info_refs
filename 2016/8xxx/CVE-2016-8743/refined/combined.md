# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-21 15:01:58 UTC  ``` Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25, accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.   These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.  Affects versions since 2.2.0 up to 2.4.23  External Reference:  <https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html#2.4.25>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-21 15:04:26 UTC  ```  Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1406823](show_bug.cgi?id=1406823 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-0736 CVE-2016-2161 CVE-2016-8743 httpd: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c6)  Brian Hinz    2017-01-31 13:26:23 UTC  ``` I realize that backporting the upstream fix is non-trivial, but is there any kind of status update that you can provide regarding a potential errata release date?  The status is still marked as "NEW", which implies that it's not even being worked on...  Thanks in advance.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c7)  Luboš Uhliarik    2017-01-31 13:40:58 UTC  ``` Dear Brian, please check bugs for RHEL-7, RHEL-7 Z-stream and RHEL-6. They are all in modified state. I've finished backporting and QE should now take care of it. This is just tracking bug.  Thanks for understanding.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c11)  Dan    2017-03-01 16:51:36 UTC  ``` I am unable to access any of the related bugs for this to see what is going on.

How long should it take to get from there to a package released to customers?  See [comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c7):    Luboš Uhliarik 2017-01-31 08:40:58 EST: Dear Brian, please check bugs for     RHEL-7, RHEL-7 Z-stream and RHEL-6. They are all in modified state. I've     finished backporting and QE should now take care of it. This is just tracking     bug.  This is a high-scoring security problem on everyone's PCI scanners -- it's scoring 4.4, so your customers have to address it within 30 days of detection, and neither of your current RHEL platforms have a fix yet.  This is a pretty bad situation to leave customers in.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c15)  Dan    2017-03-02 18:07:19 UTC  ``` I had found several weeks ago in one of the related bugs (that I can no longer access) that the patched package Lubos mentioned had caused issues with yum and/or satellite server, so there is probably still work going on to fix this, but no status update here is bad.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c16)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-03 09:49:46 UTC  ``` Hello Dan, Trever,  Tracking bugs for the specific products, i.e. RHEL-6 and RHEL-7 in this case, are almost always kept private. As you've already found out, there were some problems with the patch which caused the delay, but we're working on fixing this issue. If you have some questions, please email secalert.

#### Description

Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-11 10:09:24 UTC  ``` The signing function in crypto/ecdsa/ecdsa_ossl.c in certain OpenSSL versions and forks is vulnerable to timing attacks when signing with the standardized elliptic curve P-256 despite featuring constant-time curve operations and modular inversion. A software defect omits setting the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME flag for nonces, failing to take a secure code path in the BN_mod_inverse method and therefore resulting in a cache-timing attack vulnerability. A malicious user with local access can recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.

Sidhpurwala    2017-01-12 08:41:54 UTC  ``` Statement:  In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker needs to be have local (shell) access to the machine where the message is being signed using the ECDSA algorithm with a P-256 elliptic curve key. Then using cache timing attacks (which needs precise timing), on multiple signature runs, the private key could be obtained. Based on the factor that exploitation is difficult, Red Hat Product Security Team has rated this flaw as having Moderate impact. A further security release may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-07 17:46:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Core Services  Via RHSA-2017:1415 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1415](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1415)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-07 17:57:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:1414 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1414](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1414)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-07 18:00:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:1413 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1413](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1413)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c16)  Huzaifa S.

#### Description

The exif\_convert\_any\_to\_int function in ext/exif/exif.c in PHP before 5.6.30, 7.0.x before 7.0.15, and 7.1.x before 7.1.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via crafted EXIF data that triggers an attempt to divide the minimum representable negative integer by -1.

RHSA-2017:1415 - Security Advisory

Issued:

Updated:
2017-06-07
# RHSA-2017:1415 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1721)

## Topic

An update for httpd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)

Note: The fix for the CVE-2016-8743 issue causes httpd to return "400 Bad Request" error to HTTP clients which do not strictly follow HTTP protocol specification. A newly introduced configuration directive "HttpProtocolOptions Unsafe" can be used to re-enable the old less strict parsing. However, such setting also re-introduces the CVE-2016-8743 issue.

Note: Administrators of Red Hat Satellite 5 and Red Hat Satellite Proxy 5 systems should consult Red Hat Knowledgebase article 3013361 linked to in the Reference section before installing this update.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, httpd was unable to correctly check a boundary of an array, and in rare cases it attempted to access an element of an array that was out of bounds. Consequently, httpd terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation fault at proxy\_util.c. With this update, bounds checking has been fixed, and httpd no longer crashes. (BZ#1463354)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : apache2
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-0736 CVE-2016-2161 CVE-2016-8743

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Apache2 HTTP server.

CVE-2016-0736

  RedTeam Pentesting GmbH discovered that mod_session_crypto was
  vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, which could allow an attacker
  to guess the session cookie.

CVE-2016-2161

  Maksim Malyutin discovered that malicious input to mod_auth_digest
  could cause the server to crash, causing a denial of service.

CVE-2016-8743

  David Dennerline, of IBM Security's X-Force Researchers, and Régis
  Leroy discovered problems in the way Apache handled a broad pattern
  of unusual whitespace patterns in HTTP requests. In some
  configurations, this could lead to response splitting or cache
  pollution vulnerabilities.  To fix these issues, this update makes
  Apache httpd be more strict in what HTTP requests it accepts.

  If this causes problems with non-conforming clients, some checks can
  be relaxed by adding the new directive "HttpProtocolOptions unsafe"
  to the configuration.

This update also fixes the issue where mod_reqtimeout was not enabled
by default on new installations.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.10-10+deb8u8.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 2.4.25-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

#### Description

There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

*The initial GA release, Apache httpd 2.4.1, includes fixes for all vulnerabilities which have been resolved in Apache httpd 2.2.22 and all older releases. Consult the [Apache httpd 2.2 vulnerabilities list](vulnerabilities_22.html) for more information.*

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.62

### important: Apache HTTP Server: source code disclosure with handlers configured via AddType ([CVE-2024-40725](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40725))

A partial fix for CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which fixes this issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server proxy encoding problem ([CVE-2024-38473](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38473))

Encoding problem in mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication via crafted requests. This affects configurations where mechanisms other than ProxyPass/ProxyPassMatch or RewriteRule with the 'P' flag are used to configure a request to be proxied, such as SetHandler or inadvertent proxying via CVE-2024-39573. Note that these alternate mechanisms may be used within .htaccess.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Server weakness in mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches filesystem path. ([CVE-2024-38475](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38475))

Improper escaping of output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.

Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.

Vulnerability in core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier are vulnerably to information disclosure, SSRF or local script execution via backend applications whose response headers are malicious or exploitable.

Note: Some legacy uses of the 'AddType' directive to connect a request to a handler must be ported to 'SetHandler' after this fix.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known "slow loris" attack pattern.

This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream memory not reclaimed right away on RST ([CVE-2023-45802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45802))

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### important: HTTP request splitting with mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy ([CVE-2023-25690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25690))

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution.

For example, something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

### low: mod\_auth\_digest possible stack overflow by one nul byte ([CVE-2020-35452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-35452))

Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a stack overflow in mod\_auth\_digest. There is no report of this overflow being exploitable, nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some particular compiler and/or compilation option might make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the size (a single byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow

### important: NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request ([CVE-2021-31618](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31618))

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected mod\_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

Acknowledgements: Apache HTTP server would like to thank LI ZHI XIN from NSFoucs for reporting this.

### important: Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header ([CVE-2020-9490](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9490))

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, when trace/debug was enabled for the HTTP/2 module and on certain traffic edge patterns, logging statements were made on the wrong connection, causing concurrent use of memory pools.

Configuring the LogLevel of mod\_http2 above "info" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

### low: Limited cross-site scripting in mod\_proxy error page ([CVE-2019-10092](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10092))

A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod\_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

### low: Out of bound write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values ([CVE-2017-15710](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15710))

mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

### moderate: Tampering of mod\_session data for CGI applications ([CVE-2018-1283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283))

When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.

A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.33, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned.

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### low: Padding Oracle in Apache mod\_session\_crypto ([CVE-2016-0736](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0736))

Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod\_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now added to prevent such attacks.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### low: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION denial of service ([CVE-2016-8740](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8740))

The HTTP/2 protocol implementation (mod\_http2) had an incomplete handling of the LimitRequestFields directive. This allowed an attacker to inject unlimited request headers into the server, leading to eventual memory exhaustion.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### low: ap\_some\_auth\_required API unusable ([CVE-2015-3185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3185))

A design error in the "ap\_some\_auth\_required" function renders the API unusuable in httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap\_some\_authn\_required API added in 2.4.16 instead.

## A CGI application vulnerability (in 2016) for PHP, Go, Python and others

*httpoxy* is a set of vulnerabilities that affect application code running in CGI, or CGI-like environments. It comes
down to a simple namespace conflict:

* RFC 3875 (CGI) puts the HTTP `Proxy` header from a request into the environment variables as `HTTP_PROXY`
* `HTTP_PROXY` is a popular environment variable used to configure an outgoing proxy

This leads to a remotely exploitable vulnerability. If youâre running PHP or CGI, you should block the `Proxy` header.
[Hereâs how.](#fix-now)

httpoxy is a vulnerability for server-side web applications. If youâre not deploying code, you donât need to worry.

#### What can happen if my web application is vulnerable?

If a vulnerable HTTP client makes an outgoing HTTP connection, while running in a server-side CGI application, an
attacker may be able to:

* Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application
* Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing
* Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy

httpoxy is extremely easy to exploit in basic form. And we expect security
researchers to be able to scan for it quickly. Luckily, if you read on and
find you are affected, [easy mitigations](#fix-now) are available.

## Isnât this old news? Is this still a problem?

httpoxy **was disclosed in mid-2016**. If youâre reading about it now for the first time, you can *probably* relax and
take your time reading about this quaint historical bug that *hopefully* no longer affects any of the applications you
maintain. But you should verify that to your own satisfaction.

The content below this point reflects the original disclosure, and Iâll be leaving the site up and mostly unchanged, other
than noting fix versions where I can. I guess Iâm just saying: the time for urgency was last year.

## What Is Affected

A few things are necessary to be vulnerable:

* Code running under a CGI-like context, where `HTTP_PROXY` becomes a real or emulated environment variable
* An HTTP client that trusts `HTTP_PROXY`, and configures it as the proxy
* That client, used within a request handler, making an HTTP (as opposed to HTTPS) request

For example, the confirmed cases weâve found so far:

| Language | Environment | HTTP client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHP | php-fpm  mod\_php | Guzzle 4+  Artax |
| Python | wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler  twisted.web.twcgi.CGIScript | requests |
| Go | net/http/cgi | net/http |

But obviously there may be languages we havenât considered yet. CGI is a common standard, and
`HTTP_PROXY` seems to be becoming more popular over time. Take the below as a sample of the most
commonly affected scenarios:

### PHP

* Whether you are vulnerable depends on your specific application code and PHP libraries, but the problem
  seems fairly widespread
* Just *using* one of the vulnerable libraries, while processing a userâs request, is exploitable.
* If youâre using a vulnerable library, this vulnerability will affect any version of PHP
  + It even affects alternative PHP runtimes such as HHVM deployed under FastCGI
* It is present in Guzzle, Artax, and probably many, many libraries
  + Guzzle versions in the range `>=4.0.0rc2,<6.2.1` are vulnerable, Guzzle 3 and below is not.
  + Another example is (update: was) in Composerâs StreamContextBuilder utility class

So, for example, if you are using a Drupal module that uses Guzzle `6.2.0` and makes an outgoing HTTP request (for example,
to check a weather API), you are vulnerable to the request that plugin makes being âhttpoxiedâ.

### Python

* Python code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, thatâll mean the vulnerable code
  will use a CGI handler like `wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler`
  + This is not considered a normal way of deploying Python webapps (most people are using WSGI or FastCGI, both of which are
    not affected), so vulnerable Python applications will probably be much rarer than vulnerable PHP applications.
  + wsgi, for example, is not vulnerable, because os.environ is not polluted by CGI data
* Vulnerable versions of the requests library will trust and use `os.environ['HTTP_PROXY']`, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in `2.7.13`, `3.4.6`, `3.5.3`, `3.6.0` (see [the Python advisory](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/cve-2016-1000110_httpoxy_attack.html))

### Go

* Go code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, thatâll mean the vulnerable code uses
  the `net/http/cgi` package.
  + As with Python, this is not considered a usual way of deploying Go as a web application, so this vulnerability should be
    relatively rare
  + Goâs `net/http/fcgi` package, by comparison, does not set actual environment variables, so it is *not* vulnerable
* Vulnerable versions of `net/http` will trust and use `HTTP_PROXY` for outgoing requests, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in Go `1.7rc3`, all stable versions of `>=1.7`

## Immediate Mitigation

The best immediate mitigation is to block `Proxy` request headers as early as possible, and before they hit your
application. This is easy and safe.

* Itâs safe because the `Proxy` header is undefined by the IETF, and isnât listed on the
  [IANAâs registry of message headers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml). This means
  **there is no standard use for the header at all**; not even a provisional use-case.
* Standards-compliant HTTP clients and servers will never read or send this header.
* You can either strip the header or completely block requests attempting to use it.
* You should try to do your mitigation as *early* and as far *upstream* as you can.
  + Do it âat the edgeâ, where HTTP requests first enter your system.
  + That way, you can fix lots of vulnerable software at once.
  + Everything behind a reverse proxy or application firewall that strips the `Proxy` header is safe!

How you block a `Proxy` header depends on the specifics of your setup. The earliest convenient place to block the header
might be at a web application firewall device, or directly on the webserver running Apache or NGINX. Here are a few of
the more common mitigations:

### NGINX/FastCGI

Use this to block the header from being passed on to PHP-FPM, PHP-PM etc.

```
fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";

```

In FastCGI configurations, PHP is vulnerable (but many other languages that use NGINX FastCGI are not).

For specific NGINX coverage, we recommend that you read the official [NGINX blog post](https://www.nginx.com/blog/mitigating-the-httpoxy-vulnerability-with-nginx)
on this vulnerability. The blog post provides a graphic depiction of how
httpoxy works and more extensive mitigation information for NGINX.

### Apache

For specific Apache coverage (and details for other Apache software projects like Tomcat), we strongly recommend
you read the [Apache Software Foundationâs official advisory](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt) on
the matter. The very basic mitigation information youâll find below is covered in much greater depth there.

If youâre using Apache HTTP Server with `mod_cgi`, languages like Go and Python may be vulnerable (the `HTTP_PROXY` env var
is ârealâ). And `mod_php` is affected due to the nature of PHP. If you are using **mod\_headers**, you can unset the
`Proxy` header before further processing with this directive:

```
RequestHeader unset Proxy early

```

Example for using this in `.htaccess` files:

```
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
   RequestHeader unset Proxy
</IfModule>

```

If you are using **mod\_security**, you can use a `SecRule` to deny traffic with a `Proxy` header. Hereâs an example,
vary the action to taste, and make sure `SecRuleEngine` is on. The 1000005 ID has been assigned to this issue.

```
SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Proxy "@gt 0" "id:1000005,log,deny,msg:'httpoxy denied'"

```

Finally, if youâre using Apache Traffic Server, itâs not itself affected, but you can use it to strip the `Proxy` header; very helpful
for any services sitting behind it. Again, see the [ASFâs guidance](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt),
but one possible configuration is:

* Within `plugin.config`, inside the configuration directory (e.g. `/usr/local/etc/trafficserver` or `/etc/trafficserver`),
  add the following directive:

  ```
  header_rewrite.so strip_proxy.conf

  ```
* Add the following to a new file named `strip_proxy.conf` in the same directory:

  ```
  cond %{READ_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK}
  rm-header Proxy

  ```

### HAProxy

This will strip the header off requests:

```
http-request del-header Proxy

```

If your version of HAProxy is old (i.e. `1.4` or earlier), you may not have the `http-request del-header` directive.
If so, you must also take care that headers are stripped from requests served after the first one over an HTTP 1.1
keep-alive connection. (i.e. take special note of the limitation described in the first paragraph of [the 1.4 âheader
manipulationâ documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.4/configuration.html#6))

### Varnish

For Varnish, the following should unset the header. Add it to the pre-existing vcl\_recv section:

```
sub vcl_recv {
    [...]
    unset req.http.proxy;
    [...]
}

```
### OpenBSD relayd

For relayd, the following should remove the header. Add it to a pre-existing filter:

```
http protocol httpfilter {
        match request header remove "Proxy"
}

```
### lighttpd

#### <= 1.4.40

To reject requests containing a `Proxy` header

* Create `/path/to/deny-proxy.lua`, read-only to lighttpd, with the content:

  ```
  if (lighty.request["Proxy"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end

  ```
* Modify `lighttpd.conf` to load `mod_magnet` and run the above lua code:

  ```
  server.modules += ( "mod_magnet" )
  magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua" )

  ```

#### lighttpd2 (development)

To strip the `Proxy` header from the request, add the following to `lighttpd.conf`:

```
req_header.remove "Proxy";

```
### Microsoft IIS with PHP or a CGI framework

For detailed information about mitigating httpoxy on IIS, you should
head to the official [Microsoft article KB3179800](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3179800), which covers
the below mitigations in greater detail.

Also important to know: httpoxy does not affect any Microsoft Web Frameworks, e.g. not ASP.NET nor Active Server Pages.
But if you have installed PHP or any other third party framework on top of IIS, we recommend applying mitigation steps
to protect from httpoxy attacks. You can either block requests containing a `Proxy` header, or clear the header. (The header
is safe to block, because browsers will not generally send it at all).

To *block* requests that contain a `Proxy` header (the preferred solution), run the following command line.

```
appcmd set config /section:requestfiltering /+requestlimits.headerLimits.[header='proxy',sizelimit='0']

```

**Note:** `appcmd.exe` is not typically in the path and can be found in the `%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv` directory

To *clear* the value of the header, use the following URL Rewrite rule:

```
<system.webServer>

**Note:** URL Rewrite is a downloadable add-in for IIS and is not included in a default IIS installation.

### Hiawatha

You can block any request containing a `Proxy` header (or ban the sending client) via the UrlToolkit:

```
UrlToolkit {
  ToolkitID = block_httpoxy
  Header Proxy .* DenyAccess
}

```

See more information at the [hiawatha blog](https://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/weblog/115)

### LiteSpeed Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 5.0.19` or `>= 5.1.7` to mitigate. You can do this manually with one of these commands, or youâll get
an upgrade notification soon.

```
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.0.19 # or
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.1.7

```

See more information at the [litespeed blog](http://blog.litespeedtech.com/2016/07/18/the-httpoxy-vulnerability-has-been-taken-care-of-by-litespeed-automatically/)

### h2o Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 2.0.2` and add this to your configuration:

```
setenv:
  HTTP_PROXY: ""

```

More information can be found in this [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/996).

### Other CGI software and applications

Please let us know of other places where httpoxy is found. Weâd be happy to help you communicate fixes for your platform,
server or library if you are affected. Contact contact@httpoxy.org to let us
know. Or create a PR or issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org) in GitHub.

## Ineffective fixes in PHP

Userland PHP fixes donât work. Donât bother:

* Using `unset($_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY'])` does not affect the value returned from `getenv()`, so is not an effective
  mitigation
* Using `putenv('HTTP_PROXY=')` does not work either (to be precise: it only works if that value is coming from an
  actual environment variable rather than a header â so, it cannot be used for mitigation)

## Prevention

### Summary

* If you can avoid it, do not deploy into environments where the CGI data is merged into the actual environment variables
* Use and expect `CGI_HTTP_PROXY` to set the proxy for a CGI applicationâs internal requests, if necessary
  + You can still support `HTTP_PROXY`, but you must assert that CGI is not in use
  + In PHP, check `PHP_SAPI == 'cli'`
  + Otherwise, a simple check is to not trust `HTTP_PROXY` if `REQUEST_METHOD` is also set. RFC 3875 seems to require
    this meta-variable:

    > The `REQUEST_METHOD` meta-variable MUST be set to the method which should be used by the script to process the request

### Donât Trust `HTTP_PROXY` Under CGI

To put it plainly: there is no way to trust the value of an `HTTP_` env var in a CGI environment. They cannot be
distinguished from request headers according to the specification. So, *any* usage of `HTTP_PROXY` in a CGI context is
suspicious.

If you need to configure the proxy of a CGI application via an environment variable, use a variable name that will
never conflict with request headers. That is: one that does not begin with `HTTP_`. We strongly recommend you go for
`CGI_HTTP_PROXY`. (As seen in Ruby and libwww-perlâs mitigations for this issue.)

### PHP

CLI-only code may safely trust `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` or `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`. But bear in mind that code written
for the CLI context often ends up running in a SAPI eventually, particularly utility or library code. And, with open
source code, that might not even be your doing. So, if you are going to rely on `HTTP_PROXY` at all, you should guard
that code with a check of the `PHP_SAPI` constant.

### Network Configuration as Prevention

A defense-in-depth strategy that can combat httpoxy (and entire classes of other security problems) is to severely restrict
the outgoing requests your web application can make to an absolute minimum. For example, if a web application is
firewalled in such a way that it *cannot* make outgoing HTTP requests, an attacker will not be able to receive
the âmisproxiedâ requests (because the web application is prevented from connecting to the attacker).

### HTTPS

And, of course, another defense-in-depth strategy that works is to use HTTPS for internal requests, not just for
securing your siteâs connections to the outside world. HTTPS requests arenât affected by `HTTP_PROXY`.

## How It Works

Using PHP as an example, because it is illustrative. PHP has a method called `getenv()`[1](#fn:php-getenv).

There is a common vulnerability in many PHP libraries and applications, introduced by confusing
`getenv` for a method that only returns environment variables. In fact, getenv() is closer to the
`$_SERVER` superglobal: it contains both environment variables and user-controlled data.

Specifically, when PHP is running under a CGI-like server, the HTTP request headers (data supplied
by the client) are merged into the `$_SERVER` superglobal under keys beginning with `HTTP_`. This is
the same information that `getenv` reads from.

When a user sends a request with a `Proxy` header, the header appears to the PHP application as `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`.
Some common PHP libraries have been trusting this value, even when run in a CGI/SAPI environment.

Reading and trusting `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` is exactly the same vulnerability, but tends to happen much less often
(perhaps because of getenvâs name, perhaps because the semantics of the `$_SERVER` superglobal are better understood among
the community).

### Minimal example code

Note that these examples require deployment into a vulnerable environment before there is actually a vulnerability
(e.g. php-fpm, or Apacheâs `ScriptAlias`)

#### PHP

```
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$client->get('http://api.internal/?secret=foo')

```
#### Python

```
from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
def application(environ, start_response):
    requests.get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
CGIHandler().run(application)

```
#### Go

```
cgi.Serve(
    http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        res, _ := http.Get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
        // [...]

```

More complete PoC repos (using Docker, and testing with an actual listener for the proxied request) have been prepared
under the [httpoxy Github organization](https://github.com/httpoxy).

## Why It Happened

Under the CGI spec, headers are provided mixed into the environment variables. (These are formally known as
âProtocol-Specific Meta-Variablesâ[2](#fn:meta-variables)). Thatâs just the way the spec works, not a failure or bug.

The goal of the code, in most of the vulnerabilities, is to find the correct proxy to use, when auto-configuring a
client for the internal HTTP request made shortly after. This task in Ruby could be completed by
the `find_proxy` method of `URI::Generic`, which notes:

> `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY` are treated specially under the CGI environment, because `HTTP_PROXY` may be set by Proxy:
> header. So `HTTP_PROXY` is not used. `http_proxy` is not used too if the variable is case insensitive. `CGI_HTTP_PROXY`
> can be used instead.
>
> From the [Ruby stdlib documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI/Generic.html#method-i-find_proxy)

Other instances of the same vulnerability are present in other languages. For example, when
using Goâs `net/http/cgi` module, and deploying as a CGI application. This indicates the vulnerability
is a standard danger in CGI environments.

## History of httpoxy

This bug was first discovered over 15 years ago. The timeline goes something like:

March 2001

The issue is discovered in libwww-perl and fixed. Reported by Randal L. Schwartz. [3](#fn:perl-bug)

April 2001

The issue is discovered in curl, and fixed there too (albeit probably not for Windows). Reported by Cris Bailiff. [4](#fn:curl-bug)

July 2012

In implementing `HTTP_PROXY` for `Net::HTTP`, the Ruby team notice and avoid the potential issue. Nice work Akira Tanaka! [5](#fn:ruby-ref)

November 2013

The issue is mentioned on the NGINX mailing list. The user humbly points out the issue: âunless
Iâm missing something, which is very possibleâ. No, Jonathan Matthews, you were exactly right! [6](#fn:nginx-ref)

February 2015

The issue is mentioned on the Apache httpd-dev mailing list. Spotted by Stefan Fritsch. [7](#fn:apache-ref)

July 2016

Scott Geary, an engineer at Vend, found an instance of the bug in the wild. The Vend security team found the vulnerability
was still exploitable in PHP, and present in many modern languages and libraries. We started to disclose to security response teams.

So, the bug was lying dormant for years, like a latent infection: pox. We imagine that many people may have found the issue over
the years, but never investigated its scope in other languages and libraries. If youâve found a historical discussion
of interest that weâve missed, let us know. You can contact contact@httpoxy.org
or create an issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org).

## CVEs

httpoxy has a number of CVEs assigned. These cover the cases where

* a language or CGI implementation makes the `Proxy` header available in such a way that the application cannot tell whether
  it is a real environment variable, or
* an application trusts the value of the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable by default in a CGI environment (but only where that application should have been
  able to tell it came from a request)

The assigned CVEs so far:

* CVE-2016-5385: PHP
* CVE-2016-5386: Go
* CVE-2016-5387: Apache HTTP Server
* CVE-2016-5388: Apache Tomcat
* CVE-2016-6286: spiffy-cgi-handlers for CHICKEN
* CVE-2016-6287: CHICKENâs http-client
* CVE-2016-1000104: mod\_fcgi
* CVE-2016-1000105: Nginx cgi script
* CVE-2016-1000107: Erlang inets
* CVE-2016-1000108: YAWS
* CVE-2016-1000109: HHVM FastCGI
* CVE-2016-1000110: Python CGIHandler
* CVE-2016-1000111: Python Twisted
* CVE-2016-1000212: lighttpd

We suspect there may be more CVEs coming for httpoxy, as less common software is checked over. If you
want to get a CVE assigned for an httpoxy issue, there are a couple of options:

* For open source code projects, you can use the [Distributed Weakness Filing Project](https://distributedweaknessfiling.org/) (DWF).
  They have a simple way to report (public) issues using the form at [iwantacve.org](https://iwantacve.org/)
* For closed source code projects, you can talk to [MITRE, or one of their participating CNAs/vendors/coordinators](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html).

Over the past two weeks, the Vend security team worked to disclose the issue responsibly to as many affected parties as we
could. Weâd like to thank the members of:

* The Red Hat Product Security team, who provided extremely useful advice and access to their experience disclosing
  widespread vulnerabilities - if youâre sitting on a big or complicated disclosure, theyâre a great resource to reach
  out to for help.
* The language and implementation teams, who kept to disclosure norms and provided lively discussion.

#### Description

The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue. NOTE: the vendor states "This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.

# Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-36**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Apache, the worst of
which could lead to a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.25** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.25** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache. Please review
the CVE identifiers, upstream Apache Software Foundation documentation,
and HTTPoxy website referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service condition via multiple
vectors or response splitting and cache pollution. Additionally, an
attacker could intercept unsecured (HTTP) transmissions via the HTTPoxy
vulnerability.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.4.25"

```

#### Description

The mod\_http2 module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 through 2.4.23, when the Protocols configuration includes h2 or h2c, does not restrict request-header length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via crafted CONTINUATION frames in an HTTP/2 request.

# [R5] SecurityCenter 5.4.3 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

SecurityCenter has recently been discovered to contain several vulnerabilities. Four issues in the SC code were discovered during internal testing by Barry Clark, and several third-party libraries were upgraded as part of our internal security process. Note that the library vulnerabilities were not fully diagnosed so SecurityCenter is possibly impacted. Tenable opted to upgrade the libraries as it was more efficient than diagnosing each issue. Details of the issues are below, with VDB IDs and/or internal IDs for your tracking pleasure. Note that not all library vulnerabilities have a CVE assignment:

* PHP ext/phar/phar.c phar\_parse\_pharfile() Function Phar Archive Handling Out-of-bounds Read DoS
* PHP ext/exif/exif.c exif\_convert\_any\_to\_int() Function TIFF / JPEG Image Tag Handling Floating Pointer Exception Remote DoS (CVE-2016-10158)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

## Introduction

In 2010, a fix to the `yum-rhn-plugin` was introduced which contained a bug involving the whitespace between headers in the HTTP requests between a Red Hat Satellite or Proxy and its clients. The error was incorrect by the HTTP RFC standards, but (at the time) was harmless due to lenient whitespace processing in `httpd`.

In 2016, [CVE-2016-8743](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2016-8743) was made public concerning a potential security exploit involving this lenient processing. The subsequent tightening of `httpd`’s rules uncovered the latent issue in `yum-rhn-plugin` during automated testing leading up to the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.9 in early 2017.

This does not impact Satellite 6 or Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM).

## Implications

Correcting the rules of `httpd` resulted in communications from clients affected by the `yum-rhn-plugin` bug being rejected by Satellite and Proxy servers with updated `httpd` instances.

Providing a fix for the client is insufficient, since once `httpd` on the server is updated, the client can no longer call home to get the fix.

A configuration-change on the server is needed to “turn off” strict whitespace enforcement. The `httpd` update provided an option for doing so - however, the option to disable strict whitespace enforcement only exists in newer versions of `httpd`, and should only be enabled in versions of `httpd` which support it.

## Symptoms and Workarounds

The specific symptom on client systems is a traceback caused by receiving an “HTTP Error 400” response from the Satellite or Proxy server. An example traceback might look like this:

```
# tail /var/log/up2date
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/yum/yumRepo.py", line 1685, in _getRepoXML
    self._loadRepoXML(text=self.ui_id)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/yum/yumRepo.py", line 1676, in _loadRepoXML
    return self._groupLoadRepoXML(text, self._mdpolicy2mdtypes())
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/yum/yumRepo.py", line 1650, in _groupLoadRepoXML
    if self._commonLoadRepoXML(text):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/yum/yumRepo.py", line 1470, in _commonLoadRepoXML
    result = self._getFileRepoXML(local, text)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/yum/yumRepo.py", line 1248, in _getFileRepoXML
    size=102400) # setting max size as 100K
  File "/usr/share/yum-plugins/rhnplugin.py", line 399, in _getFile
    start, end, copy_local, checkfunc, text, reget, cache, size)
  File "/usr/share/yum-plugins/rhnplugin.py", line 501, in _noExceptionWrappingGet
    raise urlException
<class 'yum.Errors.RepoError'>: failed to retrieve repodata/repomd.xml from rhel-x86_64-server-7
error was [Errno 14] HTTP Error 400 - Bad Request

```

With the following showing on the server-side:

```
# tail /var/log/httpd/error_log
[Wed Feb 15 07:37:56 2017] [error] [client 10.10.10.10] request failed: error reading the headers

```

The initial workaround is to downgrade `httpd` to the previous version.

A configuration-option workaround is to add the following new `httpd` config file:

```
# echo “HTTPProtocolOptions unsafe” >> /etc/httpd/conf.d/123unsafe.conf; service httpd restart

```

Either of these changes turns off strict-enforcement until such time as all clients can be updated with the fix to `yum-rhn-plugin`.

## Complications

The first priority for the fix is to insure that clients, no matter what their current state, can always call home to get fixes. This leads to the preferred option on the Satellite and/or Proxy being a configuration-file change with the above `HTTPProtocolOptions unsafe` set. As noted, however, that option is only available for the affected version of `httpd`, and later. Also, the change should optimally be correct for both Fedora and RHEL, to minimize distance between the upstream and downstream code bases.

The standard way to “protect” an `httpd` config option from specific versions of `httpd`, is via the `<IfVersion>` tag. So

```
<IfVersion >= 2.4.25>
  HttpProtocolOptions unsafe
</IfVersion>

```

should do the job for us (where 2.4.25 is the version of `httpd` released to Fedora with the strict-whitespace changes)

However - RHEL versions stay at the upstream version they were initially pulled from, with only the release field being updated (for RHEL6, for example, `httpd` is always version `httpd-2.2.15`). And `<IfVersion>` doesn’t understand release-differences.

Addressing this required the addition of a directive built into the RHEL6.9 version of `httpd`, `_RH_HAS_HTTPPROTOCOLOPTIONS`. With this directive available, we could protect older versions of `httpd` on Fedora using `<IfVersion>`, and protect older versions of `httpd` on RHEL by checking for the existence of the directive with `<IfDefine>`. The result is a set of configuration options like so:

```
<IfVersion >= 2.4.25>
  HttpProtocolOptions unsafe
</IfVersion>
<IfDefine _RH_HAS_HTTPPROTOCOLOPTIONS>
  HTTPProtocolOptions unsafe
</IfDefine>

```
## Current State

**README**: Before applying errata, please thoroughly read and follow **Proposed Corrective Workflow** section below, since the **order of steps matter**.

Errata have been released to fix the client-side issue with `yum-rhn-plugin` for the following versions of RHEL:

* [6.2](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0555)
* [6.4](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0556)
* [6.5](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0843)
* [6.6](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0554)
* [6.7](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0870)
* [6.8](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0353)
* [7.1](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0845)
* [7.2](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0509)
* [7.3](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0917)

Since the RHEL5 clients never received the whitespace patch, there is no need to patch them.

Errata have been released to address the server-side issue by providing a new `httpd` configuration file which turns off the strict-whitespace-enforcing behavior of `httpd`, that works for all RHEL6 installs of Red Hat Satellite and Proxy 5:

* [Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0896)
* [Proxy](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0897)

The whitespace-enforcing version of `httpd` has been released for RHEL 6 - please read "Proposed Corrective Workflow" section below for any potention action needed *before* applying this httpd errata.

The client-side fix is available as part of the RHEL 6.9 release.

The server-side fix is available as part of the Red Hat Satellite 5.8 release. However Satellite 5.8 customers still need to apply the client-side fix per steps below.

Installations on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are unaffected by the problem, because the `httpd` fix was never provided for RHEL5. *Also please NOTE* that Red Hat Satellite/Proxy 5 running on RHEL 5 have reached End-of-Life: [End-of-Life (EOL) notification for Red Hat Satellite 5 running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](https://access.redhat.com/articles/2868391)

Spacewalk, the upstream for Satellite5, has had the backend-config-file released for Fedora24 and Fedora25, and RHEL6. Unfortunately, the version of `httpd` on RHEL7 has had the fix backported, but is still a lower version than that found in Fedora. Investigation into how to correctly handle the “Spacewalk installed on RHEL7 case” continues.

## Proposed Corrective Workflow

In order to be able to use the newly-secured `httpd`([RHSA-2017:1721](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1721)), with strict-whitespace-enforcement turned on, while still allowing all clients to be able to communicate with server, the Satellite user needs to execute the following steps **in order**:

### HOW TO KNOW IF ACTION IS NEEDED:

You can confirm whether the version of Satellite you are running is affected.

You can do this via the `rpm` command

`rpm -q spacewalk-backend`

If the version of the `spacewalk-backend` package is lower than the below, please update using the `yum` command.

If the version of the spacewalk-backend package is greater than or equal to the below, no action is required.

* Red Hat Satellite 5.7 (spacewalk-backend-2.3.3-48.el6sat)
* Red Hat Satellite 5.6 for RHEL 6 (spacewalk-backend-2.0.3-44.el6sat)
* Red Hat Satellite 5.6 for RHEL 5 (spacewalk-backend-2.0.3-44.el5sat)
* Red Hat Satellite with Embedded Oracle 5.5 for RHEL 6 (spacewalk-backend-1.7.38-56.el6sat)
* Red Hat Satellite with Embedded Oracle 5.5 for RHEL 5 (spacewalk-backend-1.7.38-56.el5sat)
* Red Hat Satellite with Embedded Oracle 5.4 for RHEL 6 (spacewalk-backend-1.2.13-84.el6sat)
* Red Hat Satellite with Embedded Oracle 5.4 for RHEL 5 (spacewalk-backend-1.2.13-84.el5sat)

### Applying the Errata.

1. Apply the Satellite and Proxy errata described above (**Current State** section) to the Satellite and Proxy server, in order to let all clients continue to connect. *Satellite/Proxy 5.8 customers: skip this step and move on to Step 2* (the server-side fix is included in 5.8, however you still need to apply client-side steps below).
2. Sync the latest content for the RHEL base channels in use on the Satellite. This will pick up the `yum-rhn-plugin` fix.
3. Promote that fix (as carried in the client-side errata described above) through the system’s SOE.
4. Update **ALL CLIENTS** with the fix.
5. Update **ALL KICKSTARTS** to obtain the new `yum-rhn-plugin` as part of kickstarting
6. Once **ALL clients and kickstarts** are updated, comment out the contents of `/etc/httpd/conf.d/aa-spacewalk-server.conf` and restart `httpd` on the Satellite and/or Proxy.

**ORDER MATTERS** - turning strict-enforcement back on, before insuring that all clients have the `yum-rhn-plugin` fix installed, will results in those clients being unable to call home for updates!

# RHSA-2017:0906 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0906)

## Topic

An update for httpd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)

Note: The fix for the CVE-2016-8743 issue causes httpd to return "400 Bad Request" error to HTTP clients which do not strictly follow HTTP protocol specification. A newly introduced configuration directive "HttpProtocolOptions Unsafe" can be used to re-enable the old less strict parsing. However, such setting also re-introduces the CVE-2016-8743 issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* When waking up child processes during a graceful restart, the httpd parent process could attempt to open more connections than necessary if a large number of child processes had been active prior to the restart. Consequently, a graceful restart could take a long time to complete. With this update, httpd has been fixed to limit the number of connections opened during a graceful restart to the number of active children, and the described problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1420002)
* Previously, httpd running in a container returned the 500 HTTP status code (Internal Server Error) when a connection to a WebSocket server was closed. As a consequence, the httpd server failed to deliver the correct HTTP status and data to a client. With this update, httpd correctly handles all proxied requests to the WebSocket server, and the described problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1429947)
* In a configuration using LDAP authentication with the mod\_authnz\_ldap module, the name set using the AuthLDAPBindDN directive was not correctly used to bind to the LDAP server for all queries. Consequently, authorization attempts failed. The LDAP modules have been fixed to ensure the configured name is correctly bound for LDAP queries, and authorization using LDAP no longer fails. (BZ#1420047)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1414)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

## Topic

Updated httpd24 packages are now available as a part of Red Hat Software Collections 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server. The httpd24 packages provide a recent stable release of version 2.4 of the Apache HTTP Server, along with the mod\_auth\_kerb module.

The httpd24 Software Collection has been upgraded to version 2.4.25, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. For detailed changes, see the Red Hat Software Collections 2.4 Release Notes linked from the References section. (BZ#1404778)

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* A denial of service flaw was found in httpd's mod\_http2 module. A remote attacker could use this flaw to block server threads for long times, causing starvation of worker threads, by manipulating the flow control windows on streams. (CVE-2016-1546)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)

Note: The fix for the CVE-2016-8743 issue causes httpd to return "400 Bad Request" error to HTTP clients which do not strictly follow HTTP protocol specification. A newly introduced configuration directive "HttpProtocolOptions Unsafe" can be used to re-enable the old less strict parsing. However, such setting also re-introduces the CVE-2016-8743 issue.

* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.
