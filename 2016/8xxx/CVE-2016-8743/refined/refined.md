{
  "CVE-2016-8743": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers, potentially leading to request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution.",
    "root_cause": "The Apache HTTP Server accepted a broad range of whitespace characters, including bare CR, FF, VTAB, and HTAB, which are not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of whitespace characters in HTTP requests and headers.",
      "Lack of strict adherence to HTTP protocol specifications, particularly RFC7230."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning, request smuggling, and response splitting.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted HTTP requests with non-standard whitespace characters in headers and the request line.",
       "Exploitation requires interaction with proxies or backend servers that do not strictly adhere to HTTP specification."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the target server or a proxy sitting in front of it, no authentication is required.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability stems from a broad acceptance of unusual whitespace patterns, creating a discrepancy in how different agents in a proxy chain or backend systems interpret these patterns. This inconsistency may lead to request smuggling, where a single request is interpreted as multiple requests by the backend server or to cache poisoning. The issue is resolved by tightening whitespace handling in httpd, but can be relaxed with the 'HttpProtocolOptions unsafe' directive for backward compatibility. This issue also causes a yum update issue when using Red Hat Satellite 5."
