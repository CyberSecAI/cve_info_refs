- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler within the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`). A user-provided value is used as the size input to the `memcpy()` function without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the unchecked size parameter in the `memcpy()` operation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to denial of service or potential escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send specific inputs to the `DxgkDdiEscape` function, which is accessible from user-mode.
