Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8903:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `_EXT_13_orderby` parameter within the "Templates pages" screen in dotCMS. This parameter directly influences the SQL query's ORDER BY clause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the ORDER BY clause of a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL Command Execution: An attacker can execute malicious SQL commands, which can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration/manipulation: Access, modification, or deletion of sensitive information.
    - Potential for privilege escalation if the database user has excessive privileges.
    - Denial of service: Causing errors or crashes by executing malicious queries.
- Because it is a partly blind SQL injection, the attacker can only get boolean answers from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET parameter manipulation: The `_EXT_13_orderby` parameter is transmitted in the URL as a GET parameter.
- Authenticated access is needed to reach the vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker must have valid user credentials to access the vulnerable "Templates pages" screen within the dotCMS admin interface.

**Additional Details:**

-   The provided content highlights that this is one of eight SQL injection vulnerabilities found in dotCMS that were reported at the same time. All of them are in "order by" parameters.
-   The vulnerability is present in dotCMS versions prior to 3.3.1.
-   The provided proof-of-concept URL demonstrates how the vulnerability can be triggered by injecting SQL code through the `_EXT_13_orderby` parameter:
   ```
   /c/portal/layout?p\_l\_id=b7ab5d3c-5ee0-4195-a17e-8f5579d718dd&p\_p\_id=EXT\_13&p\_p\_action=0&p\_p\_state=maximized&p\_p\_mode=view&\_EXT\_13\_struts\_action=%2Fext%2Ftemplates%2Fview\_templates&\_EXT\_13\_pageNumber=1&\_EXT\_13\_orderby=`SQLi`
   ```
   The `SQLi` placeholder represents the malicious SQL code injected.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in dotCMS version 3.3.1, as well as later versions.
