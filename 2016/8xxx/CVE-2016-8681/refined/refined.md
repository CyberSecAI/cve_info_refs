Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `_dwarf_get_abbrev_for_code` function within `dwarf_util.c` of the libdwarf library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The code reads beyond the allocated memory region on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the application using a specially crafted DWARF file.
- The AddressSanitizer output indicates a read of size 1 outside the allocated memory region, suggesting a potential for information disclosure or further exploitation, although this isn't explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malicious DWARF file.
- Specifically, the `dwarfdump` utility is mentioned as a way to trigger the vulnerability, implying that the attack vector involves processing a malicious input file with the tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted DWARF file to an application that uses the vulnerable `libdwarf` library.
- Specifically, an attacker needs to be able to execute the `dwarfdump` utility with the crafted DWARF file to trigger the vulnerability, or have a program process a crafted file using the libdwarf library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
- The bug was fixed in version `20161124` of `libdwarf`.
- The fix involved two commits to the libdwarf repository due to an initial mistake in the first fix.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2016-8681.

The information provided by the blog post and the bugzilla entry give more detail than the basic CVE description, especially with respect to the affected code, the crash output and the fix commits.
