{
  "CVE-2016-8625": {
    "Root cause": "curl was using an outdated IDNA 2003 standard for International Domain Names (IDNs) when it should have been using the IDNA 2008 standard.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Outdated standard",
      "Incorrect puny code conversion"
    ],
    "Impact": "Users could unknowingly connect to the wrong host when accessing domains containing characters like 'ÃŸ' (LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S) which are translated differently in the two IDNA standards.",
    "Attack vectors": "A user visiting a URL containing an internationalized domain name that includes a character translated differently by IDNA 2003 and IDNA 2008 standards.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or manipulate the domain name being requested by the client, and the targeted application needs to use `curl` built with `libidn`."
