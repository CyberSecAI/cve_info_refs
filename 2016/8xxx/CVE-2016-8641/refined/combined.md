CVE-2016-8641 Nagios 4.2.2 - root privilege escalation
Credits:   Vincent Malguy

Description (from wikipedia) :
Nagios /ˈnɑːɡiːoʊs/, now known as Nagios Core, is a free and open source computer-software application that monitors systems, networks and infrastructure. Nagios offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications and services. It alerts users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when the problem has been resolved.

********************* CVE-2016-8641 Nagios 4.2.2 - root privilege escalation  *********************
Using official installation instruction  at https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/quickstart-ubuntu.html,
nagios' user is create with a shell :

Create a new nagios user account and give it a password.
/usr/sbin/useradd -m -s /bin/bash nagios

leading to a  entry in /etc/passwd like this "nagios:x:1001:1001::/home/nagios:/bin/bash"

This means that if someone has access to the nagios account, he can access any files own by nagios.

The Nagios startup script, run by root, is insecurely giving owner of file to nagios use :
(/etc/init.d/nagios: line 190)
touch $NagiosRunFile
chown $NagiosUser:$NagiosGroup $NagiosRunFile $NagiosVarDir/nagios.log $NagiosRetentionFile

If Nagios user symlink $NagiosRunFile to a file that he has no access to, at startup or reboot   of the nagios daemon, the init script with give him ownership of the linked file.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Nagios: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201702-26**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Nagios, the worst of
which could lead to privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/nagios-core** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.4** |

### Background

Nagios is an open source host, service and network monitoring program.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Nagios. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker, who either is already Nagios’s system user or
belongs to Nagios’s group, could potentially escalate privileges.

In addition, a remote attacker could read or write to arbitrary files by
spoofing a crafted response from the Nagios RSS feed server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Nagios users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/nagios-core-4.2.4"

```

#### Introduction

This guide is intended to provide you with simple instructions on how to install Nagios from source (code) on Ubuntu and have it monitoring your local machine inside of 20 minutes. No advanced installation options are discussed here - just the basics that will work for 95% of users who want to get started.

These instructions were written based on an **Ubuntu 14.04 - Server** installation. They should work with most recent vesrions of Ubuntu with minor changes on some versions.

#### What You'll End Up With

If you follow these instructions, here's what you'll end up with:

* Nagios and the plugins will be installed underneath /usr/local/nagios
* Nagios will be configured to monitor a few aspects of your local system (CPU load, disk usage, etc.)
* The Nagios web interface will be accessible at http://localhost/nagios/

#### Required Packages

Make sure you've installed the following packages on your Ubuntu installation before continuing.

* Apache 2
* PHP
* GCC compiler and development libraries
* GD development libraries

You can use *apt-get* to install these packages by running the following commands:

```

sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 build-essential libgd-dev

```

#### 1) Create Account Information

Become the root user.

```

sudo -s

```

Create a new *nagios* user account and give it a password.

```

/usr/sbin/useradd -m -s /bin/bash nagios
passwd nagios

```

You will need to also add a *nagios* group (if it's not created by default).

```

/usr/sbin/groupadd nagios
/usr/sbin/usermod -G nagios nagios

```

Create a new *nagcmd* group for allowing external commands to be submitted through the web interface. Add both the nagios user and the apache user to the group.

```

/usr/sbin/groupadd nagcmd
/usr/sbin/usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios
/usr/sbin/usermod -a -G nagcmd www-data

```

#### 2) Download Nagios and the Plugins

Create a directory for storing the downloads.

```

mkdir ~/downloads
cd ~/downloads

```

Download the source code tarballs of both Nagios Core and the Nagios plugins (visit <https://www.nagios.org/download/> for links to the latest versions). These directions were tested with Nagios 4.2.1 and Nagios Plugins 2.1.3.

```

wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/nagios/nagios-4.2.1.tar.gz
wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/nagiosplug/nagios-plugins-2.1.3.tar.gz

```

#### 3) Compile and Install Nagios Core

Extract the Nagios Core source code tarball.

```

cd ~/downloads
tar xzf nagios-4.2.1.tar.gz
cd nagios-4.2.1

```

Run the Nagios configure script, passing the name of the group you created earlier like so:

```

./configure --with-command-group=nagcmd

```

Compile the Nagios Core source code.

```

make all

```

Install binaries, init script, sample config files and set permissions on the external command directory.

```

make install
make install-init
make install-config
make install-commandmode

```

Don't start Nagios Core yet - there's still more that needs to be done...

#### 4) Customize Configuration

Sample [configuration files](config.html) have now been installed in the */usr/local/nagios/etc* directory. These sample files should work fine for getting started with Nagios Core. You'll need to make just one change before you proceed ...

Edit the */usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg* config file with your favorite editor and change the email address associated with the *nagiosadmin* contact definition to the address you'd like to use for receiving alerts.

```

vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg

```

#### 5) Configure the Web Interface

Install the Nagios Core web config file in the Apache conf.d directory.

```

make install-webconf

```

Create a *nagiosadmin* account for logging into the Nagios Core web interface. Remember the password you assign to this account - you'll need it later.

```

htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin

```

Restart Apache to make the new settings take effect.

```

/etc/init.d/apache2 reload

```

 **Note**: Consider implementing the ehanced CGI security measures described [here](cgisecurity.html) to ensure that your web authentication credentials are not compromised.

#### 6) Compile and Install the Nagios Plugins

Extract the Nagios plugins source code tarball.

```

cd ~/downloads
tar xzf nagios-plugins-2.1.3.tar.gz
cd nagios-plugins-2.1.3

```

Compile and install the plugins.

```

./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios
make
make install

```

#### 7) Start Nagios Core

Configure Nagios Core to automatically start when the system boots.

```

ln -s /etc/init.d/nagios /etc/rcS.d/S99nagios

```

Verify the sample Nagios Core configuration files.

```

/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

```

If there are no errors, start Nagios Core.

```

/etc/init.d/nagios start

```

#### 8) Login to the Web Interface

You should now be able to access the Nagios Core web interface at the URL below. You'll be prompted for the username (*nagiosadmin*) and password you specified earlier.

```

http://localhost/nagios/

```

Click on the "Service Detail" navbar link to see details of what's being monitored on your local machine. It will take a few minutes for Nagios Core to check all the services associated with your machine, as the checks are spread out over time.

#### 9) Other Modifications

If you want to receive email notifications for Nagios Core alerts, you need to install the mailx (Postfix) package.

```

sudo apt-get install mailx
sudo apt-get install postfix

```

You'll have to edit the Nagios Core email notification commands found in */usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg* and change any '/bin/mail' references to '/usr/bin/mail'. Once you do that you'll need to restart Nagios Core to make the configuration changes live.

```

sudo /etc/init.d/nagios restart

```

Configuring email notifications is outside the scope of this documentation. Refer to your system documentation, search the web, or look to the [Nagios Support Portal](https://support.nagios.com) or [Nagios Community Wiki](http://wiki.nagios.org) for specific instructions on configuring your Ubuntu system to send email messages to external addresses.

#### 10) You're Done

Congratulations! You sucessfully installed Nagios Core. Your journey into monitoring is just beginning. You'll no doubt want to monitor more than just your local machine, so check out the following docs ...
