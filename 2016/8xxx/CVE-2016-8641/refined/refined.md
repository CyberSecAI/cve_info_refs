    "bugzilla.redhat.com_e25bf1d1_20250125_123423.html": {
      "Root cause": "Insecure file ownership change in `daemon-init.in` during file creation.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The Nagios startup script, run by root, insecurely gives ownership of files to the nagios user using `chown` after creating them with `touch`.",
        "This allows a local attacker to create symbolic links before the files are created."
      ],
      "Impact": "Local privilege escalation by gaining ownership of arbitrary files.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local attacker creates symlinks to files they don't have access to, before Nagios creates the files. When nagios init script runs it changes the ownership to the nagios user, granting them access.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the system as the `nagios` user or with the ability to create symlinks in the target directory before the Nagios daemon starts"

        "Nagios init script uses `touch` to create files then insecurely changes ownership of these files using `chown` to nagios user.",
