Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8905:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `sort` parameter in the `JSONTags` servlet. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into a SQL query without sufficient sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL command execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
- Potential data exfiltration: By crafting specific SQL queries, an attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database.
- Data manipulation: It might also be possible to modify or delete data.
- Information disclosure: Even if direct data extraction is not feasible (due to the nature of the "order by" injection), it could still be possible to glean information through boolean-based blind SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/JSONTags` servlet, where the `sort` parameter contains malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the dotCMS application. This is in contrast to CVE-2016-8902 which does not require authentication.
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the dotCMS application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is the "sort" parameter in the `/JSONTags` servlet.
- The vulnerability exists in dotCMS versions before 3.3.1.
- The `sort` parameter is used within an SQL `ORDER BY` clause. Since SQL `ORDER BY` clauses do not support parameterized queries, it appears to be directly concatenated into an SQL query.
- Proof-of-Concept URL: `/JSONTags?start=0&count=10&sort=tagname SQLi` (where `SQLi` is an SQL injection payload).
- A more specific proof of concept for a blind SQL injection can be constructed as such: `/JSONTags?start=0&count=10&sort=keywords LIMIT (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1 ELSE -1 END)--` which would evaluate to true, and  `/JSONTags?start=0&count=10&sort=keywords LIMIT (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=0) THEN 1 ELSE -1 END)--` would evaluate to false.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in dotCMS version 3.3.1.
- The vulnerability was initially reported on 2015-12-14.
- This vulnerability is part of a series of SQL injection vulnerabilities discovered in dotCMS.
- The issue was addressed with sanitization of input parameters.
