- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Moxa AWK-3131A web application uses a single nonce for all session authentication requests. The nonce only changes after 300 seconds of web application inactivity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Nonce reuse:** The web application reuses the same nonce for multiple session authentication requests. This simplifies attacks against the session token because the attacker only needs to crack MD5(password), as the nonce is fixed.
    - **Session invalidation:** When a user logs out, the session token is cleared from the cookie, but the session remains valid until the 300-second timeout occurs. An attacker who obtained the session token can log in even after the user logged out.
    - **Perpetual session:** An attacker can keep a session token valid indefinitely by ensuring the web application never goes idle, thus preventing the nonce from changing.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized access to the device's web application.
    - Potential for an attacker to maintain a persistent session, even after a legitimate user has logged out.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based attack.
    - An attacker needs to obtain a valid session token.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to send requests to the web application of the Moxa device.
    - The attacker should obtain a session token to use it after the user has logged out or to maintain the validity of the session.
