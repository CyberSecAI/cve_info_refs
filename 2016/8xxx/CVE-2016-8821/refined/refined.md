Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for the `DxgkDdiEscape` function. Specifically, improper access controls exist within the handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Improper Access Controls:** The primary weakness is that the driver does not enforce adequate access controls, allowing a user to interact with the `DxgkDdiEscape` function in an unintended way.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Escalation of Privileges:**  By exploiting this vulnerability, a regular user can gain the ability to access arbitrary physical memory which can lead to the ability to gain escalated privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The vulnerability is triggered through the `DxgkDdiEscape` function in the kernel-mode display driver, indicating a local attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
* The attacker must be able to interact with the display driver through the `DxgkDdiEscape` function. The content also specifies that only a low-privileged user needs to be able to call the `DxgkDdiEscape` function which the system does not properly secure.
