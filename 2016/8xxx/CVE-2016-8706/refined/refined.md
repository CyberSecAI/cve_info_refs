{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An integer overflow in the `process_bin_sasl_auth` function, which handles SASL authentication messages, can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, the body length and key length from the authentication command are used to calculate the allocation size. If the body length is less than the key length, an integer overflow occurs, resulting in a negative or small size value. This leads to a heap buffer overflow when copying the key during item allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause the memcached server to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted SASL authentication message.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack",
      "Sending specially crafted SASL authentication message via memcached binary protocol."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted SASL authentication message to the memcached server, which requires network connectivity. The server also needs to be compiled with SASL authentication enabled, which is not the default setting."
