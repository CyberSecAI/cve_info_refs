- **Root cause of vulnerability:** In non-default configurations, IBM Integration Bus could allow a remote user to authenticate without providing valid credentials. This occurs when web user accounts are authenticated against an LDAP server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication. It allows remote users to bypass authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can gain unauthorized access by authenticating without providing valid credentials. The impact is high in terms of Integrity, although Confidentiality and Availability remain unaffected.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable IBM Integration Bus service over the network. They do not need prior knowledge of valid user credentials. The attack requires a non-default configuration.
