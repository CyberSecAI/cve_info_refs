Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape`. Specifically, the driver returns a handle to a kernel object directly to the user without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Kernel Object Handle Leak:** The primary weakness is that a handle to a kernel object is returned to user-mode. This is a violation of kernel object security model.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:**  An attacker could potentially use the leaked kernel object handle to cause a denial of service.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The leaked handle might be leveraged to escalate privileges by accessing kernel resources that should not be accessible from user mode.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.  An attacker with local access to the system can trigger the vulnerable code path within the driver via the `DxgkDdiEscape` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the target Windows system.
- The attacker also needs the ability to communicate with the NVIDIA GPU display driver through the `DxgkDdiEscape` interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- This content provides more specific details than the basic CVE description.
- The CVSS score is 8.8, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects all NVIDIA GPU products on Windows.
- A fix is available in the driver versions mentioned in the bulletin.
