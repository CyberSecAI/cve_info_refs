- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing file paths. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize special elements in the pathname, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can download arbitrary files from the target system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation via the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific privileges are required (unauthenticated).
