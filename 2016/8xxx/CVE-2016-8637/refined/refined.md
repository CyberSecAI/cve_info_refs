Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8637:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how `dracut` creates initramfs images when the "early cpio" feature is enabled, particularly when microcode updates are included.
- The script uses `cpio` to create the initial part of the initramfs image and then appends more data later, without setting proper file permissions before the initial write operation. Specifically, it does not set `umask 077` before the first cpio operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure file permissions:** The initramfs image is created with world-readable permissions if the early cpio is used, because the file creation occurs before `umask` is set. The subsequent writes use the same permission as the initially created file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local information disclosure:** A local attacker could read the initramfs file and extract sensitive information such as encryption keys, network storage credentials, and other confidential data stored within it.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable initramfs is generated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system to read the world-readable initramfs file.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in the following code snippet:

```
if [[ $create_early_cpio = yes ]]; then
    echo 1 > "$early_cpio_dir/d/early_cpio"
    # The microcode blob is _before_ the initramfs blob, not after
    (cd "$early_cpio_dir/d";     find . -print0 | cpio --null
$cpio_owner_root -H newc -o --quiet > $outfile)
fi
if ! ( umask 077; cd "$initdir"; find . -print0 | cpio --null
$cpio_owner_root -H newc -o --quiet | \
    $compress >> "$outfile"; ); then
    dfatal "dracut: creation of $outfile failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

The first `cpio` command (when `$create_early_cpio` is yes) creates the `$outfile` without `umask 077` applied, resulting in world-readable permissions by default. The second `cpio` command appends to the same file after applying `umask 077` but does not change the permissions on the already created file.

**Fix:**

The fix ensures that the `umask 077` is applied before the creation of the initramfs file. The upstream fix is available here: `https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/commit/0db98910a11c12a454eac4c8e86dc7a7bbc764a4`. It consists of making the file creation atomic by creating a temporary file, setting the `umask` before writing to it, and then copying the completed image.

This commit adds `umask 077` before the first cpio operation when `create_early_cpio` is enabled, preventing the creation of world readable files.
