    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `process_bin_append_prepend` function of memcached when processing multiple commands of the binary protocol.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit the integer overflow leading to a heap buffer overflow which can result in a denial of service (crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted memcached binary protocol message",
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger this vulnerability. Requires the memcached service to be exposed and using the binary protocol."
