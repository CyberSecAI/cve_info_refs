```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver (nvlddmkm.sys) does not validate a user-provided size value before using it in a memcpy operation. Specifically, the DxgkDdiEscape handler for ID 0x10000e9.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack buffer overflow due to missing bounds check on user-controlled size parameter passed to memcpy.
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (BSOD) or potential escalation of privileges by overwriting stack memory.
- Attack vectors: A local attacker with low privileges can send a crafted ioctl escape code with a malicious size parameter to the vulnerable driver.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Local access to the machine with the ability to send IOCTLs to the graphics driver.
