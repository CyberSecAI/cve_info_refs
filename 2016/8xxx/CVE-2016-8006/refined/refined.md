- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The McAfee SIEM system improperly validates user authentication responses. By manipulating the server response, an attacker can bypass authentication checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass vulnerability. Specifically, the application fails to properly verify the authentication response, allowing an attacker to modify the response to achieve successful authentication without providing valid credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious administrative user can make changes to other SIEM user information, including passwords, and can execute GUI "Terminal" commands on an active logged-in admin user without providing the logged-in admin password a second time. This could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves intercepting and manipulating the HTTP response during the authentication process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify HTTP responses between the client (McAfee SIEM GUI) and the server. They also need to have some level of access to the system to make initial API calls.
