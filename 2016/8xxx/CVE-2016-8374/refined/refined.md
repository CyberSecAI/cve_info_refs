- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled resource consumption in the web server component of Schneider Electric Magelis HMI products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Two instances of CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. One allows an attacker to open multiple connections to a web server, preventing new connections, effectively causing a denial of service. The second instance allows an attacker to disrupt the web server also causing denial of service. The primary difference is the first can be addressed without a reboot in newer firmware.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service (DoS) for affected devices. Devices with older firmware require a reboot to regain operation.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation via network connections to the vulnerable web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low skill, capable of establishing network connections to the web server is able to exploit the vulnerability.
