      "root_cause": "The CAPTCHA code is stored in the session and is not invalidated after being used. The code is only renewed when the /Captcha.jpg image is reloaded from the server. If the image is not reloaded, the previous valid CAPTCHA code can be reused until the session expires.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Session management vulnerability",
        "Improper CAPTCHA validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass the CAPTCHA protection mechanism by reusing a valid CAPTCHA code within the same session, enabling automated attacks. For example, this can allow mass spam using the /sendEmail/ service.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to obtain a valid CAPTCHA initially (by manually completing one). Then they must identify the session ID (JSESSIONID) and reuse that value in subsequent requests along with the valid CAPTCHA code obtained. This can be performed via a POST request to the affected resource (e.g. /dotCMS/sendEmail).",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to manually interact with the application to obtain an initial valid CAPTCHA, and then needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a specific cookie and the valid CAPTCHA code. No authentication is required."
