The provided content is a security advisory from Huawei regarding multiple input validation vulnerabilities in their smartphones. This advisory includes CVE-2016-8793 as one of the affected vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is due to input validation issues present in some Huawei smartphones. The specific nature of the input validation flaws is not detailed, but it is implied that sending crafted parameters to the phone can trigger the issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Input validation vulnerabilities exist in Huawei smartphone software.
- The vulnerabilities can be triggered by specific parameters sent to the smartphone.
- It is not specified in which components of the OS, the input validation is missing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- System crash (Denial of Service).
- Privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
