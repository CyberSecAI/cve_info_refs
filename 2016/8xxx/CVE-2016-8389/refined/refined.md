The provided content is related to CVE-2016-8389.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow when calculating buffer size for rasterizing polygon shapes from a PDF font.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Integer overflow: The product of two values used to determine the buffer size can overflow, resulting in a smaller-than-required buffer allocation.
*   Heap-based buffer overflow: When writing to the undersized buffer during polygon rasterization, a heap buffer overflow occurs due to missing bounds check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Code execution: Overwriting the heap can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user running the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Malicious PDF: Exploitation requires a crafted PDF file with specific characteristics to trigger the integer overflow.
*   File Conversion: The vulnerability occurs during the conversion of a PDF file to XML/HTML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Attacker needs to provide a malicious PDF file to the vulnerable software.
*   No special privileges are required for exploitation besides the ability to supply a PDF for conversion.
