- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Moxa AWK-3131A Wireless Access Point has an undocumented, privileged (root) account with hard-coded credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of hard-coded credentials for a privileged account. The device lacks the functionality for legitimate administrators to modify or remove the backdoor account.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers gain full control of the affected devices due to having root access via the hardcoded credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has network access to the device and can use the hardcoded credentials to log in.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device and must know the hard-coded username (`94jo3dkru4`) and password (`moxaiwroot`).
