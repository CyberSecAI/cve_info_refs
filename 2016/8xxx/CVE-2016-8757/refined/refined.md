Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerabilities are due to the lack of memory initialization during memory allocation within the ION memory management module of Huawei smartphones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** Two distinct information leak vulnerabilities exist (HWPSIRT-2016-09032 and HWPSIRT-2016-09033). The lack of initialization of allocated memory can lead to exposure of sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to obtain sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application on the targeted smartphone. This suggests a local attack vector requiring user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to create and deploy a malicious application on the target Huawei smartphone. This requires the ability to get the user to install and execute this application. The attacker does not require physical access, but a certain level of social engineering or user interaction is required.

**CVSS v2 Metrics:**

*   **Base Score:** 1.9 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
    *   **AV:L (Access Vector: Local):** The attack requires local access to the vulnerable device.
    *   **AC:M (Access Complexity: Medium):** Exploitation is not straightforward and requires some level of skill.
    *   **Au:N (Authentication: None):** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
    *  **C:P (Confidentiality: Partial):** Some confidential information may be disclosed.
    *  **I:N (Integrity: None):** The vulnerability does not impact data integrity.
    *   **A:N (Availability: None):** The vulnerability does not impact service availability.
*  **Temporal Score:** 1.5 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)
    *   **E:F (Exploitability: Functional):** A working exploit exists.
    *   **RL:O (Remediation Level: Official Fix):** A complete vendor solution exists.
    *   **RC:C (Report Confidence: Confirmed):** The vulnerability has been confirmed and is not theoretical.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities are addressed in software updates for specific Huawei P9 models.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by researchers from the University of California, Riverside.
*   Huawei recommends users update their devices to the patched versions.
