- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `serviceAgent` functionality of the Moxa AWK-3131A Wireless Access Point does not require authentication and communicates in cleartext. A specially crafted TCP query to the serviceAgent can be used to retrieve sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure, lack of authentication, cleartext communication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve potentially sensitive information such as firmware version and other device details that may be of value for further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted TCP query to the `serviceAgent` running on port 5801. This can be done through freely available tools or custom scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to port 5801 of the Moxa device. No authentication is required. The attacker can be on the same network as the device.
