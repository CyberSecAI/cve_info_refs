- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `value` parameter of the `/ossim/dashboard/sections/widgets/data/gauge.php` script, specifically on line 231. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing a serialized array.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The application accepts a serialized array with a SQL query in the type field, leading to arbitrary SQL query execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Reading sensitive data (e.g., user password hashes, content of any file accessible to the MySQL user)
    - Modifying or deleting data
    - Other database-related attacks
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/ossim/dashboard/sections/widgets/data/gauge.php` with a specific serialized array in the `value` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They can then send crafted requests containing malicious SQL queries.
