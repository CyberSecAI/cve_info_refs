Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8659:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the `bubblewrap` program's use of the `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` flag, combined with a privilege separation mechanism that involves a socket and a child process that drops privileges. The `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` flag makes the process's memory accessible through `ptrace`, even after it drops privileges. This, combined with the fact that a privsep socket remains open and is used for inter-process communication, allows an attacker to attach to this process after it becomes unprivileged and inject commands through the socket.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unnecessary use of `PR_SET_DUMPABLE`:** `bubblewrap` sets the `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` flag, which allows for attaching to the process with `ptrace`. This is done so that it can access `/proc/self/uid_map`, but the program does not reset this flag later.
2.  **Privilege separation socket:** A socket is created for communication between the privileged parent process and an unprivileged child process. After the child process drops privileges, it continues to receive and execute commands from the socket.
3.  **Lack of proper checks:** The `sethostname()` operation, which is accessible through the socket, is not restricted to a UTS namespace, allowing an attacker to modify the hostname of the entire system, not just the sandboxed environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:

1.  **Gain arbitrary code execution:** By attaching to the process with `ptrace`, the attacker can inject commands into the privsep socket.
2.  **Modify the system hostname:**  The `sethostname()` operation can be used to change the system's hostname. This can then be used to further compromise the system by leveraging PS expansion bugs in bash when other users log in.
3. **Local Privilege Escalation:** By modifying the system hostname, an attacker can escalate privileges by exploiting other vulnerabilities triggered by the hostname change.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Local access:** An attacker needs local access to the system to attach to the vulnerable `bubblewrap` process using `ptrace`.
2.  **`ptrace` attachment:**  The attacker uses `ptrace` to attach to the `bubblewrap` process after it has dropped privileges.
3.  **Socket communication:** The attacker sends commands through the privsep socket to trigger actions within the `bubblewrap` process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the system.
2.  **`ptrace` access:** The attacker needs the ability to use `ptrace`.
3. **Timing:** The attacker needs to attach to the process after `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` is set, but before the process exits.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported on the `oss-security` mailing list by Sebastian Krahmer.
*   Simon McVittie confirmed the vulnerability and proposed a fix to avoid setting hostname in the original namespace if `--unshare-uts` option is not set.
* The issue was assigned CVE-2016-8659 and was tracked as issue #107 on the bubblewrap github repo.
