Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-8444:

**Vulnerability:** Elevation of privilege in the Qualcomm camera driver.

**Root Cause:**  A vulnerability within the Qualcomm camera driver allows a malicious application, that has already compromised a privileged process, to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The core issue is an exploitable flaw in the Qualcomm camera driver.
- Requires a prior compromise of a privileged process

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the kernel.
-  This could lead to a local permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Local malicious application.
-  Exploitation requires prior compromise of a privileged process

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to have the ability to install a malicious application on the device.
-   The attacker would first need to compromise a privileged process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The patch for this issue is not publicly available and is included in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices.
- This vulnerability is listed as "High" severity because it first requires a prior compromise of a privileged process, and because of the potential for kernel-level code execution.
- Affected devices include Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, and Nexus 6P.
- The vulnerability was reported on Aug 26, 2016
