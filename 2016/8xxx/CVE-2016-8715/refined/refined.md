- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `loadTrailer` function of Iceni Argus PDF processing, specifically in how it handles the 'Size' field within the PDF trailer. A crafted PDF with a negative or large value for 'Size' can cause `icnChainAlloc` to not allocate sufficient memory, leading to a heap overflow in subsequent memory operations, specifically in memset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap overflow exists due to an integer handling issue when parsing the Size field in the PDF trailer. The `icnChainAlloc` function doesn't handle the case when the requested allocation size is larger than the maximum value of a signed integer, leading to an undersized memory allocation. Following this the memset function writes out-of-bounds, leading to the overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution due to the heap corruption caused by the overflow in memset operation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file that has a negative value or other large value which results in an integer overflow in `icnChainAlloc`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send or provide the malicious PDF file to the vulnerable software for processing. No special capabilities or elevated privileges are required.
