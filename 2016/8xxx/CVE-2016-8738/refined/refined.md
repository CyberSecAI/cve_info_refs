Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `URLValidator` in Apache Struts. Specifically, a specially crafted URL can cause excessive processing when the validator attempts to validate it, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inefficient URL validation logic in `URLValidator`.
- Lack of proper input sanitization or length limitations when handling URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by overloading the server with complex URL validation requests. This can render the application unavailable or severely degrade its performance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends a malicious or specially crafted URL via a form field that uses the built-in `URLValidator`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data to a form field that is validated using the vulnerable `URLValidator` within the Apache Struts application. No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Struts versions 2.5 to 2.5.12.
- The provided workaround is to trim the passed URL value before assigning it to a field to remove any leading or trailing spaces that could be part of the attack.
- The recommended fix is to upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.5.13 or higher, which contains a patch for this vulnerability.
- NetApp also mentions the vulnerability, stating that successful exploitation could lead to DoS, and assigns a medium CVSS score of 5.9. They also list products affected by the vulnerability.
