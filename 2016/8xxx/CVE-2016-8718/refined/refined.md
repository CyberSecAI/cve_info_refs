- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Moxa AWK-3131A Web Application does not properly validate requests, leading to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. A specially crafted form can trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a legitimate user into performing any action permitted by the device, including modifying device settings or exploiting other vulnerabilities such as OS Command Injection vulnerabilities to execute operating system commands with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** By tricking a user's browser to send a malicious request to the vulnerable web application. This can be done by embedding a malicious form on a webpage, which when opened by a user logged in to the device's web interface will trigger the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user logged into the device's web interface to visit a malicious page containing the crafted form. The attacker does not need prior access to the device, but the user needs to be authenticated to the web interface of the vulnerable device.
