- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper management of system resources in Huawei switches.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A remote attacker with specific permission can store massive files, which leads to the exhaustion of shared storage space on the device.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the exhaustion of system storage space.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to log in to the device as a specific user with the required permission to store files.
