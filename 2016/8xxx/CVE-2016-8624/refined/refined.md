{
  "CVE-2016-8624": {
    "Root cause": "curl doesn't parse the authority component of the URL correctly when the host name part ends with a '#' character.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Invalid URL parsing"
    ],
    "Impact": "Could be tricked into connecting to a different host, potentially leading to security implications if URL parsing is used to check allowed domains.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a URL with a '#' character in the hostname part.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a URL to an application using a vulnerable curl library."
