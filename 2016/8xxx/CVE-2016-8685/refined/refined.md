Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8685:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an invalid memory access within the `findnext` function in `decompose.c` of potrace. The program attempts to access memory at an invalid address, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Invalid Memory Access:** The core issue is an attempt to read or write to a memory location that is not allocated or is otherwise invalid. This is a common type of memory safety vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The immediate impact is a crash of the `potrace` application, resulting in a denial of service. The program terminates abruptly when encountering the invalid memory access.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, such vulnerabilities can sometimes be exploited for more severe impacts, such as arbitrary code execution, if the attacker has more control over the memory access. This specific case appears to be a straightforward crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Image:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted image as input to the `potrace` utility.
- **Fuzzing:** The vulnerability was discovered through fuzz testing, where the application is subjected to a large amount of random or semi-random input in order to find weaknesses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input to potrace:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious input to the `potrace` application. This likely involves command-line access or through some other means of input to the vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `src/decompose.c`, line 436.
- The AddressSanitizer output shows the crash occurring in the `findnext` function.
- The vulnerable version is 1.13 and the fix is included in version 1.14.
- The bug was found using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)
