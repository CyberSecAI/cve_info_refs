{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing HTTP responses, allowing for control over HTTP headers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "HTTP Response Splitting",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can manipulate the HTTP response, potentially leading to various attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious scripts in the response, or cache poisoning.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters (%0d%0a) into parameters within the HTTP request, the attacker can insert arbitrary headers or manipulate the body of the response.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. This requires network access to the target system."
