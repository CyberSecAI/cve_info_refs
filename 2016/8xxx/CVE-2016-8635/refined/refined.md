{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange handling within NSS, where client DH keys could be confined to small subgroups of the desired group.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is a small subgroup confinement attack vulnerability. This is related to the fact that the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism was not properly validating if the keys were on small subgroups.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to recover the private key of a client by confining the client's Diffie-Hellman key to a small subgroup of the intended group.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating the Diffie-Hellman key exchange process by confining the client's key to a small subgroup.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be in a position to intercept or manipulate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange between a client and server, such as being a man-in-the-middle. The attacker must also be able to control the key material used in the DH exchange by the victim."
