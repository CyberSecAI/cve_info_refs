Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak or broken cryptographic algorithm when transmitting passwords to the Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC-Q series PLC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm:** The system employs inadequate encryption for passwords transmitted to the PLC, allowing interception and decryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to intercept weakly encrypted passwords.
*   This could lead to unauthorized access and control of the PLC.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected MELSEC-Q series Ethernet interface module.
*   **Low Skill:** The vulnerability is considered easily exploitable, requiring low attacker skill.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that exploits are publicly available.
*   Mitsubishi Electric has released a product revision (for newer devices with serial numbers 18072 and later) with IP filtering to reduce the risk of exploitation for the mentioned vulnerabilities.
*   The cryptographic algorithm vulnerability itself will not be addressed with the IP filter implementation, requiring additional security measures.
* The advisory recommends mitigations, such as using firewalls, IPsec, VPNs, and bump-in-the-wire solutions, to secure affected systems.
