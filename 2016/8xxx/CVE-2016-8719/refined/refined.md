- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the web application of the Moxa AWK-3131A device. Specifically, the `devIndex` parameter in `client_list.asp` and `multiple_ssid_set.asp`, the `index` parameter in `wireless_cert.asp`, and the `vapIndex` parameter in `wireless_security.asp` are vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing session tokens
    - Impersonating legitimate users
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads within vulnerable parameters. These URLs are then sent to the victim, who must be authenticated to the web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a valid user into accessing it while authenticated to the Moxa AWK-3131A device's web interface.
