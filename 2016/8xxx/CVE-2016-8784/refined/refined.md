- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The LDP processing module in some Huawei products does not properly release memory when handling specific LDP packets with abnormal parameter values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause memory leaks on the targeted device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted LDP packets with specific abnormal parameter values to the targeted device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -  The attacker must have access to the LAN side of the device.
    -  The MPLS function of the device must be enabled, and the device must be able to receive and handle LDP packets at the access site.
