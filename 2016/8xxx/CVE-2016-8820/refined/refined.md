- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A missing check on a function return value in the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler within the `nvlddmkm.sys` driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The lack of validation on a function return value can lead to an uninitialized value being used as the source for a `strcpy()` operation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This can result in a denial of service or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler in the kernel mode layer of the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need local access and the ability to interact with the GPU driver via the `DxgkDdiEscape` interface.
