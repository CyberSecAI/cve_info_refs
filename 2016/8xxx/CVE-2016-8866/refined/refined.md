    "Description": "The AcquireMagickMemory function in MagickCore/memory.c in ImageMagick 7.0.3.3 before 7.0.3.8 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted image, which triggers a memory allocation failure. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8862.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8862, leading to a memory allocation failure when processing a crafted image.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory allocation failure, out-of-bounds heap read.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (crash or excessive memory/CPU usage), potentially remote code execution in specific circumstances.",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing a crafted image file, likely triggered by a command-line utility like 'identify' or 'convert'.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a specially crafted image file to the vulnerable application. This can be achieved via local file access or through a network service that processes images."
