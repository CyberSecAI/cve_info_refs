Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-8219:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an over-privilege assigned to the "SpaceAuditor" role in Cloud Foundry. This role, intended for auditing purposes, was incorrectly granted the ability to restage applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is the improper assignment of permissions, allowing the SpaceAuditor role to perform actions beyond its intended scope. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege.
- **Over-privileged role:** The SpaceAuditor role had the ability to restage applications, which should have been restricted to roles with higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Downtime:**  An attacker with SpaceAuditor privileges could restage an application. If the restage fails, it could cause application downtime. This impacts the availability of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Account:** An attacker who gains access to an account with the SpaceAuditor role can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Malicious Insider:** A user with the SpaceAuditor role could intentionally trigger the restage action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **SpaceAuditor Role:** The attacker must have a valid user account with the SpaceAuditor role within the Cloud Foundry environment. This can either be achieved by compromising an existing account or by a malicious insider who was granted this role.

**More detail than the official CVE description:**
- The provided content gives explicit details on affected versions (cf-release versions prior to 250 and CAPI-release versions prior to 1.12.0) and mitigation steps (upgrading to specific versions).
- It also clarifies the specific action that is vulnerable (restaging applications) and the specific role that has the excessive privileges (SpaceAuditor), providing more context than a typical CVE description.
