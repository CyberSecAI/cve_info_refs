Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8746:

**CVE-2016-8746: Apache Ranger path matching issue in policy evaluation**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Apache Ranger policy engine incorrectly matches paths in certain conditions. Specifically, when a policy does not contain wildcards and the recursion flag is set to true.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect path matching logic in the policy evaluation engine.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability could cause policies to be applied to resources where they should not be applied, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by how the policy engine interprets path specifications when recursion is enabled without the use of wildcards.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to define or manipulate Ranger policies with specific configurations (recursion flag set to true, no wildcards). Access to the policy admin tool is required.
