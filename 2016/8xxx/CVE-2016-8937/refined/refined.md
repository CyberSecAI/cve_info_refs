- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Information is disclosed during authentication, making the system vulnerable to an offline dictionary attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the authentication process of IBM Spectrum Protect, where information is exposed that can be used to perform an offline dictionary attack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full access to the IBM Spectrum Protect system. This level of access enables the attacker to perform operations that they would otherwise be unauthorized to perform, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves capturing and analyzing authentication-related information disclosed during the login process. This captured information can then be used in an offline dictionary attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the capability to intercept or obtain the exposed authentication information. They would also need the ability to conduct offline dictionary attacks.
