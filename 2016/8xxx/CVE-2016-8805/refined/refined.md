Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check within the inner loop of the escape handler for `DxgkDdiEscape` ID `0x7000014` in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver. User-controlled data is used to index an array without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow due to missing bounds check on a user-controlled size variable.
- Use of user-provided data as an index without prior validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The stack buffer overflow can cause the driver to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Potential Escalation of Privileges: Overwriting data on the stack could potentially allow a malicious user to gain control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted input to the driver through the `DxgkDdiEscape` interface with ID `0x7000014`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the NVIDIA driver and issue `DxgkDdiEscape` calls.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located within the `nvlddmkm.sys` driver, which is the kernel-mode component of the NVIDIA display driver.
- The vulnerability occurs when handling the `DxgkDdiEscape` ID `0x7000014`.
- The code uses a nested loop where the inner loop iterates based on user-controlled `size`, and writes into a stack buffer, `stack_buf[j]`.
- Lack of validation of `size` allows an attacker to write beyond the bounds of `stack_buf`, leading to a stack buffer overflow.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Google Project Zero.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) causes a system crash with a `DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER` error.
- The vulnerability is present in NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Drivers across different products (Quadro, NVS, Tesla, GeForce, GRID).
- The fix is included in driver versions 375.63 (R375) and later, and other specific versions based on driver branch.
