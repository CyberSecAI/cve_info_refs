Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Ecava IntegraXor web server contains parameters vulnerable to SQL injection. The lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied inputs allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL injection (CWE-89) vulnerability exists within the web server of Ecava IntegraXor.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Arbitrary data leakage: Attackers can read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Data manipulation: Attackers can modify or corrupt data within the database.
    *   Remote code execution: Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). It involves sending specially crafted web requests to the vulnerable server.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N) to perform the attack. It can be done remotely, and requires low skill level to exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected version is IntegraXor Version 5.0.413.0.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in IntegraXor version V5.2.722.2
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 7.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
*   The vulnerability was identified by independent researchers Brian Gorenc and Juan Pablo Lopez working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
*   The affected software is used in critical infrastructure sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and Transportation Systems.
