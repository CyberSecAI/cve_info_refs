  "CVE-2016-8687": {
    "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the safe_fprintf function in tar/util.c in libarchive 3.2.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted non-printable multibyte character in a filename.",
    "root_cause": "Miscalculations in the safe_fprintf() function. Specifically, the function did not properly handle the expansion of non-printable multibyte characters, leading to a stack buffer overflow when writing output to the buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Improper handling of multibyte characters",
      "Insufficient buffer size for expanded output"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash). Though there is some mitigation via compiler flags, a crash can still happen, making the impact a denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted archive file with non-printable multibyte character in the filename."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker needs to entice a user to open the specially crafted archive file."
    ],
      "details": "The vulnerability is triggered during the conversion of non-printable multibyte characters to C-style ASCII escapes, the function expands these characters into a format like \"\\123\", resulting in >20 characters for each multibyte characters with length > 5 which can exceed the allocated buffer. The safe_fprintf() function in libarchive 3.2.1 was identified as the vulnerable code. The issue was found using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)."
