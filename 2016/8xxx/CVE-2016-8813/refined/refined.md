- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape` uses multiple pointers without checking for NULL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing NULL pointer checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service or potential escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs within the kernel mode layer via the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access with low privileges. The vulnerability can be triggered without user interaction.
