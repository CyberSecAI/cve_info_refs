  "cve": "CVE-2016-8750",
  "description": "Apache Karaf uses the LDAPLoginModule to authenticate users to a directory via LDAP. However, it is not encoding usernames properly and hence is vulnerable to LDAP injection attacks. While it appears that it not possible to exploit this vulnerability to allow an attacker to gain remote access, it allows an attacker to insert special characters into the search query step. Therefore, it can potentially be exploited as part of a Denial Of Service attack.",
  "affected_versions": "all versions of Apache Karaf prior to 4.0.8",
  "root_cause": "The LDAPLoginModule in Apache Karaf does not properly encode usernames when constructing LDAP queries.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "LDAP injection"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can insert special characters into the search query step, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
    "By providing a specially crafted username during authentication, an attacker can inject malicious LDAP syntax into the search query.",
     "Exploitation requires an interface where user input is passed to the authentication process."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the system.",
   "additional_information": "The vulnerability does not allow for remote access, but can be used for Denial of Service attacks by crafting special characters in the username."
