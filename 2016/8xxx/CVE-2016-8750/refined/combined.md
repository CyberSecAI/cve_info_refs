-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
CVE-2016-8750: Apache Karaf's LDAPLoginModule is vulnerable to LDAP
injection
Severity: Moderate
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected:
This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache Karaf prior to 4.0.8
Description:
Apache Karaf uses the LDAPLoginModule to authenticate users to a directory
via LDAP. However, it is not encoding usernames properly and hence is
vulnerable to LDAP injection attacks.
While it appears that it not possible to exploit this vulnerability to allow
an attacker to gain remote access, it allows an attacker to insert special
characters into the search query step. Therefore, it can potentially be
exploited as part of a Denial Of Service attack.
This has been fixed in revision:
https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.git;h=ac07cb2
Migration:
Apache Karaf users should upgrade to 4.0.8 or later as soon as possible.
Credit: This issue was reported by Colm O hEigeartaigh of Talend.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1524432#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-12-11 13:47:48 UTC  ```  Apache Karaf uses the LDAPLoginModule to authenticate users to a directory via LDAP. However, it is not encoding usernames properly and hence is vulnerable to LDAP injection attacks.  While it appears that it not possible to exploit this vulnerability to allow an attacker to gain remote access, it allows an attacker to insert special characters into the search query step. Therefore, it can potentially be exploited as part of a Denial Of Service attack.
