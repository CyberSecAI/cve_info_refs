  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of sanitization of the User-Agent header during the login process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed when a user mouses over the User-Agent field in the 'Current Sessions' settings page, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities. The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker could steal session IDs.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the User-Agent header of the login process. The attacker injects the malicious script into this header.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make a login attempt with a crafted User-Agent header."
