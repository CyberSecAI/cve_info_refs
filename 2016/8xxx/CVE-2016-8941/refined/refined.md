- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to CSRF, allowing an attacker to execute unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially perform malicious actions on the application by tricking a user into unknowingly sending a request to the server. This can lead to unauthorized modifications or actions within the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out by an attacker exploiting the trust between a user's browser and the application server by sending malicious requests through a user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that will be sent by a user while they are logged in to the application. This does not require the attacker to have prior authentication on the application.
