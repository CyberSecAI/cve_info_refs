{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Synaptics touchscreen driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to local privilege escalation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution within the kernel context. This could result in a local permanent device compromise that may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local malicious application exploiting the Synaptics touchscreen driver."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the target device. Exploitation requires that a privileged process is first compromised."
    ]
