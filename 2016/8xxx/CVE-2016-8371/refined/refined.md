Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2016-8371 is an **authentication bypass** vulnerability in the web server of Phoenix Contact's ILC PLCs. The web server can be accessed without requiring authentication, even when the authentication mechanism is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the intended authentication mechanism, allowing unauthorized access to the web server. This is a critical flaw that undermines the security of the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can access the HMI (Human-Machine Interface) pages on the PLC without authentication. This could expose sensitive information or allow manipulation of the system.
*   **Modification of PLC Variables:** The vulnerability allows modification of PLC variables, potentially disrupting industrial processes, causing damage, or creating unsafe conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely over a network, likely via HTTP requests to the web server on the PLC.
*   **Network Access Required**: An attacker needs to have network access to the PLC's web server, directly or through an intermediary network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to reach the PLC's web interface over the network. This could mean being on the same local network or having access through a VPN or other means.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The exploit is considered relatively simple to execute, requiring low skill levels.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability is present in all ILC 1xx PLCs according to Phoenix Contact.
*   The same advisory also mentions CVE-2016-8366 related to cleartext storage of passwords, and CVE-2016-8380 related to access to critical private variable, demonstrating that the devices have multiple critical vulnerabilities.
*   The exploit from exploit-db uses HTTP requests to interact with the device.
*   Phoenix Contact has released a patch to mitigate the vulnerability in the web interface
