{
  "CVE-2016-8618": {
    "description": "The libcurl API function called `curl_maprintf()` before version 7.51.0 can be tricked into doing a double-free due to an unsafe `size_t` multiplication, on systems using 32 bit `size_t` variables.",
    "root_cause": "An unsafe size_t multiplication in the `curl_maprintf()` function on 32-bit systems, leading to a double-free.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Double-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A double-free can lead to a denial-of-service or potentially arbitrary code execution. ",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By exploiting the `curl_maprintf()` function"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a large enough input size for `curl_maprintf` to trigger the integer overflow on 32-bit systems.",
      "notes": "The vulnerability exists within the curl library's `curl_maprintf()` function. Specifically, if the function doubles an allocated memory area with `realloc()`, and the size wraps around to zero, `realloc()` returns NULL and frees the memory. libcurl then attempts to free this memory again in the error path leading to double-free condition. This vulnerability is specific to 32-bit systems, as 64-bit systems are not affected by the `size_t` wraparound."
