<https://dovecot.org/releases/2.2/dovecot-2.2.27.tar.gz>
<https://dovecot.org/releases/2.2/dovecot-2.2.27.tar.gz.sig>

Note that the download URLs are now https with a certificate from Let's Encrypt.

 * dovecot.list.index.log rotation sizes/times were changed so that
   the .log file stays smaller and .log.2 is deleted sooner.

 + Added mail_crypt plugin that allows encryption of stored emails.
   See <http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Plugins/MailCrypt>
 + stats: Global stats can be sent to Carbon server by setting
   stats_carbon_server=ip:port
 + imap/pop3 proxy: If passdb returns proxy_not_trusted, don't send
   ID/XCLIENT
 + Added generic hash modifier for %variables:
   %{<hash algorithm>;rounds=<n>,truncate=<bits>,salt=s>:field}
   Hash algorithm is any of the supported ones, e.g. md5, sha1, sha256.
   Also "pkcs5" is supported using SHA256. For example: %{sha256:user}
   or %{md5;truncate=32:user}.
 + Added support for SHA3-256 and SHA3-512 hashes.
 + config: Support DNS wildcards in local_name, e.g.
   local_name *.example.com { .. } matches anything.example.com, but
   not multiple.anything.example.com.
 + config: Support multiple names in local_name, e.g.
   local_name "1.example.com 2.example.com" { .. }
 - Fixed crash in auth process when auth-policy was configured and
   authentication was aborted/failed without a username set.
 - director: If two users had different tags but the same hash,
   the users may have been redirected to the wrong tag's hosts.
 - Index files may have been thought incorrectly lost, causing
   "Missing middle file seq=.." to be logged and index rebuild.
   This happened more easily with IMAP hibernation enabled.
 - Various fixes to restoring state correctly in un-hibernation.
 - dovecot.index files were commonly 4 bytes per email too large. This
   is because 3 bytes per email were being wasted that could have been
   used for IMAP keywords.
 - Various fixes to handle dovecot.list.index corruption better.
 - lib-fts: Fixed assert-crash in address tokenizer with specific input.
 - Fixed assert-crash in HTML to text parsing with specific input
   (e.g. for FTS indexing or snippet generation)
 - doveadm sync -1: Fixed handling mailbox GUID conflicts.
 - sdbox, mdbox: Perform full index rebuild if corruption is detected
   inside lib-index, which runs index fsck.
 - quota: Don't skip quota checks when moving mails between different
   quota roots.
 - search: Multiple sequence sets or UID sets in search parameters
   weren't handled correctly. They were incorrectly merged together.

Subject: Important vulnerability in Dovecot (CVE-2016-8652)

Important vulnerability in Dovecot (CVE-2016-8652)
CVSS score: 7.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)
Affected version(s): 2.2.25.1 up to 2.2.26.1
Fixed in: 2.2.27.1rc1

Short summary: Dovecot auth component can be crashed by remote user when
auth-policy component is activated.

If auth-policy component has been activated in Dovecot, then remote user
can use SASL authentication to crash auth component.

Workaround is to disable auth-policy component until fix is in place.
This can be done by commenting out all auth_policy_* settings.
