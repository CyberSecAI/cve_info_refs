{
  "CVE-2016-8859": {
    "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in the TRE library and musl libc allow attackers to cause memory corruption via a large number of (1) states or (2) tags, which triggers an out-of-bounds write.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflows in buffer size computations within the `tre_tnfa_run_parallel` function of the TRE regex implementation and musl libc. These overflows are caused by incorrect use of integer types and missing overflow checks when calculating the required buffer size based on the number of states and tags in a regular expression.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds Write",
       "Incorrect Data Type"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, due to out-of-bounds writes caused by insufficient buffer allocation.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a malicious regular expression and/or a crafted string to be searched that triggers the integer overflow during buffer allocation for `regexec`, leading to controlled heap corruption.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the regular expression and/or the string being searched."
  }
