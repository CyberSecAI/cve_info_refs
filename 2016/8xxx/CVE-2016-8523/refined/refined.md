```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `isDirectFileAccess` function within the `ipcelmclient.php` file. This function uses the 'command' variable in a `proc_open()` function without proper sanitization, allowing for command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the target system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, an attacker can control the 'command' variable which is used in the `proc_open()` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication may be needed as the vulnerability is triggered before authentication. If authentication is required, valid credentials or anonymous access is needed."
