- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A defense mechanism bypass vulnerability exists in Huawei USG products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the anti-DDoS module.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to bypass the anti-DDoS module and send massive HTTP packets. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the backend server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker connects to the device. Then, by exploiting the bypass, sends a large number of HTTP packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the Huawei USG device to exploit the vulnerability.
