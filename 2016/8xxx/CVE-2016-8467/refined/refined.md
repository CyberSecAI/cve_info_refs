  "additional_notes": "The provided document from securityintelligence.com provides more context and details about the exploitation of the bootloader vulnerability (CVE-2016-8467). It clarifies how the vulnerability can be triggered and how attackers can achieve their goals, such as gaining access to modem diagnostics, intercepting phone calls and SMS messages, and potentially bypassing two-factor authentication.\n\nSpecifically the following details are provided:\n* The vulnerability can be triggered by rebooting a Nexus 6 or 6P device into a custom boot mode that enables additional USB interfaces using the `fastboot` command.\n*  Attackers can use PC malware or malicious chargers to initiate the reboot into the vulnerable mode.\n* A successful attack requires ADB to be enabled, and the PC to be authorized on the device, which makes the attack vector more difficult.\n* In addition to the ADB method of triggering the vulnerability, a physical attacker could also boot the device into fastboot mode and select the vulnerable boot mode manually.\n*  The Nexus 6P is less severely impacted as modem diagnostics are disabled, but other USB interfaces such as the modem AT interface is still accessible."
