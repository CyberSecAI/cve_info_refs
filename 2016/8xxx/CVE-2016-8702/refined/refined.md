Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `bm_readbody_bmp` function within the `bitmap_io.c` file of Potrace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow:  The code attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory, causing a crash. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs at line 744 in `bitmap_io.c`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash: The primary impact is a crash of the application due to the heap-based buffer overflow.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution (not explicitly stated, but a possibility with heap overflows in general): While the provided information specifically points to a crash, it's worth noting that heap overflows can sometimes be leveraged for more severe exploits if an attacker can control the overflowed data to overwrite memory locations to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted BMP image: An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted BMP image to the `potrace` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted BMP image to the `potrace` program. This could be through direct command-line usage, or in a context where `potrace` is used to process untrusted image files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- It was fixed in version 1.13 of Potrace.
- This is one of six heap-based buffer overflows discovered in the same function, which were assigned CVE-2016-8698, CVE-2016-8699, CVE-2016-8700, CVE-2016-8701, CVE-2016-8702, and CVE-2016-8703.
