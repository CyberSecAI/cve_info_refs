  "CVE-2016-8885": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-476",
      "Description": "Multiple flaws were found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-8654, CVE-2016-9560, CVE-2016-10249, CVE-2015-5203, CVE-2015-5221, CVE-2016-1577, CVE-2016-8690, CVE-2016-8693, CVE-2016-8884, CVE-2016-8885, CVE-2016-9262, CVE-2016-9591)",
      "Versions": [
        "1.900.5"
      ]
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `bmp_getdata` function of the BMP decoder where a null pointer dereference can occur due to missing checks for the matrix parameters before being used in `jas_matrix_setv`.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Null pointer dereference vulnerability due to missing parameter checks in `jas_matrix_create` and subsequent usage in bmp_getdata."
      ],
      "Impact": "A specially crafted BMP file could cause an application using JasPer to crash due to a segmentation fault.",
      "Attack Vectors": "The attack vector involves processing a maliciously crafted BMP image file.",
      "Required Capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted BMP image file to trigger the vulnerability in an application using JasPer."
    }
