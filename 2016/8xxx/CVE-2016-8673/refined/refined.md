- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The integrated web server of affected devices lacks sufficient verification of data authenticity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient verification of data authenticity (CWE-345), leading to a vulnerability where an attacker can perform actions with the permissions of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could perform actions with the privileges of an authenticated user on the affected device. This could lead to unauthorized control, manipulation, or disruption of the industrial control system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via the integrated web server, accessible over TCP ports 80 or 443. An attacker would need to induce a user with an active session to trigger a malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device and must be able to convince a user to interact with a malicious request. They do not need to be authenticated initially, but an active session from an authenticated user is required to carry out the attack.
