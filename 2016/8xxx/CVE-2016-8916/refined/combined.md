# Security Bulletin: Password Disclosure via instrumentation log in Tivoli Storage Manager (IBM Spectrum Protect) Client (CVE-2016-8916)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

When using the "set password" Tivoli Storage Manger (IBM Spectrum Protect) client command, the full text of the command and included password is written to the instrumentation log file if instrumentation tracing is enabled. For 7.1.6.0 and higher, instrumentation tracing is enabled by default but can be disabled by using the ENABLEINSTRUMENTATION NO setting. Prior to 7.1.6.0, instrumentation tracing was enabled by using the INSTRUMENT:\* testflag.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-8916](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8916) IBM Tivoli Storage Manager stores password information in a log file that could be read by a local user when a set password command is issued.

CVSS Base Score: 5.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118472> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

The following levels of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (IBM Spectrum Protect) Client are affected:

* 7.1.0.0 through 7.1.6.4
* 6.4.0.0 through 6.4.3.4
* 6.3, 6.2, 6.1, and 5.5 all levels (these releases are EOS)

*Note that 8.1.0.0 is not affected as the fix has been included in this version.*

## Remediation/Fixes

| ***Tivoli Storage Manager Client Release*** | ***First  Fixing  VRM Level*** | ***APAR*** | ***Platform*** | ***Link to Fix / Fix Availability Target*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7.1 | 7.1.6.5 | IT17363 | AIX HP-UX Linux Macintosh Solaris Windows | Use the workaround below or upgrade to 7.1.6.5 using the following link: [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042496](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042496) |
| 6.4 | 6.4.3.5 | IT17363 | AIX HP-UX Linux Macintosh Solaris Windows | Use the workaround below or upgrade to 6.4.3.5 using the following link: [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24041144](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24041144) |
| 6.3 and below | None | None | AIX HP-UX Linux Macintosh Solaris Windows | Use the workaround below or upgrade to a fixed level (7.1.6.5 or 6.4.3.5). |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

For versions lower than 7.1.6.0:

* Examine dsm.opt (Windows) and dsm.sys (UNIX and Linux) for the presence of the INSTRUMENT:\* test flag and remove the setting.
* Scan the client machine's file systems for file names matching the pattern "dsminstr.report.\*". Either delete all of these files or delete only those files containing the set password command.

For versions 7.1.6.0 and higher:

* Examine dsm.opt (Windows) and dsm.sys (UNIX and Linux) for the presence of the ENABLEINSTRUMENTATION setting. If it does not exist, add ENABLEINSTRUMENTATION NO to the file, then restart any currently running client processes and services. If the setting does exist, make sure it is set to NO. Also check if INSTRLOGNAME is set; and if it is set, note the specified file name.
* Scan the client machine's file systems for files named "dsminstr.log" and files whose names match whatever is specified by INSTRLOGNAME. Either delete all of these files or delete only those files containing the set password command.
