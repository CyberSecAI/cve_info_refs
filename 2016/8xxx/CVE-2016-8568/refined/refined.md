Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8568:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `git_oid_nfmt` function within the `oid.c` file of the libgit2 library. This occurs during the parsing of a crafted object file using the `cat-file` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `git_oid_nfmt` function attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer when processing a malformed object file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation of the out-of-bounds read leads to a crash of the `cat-file` command due to a heap-buffer-overflow, thus causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

- Crafted Git object file: A specially crafted Git object file is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- cat-file command: The vulnerable `git_oid_nfmt` is triggered by using the `cat-file` command on the crafted object file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted Git object file.
- The attacker needs to use the `cat-file` command on the targeted system.
- No specific privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required because a command needs to be executed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability is related to, and often fixed alongside, CVE-2016-8569, which is a null pointer dereference.
- The vulnerability affects libgit2 versions prior to 0.24.3.
- Several Linux distributions were affected including Fedora, openSUSE, and SUSE products, and have released patches to address the issue.
- The vulnerability was identified through AddressSanitizer reports which detected the out-of-bounds read during the execution of the `cat-file` command with a malicious object file.
