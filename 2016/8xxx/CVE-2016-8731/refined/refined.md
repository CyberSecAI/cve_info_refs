- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hard-coded FTP credentials (username "r", password "r") are present in the Foscam C1 firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded credentials. Specifically, the file `/mtd/app/bin/ftpd/pureftpd.passwd` contains a hash that resolves to `r:r`, allowing anyone to log into the FTP server on the camera.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can gain full read/write access to the mounted Micro-SD card, which contains .avi videos and .jpg snapshots, potentially including audio recordings if the camera has a microphone. This allows the attacker to dump sensitive data remotely.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the Foscam camera's FTP server (port 50021).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs network access to the device with the FTP port 50021 exposed and knowledge of the hard-coded credentials. No authentication or special access is required beyond network access and use of the default username and password.
