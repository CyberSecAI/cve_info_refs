# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0245

## Foscam C1 Webcam FTP Hard Coded Password Vulnerability

##### June 19, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-8731

### Summary

Hard-coded FTP credentials (r:r) are included in the Foscam C1 running firmware 1.9.1.12. Knowledge of these credentials would allow remote access to any cameras found on the internet that do not have port 50021 blocked by an intermediate device.

### Tested Versions

Foscam C1 Firmware Version 1.9.1.12

### Product URLs

[Foscam](http://www.foscam.com/)

### CVSSv3 Score

9.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password

### Details

The file found at ‘/mtd/app/bin/ftpd/pureftpd.passwd’ contains the following hash:
r:$1$whR6Mhk0$FR1VT/mX5D/qwRsgCkHLO.:1001:1001::/mnt/sd/./::::::::::::

This hash resolves to a simple user/pass combo of ‘r:r’. The user/pass of r:r permits anyone to log into a Foscam camera and have full read/write to the mounted Micro-SD card, which contains .avi videos and .jpg snapshots. If the camera has a microphone, the .avi videos will have audio recording as well. An attacker armed with this knowledge can connect remotely to the target camera and dump potentially sensitive data.

### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

### Mitigation

Exploitation relies on the availability of port 50021 (the default FTP port that this camera uses). Preventing access to this port or disabling FTP completely will help mitigate this vulnerability.
