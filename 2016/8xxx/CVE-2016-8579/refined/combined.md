Hi,

In code reviewing, i found an infinite loop vulnerability in retrieving images chain using docker2aci, it occurs during the corresponding json file parsing from user's image archive, fetching the parent image ID until ID is nil. There must be a possibility that the images chain may be a closed cycle, thus , docker2aci will fall into an infinite loop, that's indeed true by some interesting tests.

I think the core cause of this issue is lacking in essential check for duplicated image ID, such as the current image ID could not be equal to its parent image ID, most important, check whether the images chain is a closed cycle.

I processed some interesting test for this issue, building a crafted image whose top layer's parent ID points to itself, then an infinite loop occurred, this flaw caused excessive CPU cycles & resources consume on the host.

expecting subsequent discuss and fix the issue together, and could you request a CVE identifier for that ?
