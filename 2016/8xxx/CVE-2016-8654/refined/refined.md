        "analysis": "This commit fixes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the QMFB code in the JPC codec. The root cause is that a buffer was allocated with a size that was too small in some cases. The vulnerability is located in src/libjasper/jpc/jpc_qmfb.c. The fix involves correcting the calculation of buffer size needed for the split operations in `jpc_qmfb_split_col`, `jpc_qmfb_split_colgrp`, and `jpc_qmfb_split_colres` functions. The original code incorrectly calculated the number of samples needed for the highpass channel, leading to a smaller buffer allocation and a subsequent overflow when copying the saved samples into the highpass channel. The fix also adds a regression test case PoC1.jpc in data/test/bad.",
