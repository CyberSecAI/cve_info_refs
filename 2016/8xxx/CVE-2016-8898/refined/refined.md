Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection (sqli-1):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `product_id` parameter in `/framework/modules/ecommerce/controllers/cartController.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation/sanitization.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `product_id` parameter via a GET request to `/index.php?controller=cart&action=addItem`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or even denial of service.
2.  **SQL Injection (sqli-2):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `version` and `title` parameters in `/framework/modules/help/controllers/helpController.php` are not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation/sanitization.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted `version` and/or `title` parameters via a GET request to `/index.php?controller=help&action=show`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or even denial of service.
3.  **Object Injection (Object Injection -1):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `mod` parameter is used to instantiate a class using user-controlled input via the `$classname` variable and an arbitrary `$item` in the `/framework/modules/core/controllers/expTagController.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Unsafe use of user-provided data to instantiate objects.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request with a malicious `mod` parameter (e.g., `SimpleXMLElement`) and `change_tag[]` parameter containing an XML payload to `/index.php?controller=expTag&action=change_tags`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can exploit this using a gadget class like `SimpleXMLElement` to achieve XXE (XML External Entity) injection, potentially leading to information disclosure by reading local files from the server or DoS.
4. **Object Injection (Object Injection -2):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Similar to object injection -1, the `mod` parameter is used to instantiate a class using user-controlled input in `/framework/modules/core/controllers/expCatController.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Unsafe use of user-provided data to instantiate objects.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request with a malicious `mod` parameter (e.g., `SimpleXMLElement`) and `change_cat[]` parameter containing an XML payload to `/index.php?controller=expCat&action=change_cats`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this using a gadget class like `SimpleXMLElement` to achieve XXE (XML External Entity) injection, potentially leading to information disclosure by reading local files from the server or DoS.

**Summary:**

The provided content details four distinct vulnerabilities in ExponentCMS: two SQL injection flaws and two object injection flaws.  The SQL injection vulnerabilities stem from a lack of input sanitization of parameters used in SQL queries and the object injection vulnerabilities result from the use of user-controlled class names during object instantiation, which can then be exploited to perform XXE attacks. All of these vulnerabilities are exploitable by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the application.

This information aligns with the description for a CVE involving multiple vulnerabilities (SQL injection and object injection) in a content management system.
