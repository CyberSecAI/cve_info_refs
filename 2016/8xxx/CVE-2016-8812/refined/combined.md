# NVIDIA Driver - NvStreamKms 'PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx Local Stack Buffer Overflow Callback / Local Privilege Escalation

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=918

The NvStreamKms.sys driver calls PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx to set up a
process creation notification routine.

In this particular routine,

if ( cur->image_names_count > 0 ) {
  // info_ is the PPS_CREATE_NOTIFY_INFO that is passed to the routine.
  image_filename = info_->ImageFileName;
  buf = image_filename->Buffer;
  if ( buf )
  {
    if ( !v5 )
    {
      i = 0i64;
      num_chars = image_filename->Length / 2;
      // Look for the filename by scanning for backslash.
      if ( num_chars )
      {
        while ( buf[num_chars - (unsigned int)i - 1] != '\\' )
        {
          i = (unsigned int)(i + 1);
          if ( (unsigned int)i >= num_chars )
            goto LABEL_39;
        }
        buf += num_chars - (unsigned __int64)(unsigned int)i;
      }
LABEL_39:
      v26 = (unsigned int)i;
      wcscpy_s((wchar_t *)Dst, i, buf);
      Dst[v26] = 0;
      wcslwr((wchar_t *)Dst);
      v5 = 1;

wcscpy_s is used incorrectly here, as the second argument is not the size of
|Dst|, but rather the calculated size of the filename. |Dst| is a stack buffer
that is at least 255 characters long. The the maximum component paths of most
filesystems on Windows have a limit that is <= 255 though, so this shouldn't be
an issue on normal filesystems.

However, one can pass UNC paths to CreateProcessW containing forward slashes as
the path delimiter, which means that the extracted filename here can be
"a/b/c/...", leading to a buffer overflow. Additionally, this function has no
stack cookie.

e.g.

CreateProcessW(L"\\\\?\\UNC\\127.0.0.1@8000\\DavWWWRoot\\..../..../..../blah.exe", ...

Crashing context with my PoC (Win 10 x64 with 372.54):

NvStreamKms+0x1c6a:
fffff801`5c791c6a c3              ret

kd> dqs rsp
ffffd000`25bc5d18  00410041`00410041

kd> t

...

KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (1e)
...
FAULTING_IP:
NvStreamKms+1c6a
fffff800`5b1d1c6a c3              ret

To reproduce, a WebDAV server is required (can be localhost), and the WebClient
service needs to be started (start can be triggered by user without additional privileges).

Then, run setup to create the long path to the target executable (you'll need to
change the base directories), and then run poc_part1, and then poc_part2 (with
the right UNC path) on the target machine.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
