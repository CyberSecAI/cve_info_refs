Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `NvStreamKms.sys` driver, a component of NVIDIA GeForce Experience, within the process creation notification routine set up by `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx`. Specifically, the issue arises from the incorrect usage of `wcscpy_s`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `wcscpy_s` function copies a calculated filename length to a stack buffer without checking if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the copied data.
- **Missing Stack Cookie:** The vulnerable function lacks a stack cookie, which would normally prevent easy exploitation of stack buffer overflows.
- **Improper Path Handling:** The driver extracts the filename by searching for backslashes. It does not handle forward slashes in a UNC path correctly, leading to an excessively long filename being copied which triggers the overflow.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver fails to validate the length of the extracted filename, using an arbitrary length from user input that is not limited by the size of the destination buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack buffer overflow can crash the system, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The overflow can overwrite data on the stack and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution in kernel mode, ultimately leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **UNC Paths:** The attacker needs to provide a UNC path containing forward slashes to `CreateProcessW`, leading to an excessively long filename and triggering the buffer overflow.
- **WebDAV Server:** A WebDAV server is required to host the file referenced by the UNC path.
- **WebClient Service:** The WebClient service on Windows needs to be running to access the UNC path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the target machine.
- **Ability to Start WebClient Service:** The attacker needs to be able to start the WebClient service (or have it already running).
- **WebDAV Server Setup:** The attacker needs access to or the ability to host a WebDAV server to serve the long-path file.
- **Execution of `CreateProcessW`:** The attacker needs to trigger the execution of `CreateProcessW` with the crafted UNC path.
