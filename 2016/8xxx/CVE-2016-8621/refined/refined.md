  "CVE-2016-8621": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The `curl_getdate` function in curl before version 7.51.0 is vulnerable to an out of bounds read if it receives an input with one digit short.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `curl_getdate` function, when parsing date strings, uses `sscanf` with format specifiers like `%02d:%02d` or `%02d:%02d:%02d`. If the input string is missing the last digit of the second or third integer, `sscanf` advances the read pointer one byte too far, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "Information disclosure or denial of service due to an out-of-bounds read.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Network",
        "Malformed date string"
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can send a specially crafted date string to a vulnerable application that uses libcurl. The vulnerable code is used for parsing HTTP cookies, and date headers.",
      "position": "The attacker can be remote."
