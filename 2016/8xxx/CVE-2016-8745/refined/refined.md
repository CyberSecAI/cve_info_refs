Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2016-8745:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in the error handling of the "send file" code within the NIO HTTP connector of Apache Tomcat.
*   **Weakness:** Incorrect processing of errors led to the same `Processor` object being added multiple times to the `Processor` cache. This resulted in a single `Processor` being used for concurrent requests, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** The sharing of a `Processor` object between requests can lead to information leakage between them. This includes, but is not limited to, session IDs and response bodies.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation occurs through a vulnerability in the NIO HTTP connector, which is part of Tomcat's webserver component.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No specific attacker capabilities or position are described beyond the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected Tomcat instance.

**2. Technical Details (from Bugzilla and Red Hat):**

*   The vulnerability is specifically associated with the NIO HTTP connector in Apache Tomcat.
*   The issue is that when an error occurs during the processing of a send file request, the same Processor object is added to the Processor cache multiple times. This means that a single Processor can be used by different threads handling different requests concurrently.
*   Sharing a Processor object can leak information from one request to another, including session identifiers and response bodies.
*   Patches have been made available to address the issue in various versions of Apache Tomcat: 6.0.50, 7.0.75, 8.0.41, 8.5.9, and 9.0.0.M15.
*   Red Hat also identifies the vulnerability as an "information disclosure due to incorrect Processor sharing".
*   Red Hat's advisory indicates that the vulnerability can lead to HTTP request smuggling, cache poisoning, XSS attacks, or sensitive information theft via manipulating the HTTP response.

**3. Affected Components/Products:**

*   **Apache Tomcat:** Versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13, 8.5.0 to 8.5.8, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.39, 7.0.0 to 7.0.73, and 6.0.16 to 6.0.48 are identified as vulnerable.
*   **NetApp Products:** OnCommand Insight, OnCommand Shift, and Snap Creator Framework.
*   **Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3:** Affected versions are patched in RHSA-2017:0455, RHSA-2017:0456, and RHSA-2017:0457
*  **Red Hat Enterprise Linux:** Affected versions patched in RHSA-2017:0527, RHSA-2017:0935, RHSA-2017:0455, RHSA-2017:0456, and RHSA-2017:0457
*   **Oracle Products:** Several Oracle products including Oracle Fusion Middleware and Oracle E-Business Suite were also affected.
*   **Gentoo:** `www-servers/tomcat` versions less than 8.0.36 are affected, with fixes in 7.0.70 and 8.0.36

**4. Mitigations:**

*   The primary remediation is to upgrade to the fixed versions of Apache Tomcat and related products.
*   Oracle recommends blocking network protocols used by an attack. Removing excessive privileges can reduce the risk of successful attack.
*   Red Hat recommends upgrading to the updated packages as a solution, and restarting the httpd daemon to take effect.

**5. Additional Information:**

*   The bug was discovered in the error handling mechanism when sending a file via the NIO HTTP connector.
*   The vulnerability can result in the `Processor` object being cached multiple times.
*   Concurrent requests might end up using the same `Processor`, leading to information leakage, such as session identifiers and response body data.
*   A Red Hat advisory specifies that the vulnerability is due to an incorrect Processor sharing issue.
*   The Oracle advisory mentions that vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so customers should apply the Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

CVE-2016-8745 is an information disclosure vulnerability in Apache Tomcat's NIO HTTP connector related to improper error handling when sending files. This can lead to the same Processor being shared across concurrent requests, causing session information and response bodies to leak between users. Upgrading to patched versions of affected components and products is the recommended remediation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided data includes information from multiple sources (Red Hat, Oracle, Apache, and NetApp), indicating the broad impact of this vulnerability and its remediation across various vendors.
*   Some of the documents provided are related to security advisories and errata, showing that this CVE has been actively addressed in several ecosystems.
*   The content also includes information on a variety of security updates beyond just CVE-2016-8745, particularly from Oracle's Critical Patch Update Advisory, demonstrating a broader context of software security patches being released.

**Relevant Parts Extracted:**

*  The root cause as incorrect Processor sharing due to a bug in error handling within the NIO HTTP connector for send file code.
*  The vulnerability is an information disclosure, potentially leading to exposure of session IDs and response bodies between concurrent requests.
*  The attack vector is via network requests to a vulnerable Tomcat server.
*   Upgrading to the fixed versions of affected software is the recommended mitigation.
