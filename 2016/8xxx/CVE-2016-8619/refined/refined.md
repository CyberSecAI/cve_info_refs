{
  "CVE-2016-8619": {
    "description": "The function `read_data()` in security.c in curl before version 7.51.0 is vulnerable to memory double free.",
    "root_cause": "The `read_data()` function in `security.c` fails to ensure that the length parameter passed to `realloc()` is not set to 0. This would lead to `realloc()` being called with a zero size, and when doing so, `realloc()` returns `NULL` and frees the memory (unlike normal `realloc()` failures where it only returns `NULL`), causing libcurl to free the memory again in the error path.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double-free vulnerability",
      "Unsafe size_t multiplication"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious or ill-behaving server could trigger a double-free, possibly leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious server can send crafted responses during Kerberos authentication to trigger the double free.",
      "An ill-behaving server can also trigger this vulnerability."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "A malicious or compromised server capable of interacting with a vulnerable curl client. The server needs to be able to send crafted responses during a Kerberos authentication handshake."
