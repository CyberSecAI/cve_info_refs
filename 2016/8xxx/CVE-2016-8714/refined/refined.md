  "cve": "CVE-2016-8714",
  "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the LoadEncoding functionality of the R programming language. A specially crafted R script can cause a buffer overflow resulting in memory corruption. An attacker can send a malicious R script to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the `strcpy` function within the `LoadEncoding` function of the R programming language when loading a user-specified encoding file. The `cname` buffer within the `encnames` array, designed to store encoding names, is of fixed size (40 bytes). When the input from the encoding file exceeds this limit, a buffer overflow occurs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution by corrupting memory.",
     "attack_vectors": "A malicious R script with a specially crafted encoding file triggers the overflow during PDF generation.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted R script to the vulnerable system. User interaction is required for the script to be executed."
