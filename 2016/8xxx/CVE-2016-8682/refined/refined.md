{
  "CVE-2016-8682": {
    "description": "The ReadSCTImage function in coders/sct.c in GraphicsMagick 1.3.25 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted SCT header.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ReadSCTImage function due to insufficient bounds checking when reading the SCT header.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an out-of-bounds read leading to an application crash.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted SCT image file"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted SCT image file.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerable code is located in coders/sct.c, specifically within the ReadSCTImage function. The vulnerability was identified through AddressSanitizer output which indicates a stack-buffer-overflow on a 'buffer' variable."
