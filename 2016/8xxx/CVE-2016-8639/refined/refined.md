  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2016-8639",
    "description": "If an organization or location is created with a name containing HTML, then the administrator-only Settings page will render the HTML as part of a dropdown menu.\n\nThis may permit a stored XSS attack if an organization/location with HTML in the name is created, then an administrator attempts to change the default organization/location settings.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Foreman 1.11.0 to 1.12.4",
      "Red Hat Satellite 6.3"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The application failed to sanitize user-supplied input when rendering dropdown menus in the administrator-only settings page. Specifically, when an organization or location was created with an HTML containing name, that HTML was rendered unescaped as part of a dropdown menu.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "weakness": "Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability",
      "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious code (JavaScript) that would be executed in the browser of an administrator who attempts to change the default organization/location settings. This code could perform various actions, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack requires a user with the ability to create organizations or locations to inject malicious HTML into the name field of these resources. Once created, an administrator visiting the settings page and interacting with the dropdown menu will trigger the XSS payload.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the privilege to create organizations or locations in Foreman or Red Hat Satellite. Additionally, the attacker needs to craft an HTML payload that includes malicious JavaScript that will be executed in the victim's browser.",
        "attacker_positioning": "An attacker needs to be a user of the Foreman or Red Hat Satellite system with the permission to create organizations or locations. They must also have network access to the system to trigger the vulnerability."
    },
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was fixed during a refactoring of the affected code in Foreman 1.13.0. This CVE identifier was assigned retrospectively to describe the vulnerability."
