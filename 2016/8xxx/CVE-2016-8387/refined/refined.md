Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `ipLZWFeedRead` function of Iceni Argus. It occurs during the decoding of LZW-encoded data within a PDF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The LZW decoder lacks proper bounds checking when processing the code dictionary. Specifically, the loop that reads the code dictionary and copies decoded data into a buffer does not verify if it has exceeded the bounds of allocated 0x1000 byte buffer.
*   **Malformed PDF Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed PDF that contains an object with multiple encoding types terminating with an LZW encoded type. This suggests the vulnerability is related to how the software handles unusual data structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow, overwriting memory and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running the vulnerable application (Iceni Argus).
*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious PDF file. The PDF contains a specifically encoded object with multiple encoding types where one of them is LZW encoded type, designed to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must open or process the malicious PDF file using Iceni Argus, which is primarily used by MarkLogic Server to convert PDF files to (X)HTML format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **PDF Crafting:** An attacker needs the ability to create a specifically crafted, malicious PDF file.
*   **Target Interaction:** An attacker must get a user to open or process the crafted PDF with the vulnerable Iceni Argus software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The specific vulnerable version is Iceni Argus Version 6.6.04 (Sep 7 2012) NK.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when an object is decoded using LZW after other encoding methods.
*   The `ipLZWFeedCreate` function initializes the decoder, allocating a buffer of 0x545c bytes with 0x1000 bytes reserved for decoding.
*   The code dictionary is initialized with 0x101 (end-of-data) entries, and the decoding loop should terminate when this value is encountered.
*   The overflow occurs because the decoding loop doesn't terminate properly when end-of-data is not found, leading to writing data outside of allocated 0x1000 buffer.
