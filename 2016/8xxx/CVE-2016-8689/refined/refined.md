Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-8689:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how `libarchive`'s 7zip parser handles multiple `EmptyStream` attributes within a 7zip archive header. Specifically, the `read_Header` function in `archive_read_support_format_7zip.c` doesn't properly manage these attributes, leading to out-of-bounds reads.
- The first `EmptyStream` attribute is used to calculate certain statistics, then subsequent `EmptyStream` attributes overwrite this data, resulting in incompatibility issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** Multiple `EmptyStream` attributes in the header cause calculated values from one attribute to be used to interpret another. This leads to out-of-bounds reads when accessing adjacent heap structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service due to an out-of-bounds read, causing the application using `libarchive` to crash. The SUSE information and the Red Hat bugzilla entry indicate that arbitrary code execution is not possible with this flaw. 
- Some sources rate the availability impact as "partial" while others consider it "complete" or "High".

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted 7zip archive:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening or processing a specially crafted 7zip archive file containing multiple `EmptyStream` attributes in a header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to provide a victim with a specially crafted 7zip archive. There is no mention of a need for authentication or local access.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to convince a user/system to process the malicious archive.

**Additional Details:**
-  The vulnerability exists in libarchive version 3.2.1.
-  The fix involves rejecting headers that have multiple `EmptyStream`, `EmptyFile`, `AntiFile`, `Name` or `Attributes` markers.
- The fix is available in `libarchive` version 3.2.2.
-  The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
-  This vulnerability is related to a series of other issues found around the same time, such as CVE-2016-8687 and CVE-2016-8688.
-  SUSE and Red Hat initially rated this issue differently, with SUSE considering it higher severity than Red Hat.
