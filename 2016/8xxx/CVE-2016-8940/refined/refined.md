- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient authority checking on SQL queries. The software does not restrict which database tables are accessible by administrators.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper access control for SQL queries, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive database tables.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of user credentials and product-sensitive information, including passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is done via SQL queries submitted by any administrator of the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be an administrator of the vulnerable Tivoli Storage Manager (IBM Spectrum Protect) instance.
