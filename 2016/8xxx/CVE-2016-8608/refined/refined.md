```
Root cause of vulnerability: Incomplete fix for CVE-2016-5398, leading to insufficient sanitization of scripts stored in business processes.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Impact of exploitation: Remote, authenticated attackers with privileges to create business processes can inject malicious scripts that are not sanitized, leading to the execution of these scripts in the browsers of other users, including administrators, when they view the processes.
Attack vectors: By creating or modifying a business process, an attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have the privileges to create or modify business processes in JBoss BRMS 6 or BPM Suite 6.
