Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `unserialize()` function in the `htsrv/call_plugin.php` file of the b2evolution software. Specifically, the `params` parameter, which is passed to the script, is directly unserialized without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is object injection. By providing a specially crafted serialized string as the `params` value, an attacker can instantiate arbitrary PHP objects, leading to various malicious consequences.
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization before deserializing the `params` parameter using `unserialize()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful object injection can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected system.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could also manipulate data or application state by controlling the properties of the instantiated objects.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability may also result in a denial of service by exhausting server resources or causing application crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker can inject malicious serialized objects by manipulating the `params` parameter in an HTTP request.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without any authentication, making it highly critical.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the affected b2evolution instance.
*   **Knowledge of PHP:** The attacker should be familiar with PHP object serialization and the concept of object injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious serialized payload.

**Additional Details:**

* The initial fix introduced in commit `25c21cf9cc4261324001f9039509710b37ee2c4d` attempted to restrict unserialization to only arrays by checking for the "a:" prefix in the serialized data. However, this was insufficient.
* A subsequent fix, addressed in commit `999b5ad1d59760d7e450ceb541f55432fc74cd27`, added a regex check to ensure the serialized data did not contain object definitions (`O:`), providing better protection against object injection.
* The `openwall.com` content confirms the object injection vulnerability was reported and fixed by b2evolution team, and requested a CVE for the issue.
