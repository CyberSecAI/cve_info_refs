Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8703:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `bm_readbody_bmp` function within the `bitmap_io.c` file of potrace. This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when processing a crafted BMP image.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when handling the bitmap data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by overwriting heap metadata or adjacent allocated chunks.
- Denial of service: The overflow leads to a crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By processing a crafted BMP image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted BMP image file to the vulnerable `potrace` application.
- User interaction: Typically the user would need to execute `potrace` using the malicious image as an input.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzz testing using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- Several other heap-based buffer overflows were found in the same function, each triggered by different crafted images. These have been assigned separate CVEs (CVE-2016-8698, CVE-2016-8699, CVE-2016-8700, CVE-2016-8701, and CVE-2016-8702).
- The specific crash location for CVE-2016-8703 is at `bitmap_io.c:601:2`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in potrace version 1.13.
