Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-8707:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how ImageMagick handles Adobe Deflate compressed TIFF images.
*   The software calculates the buffer size needed for the decompressed data but the calculated size is insufficient. This results in a buffer overflow during decompression.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write when decompressing a specially crafted TIFF image. The `inflate` function in `libz` attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Insufficient buffer size:** The buffer allocated to hold the decompressed TIFF data is smaller than what is actually required.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While the vulnerability leads to an out-of-bounds write, the report suggests that under the right circumstances, this can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF file:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious TIFF image using Adobe Deflate compression that, when processed by ImageMagick's `convert` utility, will trigger the overflow.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered by user-controlled TIFF files being processed by ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malformed TIFF:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TIFF file to a system using the vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This could occur via a web application or any system processing user provided images.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs specific knowledge of the vulnerability and the required malformed data to trigger the out-of-bounds write.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `ZIPDecode` function of the `libtiff` library when used by ImageMagick.
*   The Talos report provides a crash log showing the program crashing in the `inflate` function within `libz`. This confirms the out-of-bounds write.
*   The Debian security advisory mentions that this vulnerability is one of several memory handling issues and missing input sanitization problems in ImageMagick, but it does not give specific details about this CVE.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `convert` utility of ImageMagick, which is commonly used by web applications for image manipulation.
