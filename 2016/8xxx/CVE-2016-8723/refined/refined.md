- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A null pointer dereference occurs in the web application functionality of Moxa AWK-3131A due to a missing leading '/' in an HTTP GET request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The web server lacks proper input validation for HTTP GET requests, leading to a null pointer dereference when a request without a leading '/' is received.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault in the web server, effectively leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The web application cannot be restarted without rebooting the device.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request without a leading '/' to the web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web server. No authentication is required.
