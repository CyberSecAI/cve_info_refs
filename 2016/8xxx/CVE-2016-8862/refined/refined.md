Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8862:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted image that leads to a memory allocation failure in ImageMagick's `AcquireMagickMemory` function. This occurs during the processing of Run-Length Encoded (RLE) images, specifically within the `ReadRLEImage` function when allocating memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Memory exhaustion:** A crafted RLE image can cause an excessive memory allocation request, leading to a denial-of-service due to the program being unable to allocate the required memory.
-   **Improper Input Handling:** The code does not properly validate the size parameters within the image file, allowing a malicious user to specify an extremely large value resulting in a huge memory allocation attempt.
-   **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** The program attempts to allocate a large chunk of memory based on data derived from the image file itself, without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service by crashing the ImageMagick process due to memory allocation failure.
-   **Resource exhaustion:** Attackers can consume excessive system resources, making the system unusable or slow.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Malicious Image File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted RLE image file as input to ImageMagick.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs the ability to provide an image file to the ImageMagick program, either by directly providing the file path or indirectly through an application that uses ImageMagick for image processing.
-   No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**
-   The vulnerability is present in the `coders/rle.c` file.
-   The fix involves adding a check to prevent excessively large memory allocations.
-   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing by Agostino Sarubbo.
-   The vulnerability was initially reported as a memory allocation failure but was later recognized as a security issue due to its DoS implications.
-   The issue is reproducible in ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.3.3.
-   The fix for this issue is in commit `aea6c6507f55632829e6432f8177a084a57c9fcc`.
-   The vulnerability is related to issue #271 on the ImageMagick Github repository, where the issue was originally reported as a memory allocation failure.

The `map_length` variable read from the RLE file, is shifted to calculate allocation size using `map_length=one << map_length`. An unvalidated `map_length` can lead to very large values which leads to memory exhaustion. The fix adds a check to ensure the map_length is less than 32 to prevent this.
