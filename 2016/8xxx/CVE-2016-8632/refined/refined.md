Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-8632:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `tipc_msg_build()` function within the TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) networking subsystem of the Linux kernel.
*   The `tipc_msg_build()` function does not properly validate the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) value passed to it. Specifically, it doesn't check if the provided `pktmax` (MTU) is large enough to accommodate the message header (`INT_H_SIZE + mhsz`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The lack of proper MTU validation in `tipc_msg_build()` is the primary weakness. The function proceeds with memory operations even if the supplied MTU is insufficient to hold the required headers and potentially the message data.
*   **Heap Overflow:** If the provided `pktmax` value is smaller than `INT_H_SIZE + mhsz`, the function writes data beyond the allocated buffer (`skb->data`), leading to a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The heap overflow can overwrite adjacent memory regions, leading to data corruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By strategically crafting the overflow, an attacker could potentially overwrite kernel structures, potentially leading to privilege escalation, allowing them to gain elevated access to the system.
    
**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** An attacker would need the ability to influence MTU values on networking devices configured as bearers for the TIPC protocol.  
*   **Local Access (CAP_NET_ADMIN):** The attacker must have the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability, allowing them to manipulate network settings, including MTU and to use TIPC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CAP_NET_ADMIN Capability:** The attacker needs the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability to manipulate the network interface settings.
*   **Control Over MTU:** The attacker needs to be able to set or influence a low MTU value, particularly on network interfaces used by TIPC.  The attacker needs to be able to make the MTU value lower than INT_H_SIZE + mhsz so that the memory corruption happens.
*   **Knowledge of TIPC:** The attacker needs an understanding of how to interact with the TIPC subsystem, specifically the ability to send messages.
*  **System with Low MTU:** The target system needs to be configured with an unusually low MTU (e.g. 60).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a system is configured with an unusually low MTU (e.g. 60) on networking devices configured as bearers for the TIPC protocol.
*  The affected code is not enabled in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.
* The vulnerability was reported by Qian Zhang from Qihoo 360 Marvel Team.
* A patch was created to address the vulnerability, which includes a check to ensure that `INT_H_SIZE + mhsz` does not exceed `pktmax`.
