| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1390832#c0)  Wade Mealing    2016-11-02 03:52:10 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the TIPC networking subsystem which could allow for memory corruption and possible priveledge escalation.  The flaw involves a system with an unusually low MTU (60) on networking devices configured as bearers for the TIPC protocol.  Not all devices support or allow MTU's below 68 octets.  An attacker can create a packet which will overwrite memory outside of allocated space and this can allow for priveledge escalation.  The affected code is not enabled on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.  The affected code was not included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Initial patch:  [https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg133205.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev%40vger.kernel.org/msg133205.html)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1390832#c1)  Wade Mealing    2016-11-02 03:55:43 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Qian Zhang from Qihoo 360 Marvel Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1390832#c2)  Wade Mealing    2016-11-02 05:56:37 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue is rated as important.

# [[PATCH net] tipc: Guard against tiny MTU in tipc\_msg\_build()](/search?l=netdev@vger.kernel.org&q=subject:%22%5C%5BPATCH+net%5C%5D+tipc%5C%3A+Guard+against+tiny+MTU+in+tipc_msg_build%5C%28%5C%29%22&o=newest)

[Ben Hutchings](/search?l=netdev@vger.kernel.org&q=from:%22Ben+Hutchings%22)
[Tue, 18 Oct 2016 19:17:33 -0700](/search?l=netdev@vger.kernel.org&q=date:20161018)

```
Qian Zhang (张谦) reported a potential socket buffer overflow in
tipc_msg_build().  The minimum fragment length needs to be checked
against the maximum packet size, which is based on the link MTU.
```
```

Reported-by: Qian Zhang (张谦) <zhangqia...@360.cn>
Signed-off-by: Ben Hutchings <b...@decadent.org.uk>

This is untested, but I think it fixes the issue reported.  Ideally
tipc_l2_device_event() would also disable use of TIPC on devices with
too small an MTU, like several other protocols do.

Ben.

Subject: CVE-2016-8632 -- Linux kernel: tipc_msg_build() doesn't validate MTU that can trigger heap overflow

Hi all,

Recently I found a flaw in the TIPC networking subsystem which could allow for memory corruption and possible privilege escalation (CVE-2016-8632).
I made this post to oss-sec for outlining the flaw and letting people know the CVE.

First upstream patch(it hasn't been pushed upstream yet):
[https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg133205.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev%40vger.kernel.org/msg133205.html)

VULNERABILITY
-----------------------
Recently i took a glance for function tipc_msg_build() at net/tipc/msg.c:244 on linux kernel 4.8.1.
It seems like tipc_msg_build() doesn't validate the parameter pktmax(MTU) passed from tipc_sendmcast(), and if I could change this value lower than (INT_H_SIZE + mhsz), It maybe can trigger heap overflow in skb->data.

static int tipc_sendmcast(struct  socket *sock, struct tipc_name_seq *seq,
                  struct msghdr *msg, size_t dsz, long timeo)
{
         . . .

new_mtu:
         mtu = tipc_bcast_get_mtu(net);
         rc = tipc_msg_build(mhdr, msg, 0, dsz, mtu, &pktchain);

         . . .
}

int tipc_msg_build(struct tipc_msg *mhdr, struct msghdr *m,
                      int offset, int dsz, int pktmax, struct sk_buff_head *list)
{
         int mhsz = msg_hdr_sz(mhdr);
         int msz = mhsz + dsz;
         int pktno = 1;
         int pktsz;
         int pktrem = pktmax;
         int drem = dsz;
         struct tipc_msg pkthdr;
         struct sk_buff *skb;
         char *pktpos;
         int rc;

         msg_set_size(mhdr, msz);

         . . .

         /* Prepare first fragment */
         skb = tipc_buf_acquire(pktmax);
         if (!skb)
                   return -ENOMEM;
         skb_orphan(skb);
         __skb_queue_tail(list, skb);
         pktpos = skb->data;
         skb_copy_to_linear_data(skb, &pkthdr, INT_H_SIZE);
         pktpos += INT_H_SIZE;
         pktrem -= INT_H_SIZE;
         skb_copy_to_linear_data_offset(skb, INT_H_SIZE, mhdr, mhsz);
         pktpos += mhsz;
         pktrem -= mhsz;

         . . .
}

The MTU value can obtained from tipc_bcast_get_mtu(), and this value can be settled by tipc_link_set_mtu(), I search around withing the source code of 4.8.1, founded that only tipc_bcbase_select_primary() invokes tipc_link_set_mtu().

static void tipc_bcbase_select_primary(struct net *net)
{
         . . .

         for (i = 0; i < MAX_BEARERS; i++) {
                   if (!bb->dests[i])
                            continue;

                   mtu = tipc_bearer_mtu(net, i);
                   if (mtu < tipc_link_mtu(bb->link))
                            tipc_link_set_mtu(bb->link, mtu);

                   . . .
         }
}

int tipc_bearer_mtu(struct net *net, u32 bearer_id)
{
         int mtu = 0;
         struct tipc_bearer *b;

         rcu_read_lock();
         b = rcu_dereference_rtnl(tipc_net(net)->bearer_list[bearer_id]);
         if (b)
                   mtu = b->mtu;
         rcu_read_unlock();
         return mtu;
}

Obviously tipc_bearer_mtu() return MTU value by object tipc_bearer which directly inherited from net device MTU.(eth0 MTU on my situation)

INFO
-------
Red Hat Product Security has assigned CVE-2016-8632 to this vulnerability.
This issue may cause memory corruption and even escalate privilege if we layout the appropriate heap space by any user with CAP_NET_ADMIN.

AFFECTED VERSION
-----------------------
I use kernel 4.6.2 x86_64 to reproduce the issue, but it also seems like vulnerable in the latest kernel version(4.9-rc4).

SOLUTION
---------------
First upstream patch:
[https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg133205.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev%40vger.kernel.org/msg133205.html)

CREDITS
------------
This vulnerability was found by Qian Zhang from MarvelTeam Qihoo 360.
