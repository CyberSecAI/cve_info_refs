Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Moodle question engine did not properly restrict access to embedded files within questions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** Users could potentially access files they were not intended to view by guessing the URL of the file embedded in a question.
- The system relies on a user's inability to guess the URL rather than proper access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: Users could download files they should not have access to.
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive information embedded within the questions could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- URL Guessing: An attacker would need to guess the file's URL by knowing the identifier of the question it was embedded within.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with access to at least one question containing embedded files.
- The attacker must be able to guess the file's URL.
