- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in Honeywell Experion PKS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly validate input, allowing an attacker to send a specially crafted packet that terminates the process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation prevents the Experion PKS client tools from uploading firmware to Series-C devices, causing a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted network packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with medium skill is required. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
