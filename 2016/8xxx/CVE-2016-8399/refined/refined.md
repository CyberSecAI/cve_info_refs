{
  "CVE-2016-8399": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its destination via sendto(). This is due to a lack of size checking on ICMP header length.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory access",
       "Lack of input validation"
     ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities can cause an out-of-bounds memory access. The out-of-bounds read on the stack may also lead to an information leak if the data can be validated and included in the outgoing packet data.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker creates a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sends it to its destination using `sendto()`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities. A user with CAP_NET_RAW can also trigger a similar issue on IPv6 related code."
