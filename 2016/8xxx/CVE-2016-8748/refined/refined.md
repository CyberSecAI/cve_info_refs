Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied text in the "Connection Details" dialog within the Apache NiFi UI. Specifically, text was not being properly sanitized or escaped before being added to the Document Object Model (DOM), which is used to render web page content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability.  The lack of proper sanitization of user input allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  If successfully exploited, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute within the browser session of an authenticated user. This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the application.
    - **Malicious Actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the user within the NiFi application.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
- **Compromise of Integrity:** The integrity of the application and user data could be compromised.
- **Reputational Damage:**  Exploitation of the vulnerability could damage the reputation of the application and the affected organization.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** An attacker would inject the XSS payload into a field or parameter that's then displayed in the "Connection Details" dialog.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker would need to entice a legitimate, authorized user to access the manipulated part of the NiFi application where their malicious code is reflected. This can be through social engineering or by modifying data displayed.
- **Reflected XSS:** The attack is a reflected XSS vulnerability, which means the malicious script is not persistently stored on the server. It is injected within a request and reflected back to the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authorized User:** The attacker must be an authorized user of the NiFi application.
- **Knowledge of NiFi:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the NiFi application to know where they can inject malicious text that will be reflected in the "Connection Details" dialog.
- **Social engineering skills (potentially):** To trick the user into opening the malicious page, an attacker might require some social engineering skill to be effective.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Apache NiFi versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in versions 1.0.1 and 1.1.1.
*   The fix was introduced after code review of the pull request (PR) which is mentioned in both the Jira ticket and on the GitHub commit.
*  The issue specifically involved text within the "Connection Details" and "Connection Configuration" dialogs, and the fix involved adding an ellipsis class to long text values to prevent overflow. This fix also resolved the XSS issue by correctly sanitizing and escaping the input to prevent script execution, which was a side-effect of the original text overflow problem.
