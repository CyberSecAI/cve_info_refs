- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted PDF file can cause the Nitro Pro 10 software to access a malformed or uninitialized memory region when parsing the PDF file due to an issue in the `npdf.dll` library, specifically within the `CxImagePNG::user_write_data` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of memory during PDF parsing. The code attempts to read a pointer from a memory location that may contain uninitialized or malformed data. This leads to an attempt to dereference an invalid pointer, causing a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can create a malicious PDF file that, when opened by a victim using Nitro Pro 10, can execute arbitrary code, potentially giving the attacker control over the victim's system.
- **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF file sent to the victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious PDF file and deliver it to a victim using Nitro Pro 10. No special network position is needed. The attack is dependent on the user opening the crafted PDF file.
