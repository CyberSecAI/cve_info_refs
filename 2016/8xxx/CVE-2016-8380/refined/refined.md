Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-8380:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content from ics-cert.us-cert.gov explicitly mentions CVE-2016-8380 and describes a vulnerability related to accessing PLC variables without authentication.
   - The exploit-db.com content also references CVE-2016-8380 and provides a script to exploit the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is that the web server on Phoenix Contact ILC PLCs allows unauthorized access to read and write PLC variables.
   - This is due to the lack of proper authentication mechanisms for accessing critical PLC variables via the web server.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **CWE-767: Access to Critical Private Variable via Public Method:** This vulnerability allows access to PLC variables through the webserver without proper authentication or authorization.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An unauthenticated attacker can read and modify PLC variables.
   - This can lead to unauthorized control over the PLC, potentially disrupting the industrial process it controls.
   - The attacker can manipulate the behavior of the system, causing damage, downtime, or safety incidents.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is remote, exploiting the web server interface of the PLC via HTTP requests.
   - The attacker sends crafted requests to the PLC's web server to read/write variable values.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs network access to the PLC, meaning they have to be on the same network or have the ability to route to the PLC's network.
   - The attacker does not need prior authentication. A low-skilled attacker can exploit this vulnerability according to the ICS-CERT advisory.
   - The attacker needs knowledge of the PLC's project name, which can be obtained by simply browsing to the root directory of the device on port 80.
   - The attacker needs knowledge of the tag names, which can be obtained by requesting the TCR file for the project.

**Additional details from Exploit-DB Content:**

- The exploit-db entry provides a Python script (CVE-2016-8380-SetPLCValues.py) that automates the process of exploiting this vulnerability.
- The script first retrieves the project name by querying the root URL of the PLC.
- Then, it retrieves the tag list by querying the project's TCR file.
- Subsequently it queries the PLC for all of the tag values.
- It allows the user to select a specific tag and modifies the tag with a new value via a writeVal.exe request
- The provided script uses HTTP GET and POST requests to the PLC's web server, showing the ease of exploitation.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-8380 describes a critical vulnerability in Phoenix Contact ILC PLCs that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read and write PLC variables. This vulnerability is a result of improperly secured web server access to critical PLC variables, and is easily exploited.
