    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read sensitive data, modify database content, and potentially gain full control over the database, leading to significant data loss, integrity issues, or unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending crafted CQL queries through the pycsw interface, attackers can manipulate the generated SQL queries.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the pycsw instance. No authentication is mentioned as required for exploitation.",
    "patch": "The vulnerability was patched in pycsw versions 2.0.2, 1.10.5 and 1.8.6. The patch is in the commit https://github.com/geopython/pycsw/pull/474/files"
