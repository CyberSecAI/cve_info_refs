CVE-2016-8606 guile: REPL server vulnerable to HTTP inter-protocol attacks
...
| Fixed In Version: | guile 2.0.13 |
...
| Doc Text: | A vulnerability was found in guile's REPL server (--listen), making it vulnerable to HTTP inter-protocol attacks. A crafted website, when visited by a developer with an instance of the REPL server, could cause arbitrary code execution within the guile scheme interpreter. |

GNU Guile, an implementation of the Scheme language, provides a "REPL server" which is a command prompt that developers can connect to for live coding and debugging purposes. The REPL server is started by the '--listen' command-line option or equivalent API.
It was  reported that the REPL server is vulnerable to the HTTP inter-protocol attack
This constitutes a remote code execution vulnerability for developers running a REPL server that listens on a loopback device or private network. Applications that do not run a REPL server, as is usually the case, are unaffected.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1383972>
```
Based on the provided documents, here's a summary of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GNU Guile REPL server, when started with the `--listen` command-line option, is vulnerable to HTTP inter-protocol attacks, specifically HTML form protocol attacks. This is because the server does not properly validate the incoming data stream and might process HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The REPL server lacks input sanitization and validation, making it susceptible to processing HTTP requests sent to it.
- The server does not distinguish between valid REPL commands and HTTP requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the Guile Scheme interpreter. This means an attacker can execute commands on the system hosting the REPL server with the privileges of the user running the Guile process.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request to the REPL server. This can be done by an attacker controlling a webpage that the victim (a developer running the REPL server) visits.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the host running the vulnerable Guile REPL server.
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a developer using the vulnerable REPL to connect to the attacker's malicious site or send a crafted HTTP request. This can be accomplished by convincing a developer to visit a malicious website or through other methods of network request injection (ex: DNS poisoning).
- The vulnerable Guile REPL server must be listening on a network interface accessible to the attacker (ex: loopback or private network).

The vulnerability is present in GNU Guile versions <= 2.0.12. It is fixed in version 2.0.13 by adding a check for a possible HTTP request line in the first line of input and closing the socket if a request is detected.
