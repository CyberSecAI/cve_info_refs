Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-8826:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys for Windows or nvidia.ko for Linux), where a user can trigger a GPU interrupt storm.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The driver does not properly handle user-generated actions that lead to excessive GPU interrupts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The excessive interrupts can make the system unstable or unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is local, requiring a user to interact with the driver in a specific way to trigger the interrupt storm.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to interact with the NVIDIA GPU driver. User privileges are sufficient for this attack.
