### Vulnerability Details

#### CVE-2016-8821

NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape where improper access controls may allow a user to access arbitrary physical memory, leading to an escalation of privileges.

CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: 7.7
CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C)

#### CVE-2016-8822

NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape ID 0x600000E, 0x600000F, and 0x6000010 where a value passed from a user to the driver is used without validation as the index to an internal array, leading to denial of service or potential escalation of privileges.

CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: 7.9
CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)

#### CVE-2016-8823

NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape where the size of an input buffer is not validated leading to a denial of service or possible escalation of privileges.

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)

#### CVE-2016-8824

NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape where improper access controls allow a regular user to write a part of the registry intended for privileged users only, leading to escalation of privileges.

CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: 7.9
CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)

#### CVE-2016-8825

NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape where the size of an input buffer is not validated, leading to denial of service or potential escalation of privileges.

CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: 7.9
CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)

#### CVE-2016-8826

NVIDIA GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys for Windows or nvidia.ko for Linux) where a user can cause a GPU interrupt storm, leading to a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: 5.9
CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)
