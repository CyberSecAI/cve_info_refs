  "CVE-2016-5705": {
    "Description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7 and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving (1) server-privileges certificate data fields on the user privileges page, (2) an \"invalid JSON\" error message in the error console, (3) a database name in the central columns implementation, (4) a group name, or (5) a search name in the bookmarks implementation.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the web interface. This lack of output sanitization allows for the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the web page, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious inputs in various fields of phpMyAdmin:",
      "1. Server privileges certificate data fields on the user privileges page",
      "2. Error message in error console",
      "3. Database name in the central columns feature",
      "4. User group names",
      "5. Saved search names in bookmarks"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject crafted input into the vulnerable fields of the application via the web interface. This may or may not require prior authentication depending on the specific vector."
  },
    "CVE-2016-5706": {
    "Description": "js/get_scripts.js.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a large array in the scripts parameter.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly handle a large array passed in the 'scripts' parameter. This leads to excessive resource consumption, ultimately resulting in a denial of service.",
     "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
       "Denial of Service (DoS)"
     ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could render the phpMyAdmin service unavailable due to resource exhaustion.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can send an HTTP request to js/get_scripts.js.php with an excessively large array in the 'scripts' parameter."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target system."
  },
   "CVE-2016-5701": {
    "Description": "setup/frames/index.inc.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0.10.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.15.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 allows remote attackers to conduct BBCode injection attacks against HTTP sessions via a crafted URI.",
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input within URIs, leading to BBCode injection, which can then be reflected in HTTP sessions, resulting in further malicious behavior. This occurs because the code is directly using the crafted URI without sanitizing the data properly.",
     "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
       "BBCode Injection"
     ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could result in malicious content being injected into HTTP sessions, potentially leading to information disclosure or other session-related attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can craft a malicious URI containing BBCode that is not properly sanitized by the application."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted URI to the application."

    "CVE-2016-5703": {
    "Description": "SQL injection vulnerability in libraries/central_columns.lib.php in phpMyAdmin 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7 and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a crafted database name that is mishandled in a central column query.",
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize the database name properly before using it in an SQL query related to central column data. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands via a specially crafted database name.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
       "SQL Injection"
     ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a malicious database name."

     "Description": "phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via vectors involving (1) an array value to FormDisplay.php, (2) incorrect data to validate.php, (3) unexpected data to Validator.php, (4) a missing config directory during setup, or (5) an incorrect OpenID identifier data type, which reveals the full path in an error message.",
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's error handling reveals the full path on the system when specific invalid input is provided. This happens due to the lack of sanitization of input within certain files leading to full path disclosure in error messages.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Path Disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could provide an attacker with sensitive system information such as the full path to the installation, which can assist in further attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Multiple vectors can be used, such as providing an array value to FormDisplay.php, incorrect data to validate.php, unexpected data to Validator.php, or by having a missing config directory during setup. An incorrect OpenID identifier data type can also trigger the path disclosure in an error message."
