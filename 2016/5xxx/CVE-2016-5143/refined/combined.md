I see the problem. The two locations serve different purposes though: devtools_ui constructs it, and devtools.js validates it for security reasons. I think it's actually possible to do the validation in devtools_ui, and just prevent navigation or not create DevToolsUIBindings when the url is suspicious. It would be a bit harder to implement, but we can go for it. Are you interested to contribute? ```     | **Rafał Chłodnicki** | | On 2016/06/30 16:25:53, dgozman wrote: > On 2016/06/30 14:36:39, Rafał Chłodnicki wrote: > > I ... | | --- | | 4 years, 5 months ago (2016-07-01 10:02:42 UTC) [#12](#msg12) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Message was sent while issue was closed. ``` On 2016/06/30 16:25:53, dgozman wrote: > On 2016/06/30 14:36:39, Rafał Chłodnicki wrote: > > I wish that the URL would be constructed from constants defined in > > chrome/browser/ui/webui/devtools_ui.cc and exposed to JS instead of hardcoding > > them in two separate places. > >  > > We in Opera have to apply more patches if things are hardcoded like that. > > If Google is potentially interested then I could improve that (although I'm > not > > very familiar with this code). >  > I see the problem.

Are you interested > to contribute?  I wouldn't mind but I'm a bit overloaded right now. My managers have other assignments for me. And also you seem to have much better idea of how to fix that. :) And I don't have access to related security bugs (although our security group does and explained to me what are those about) so it's hard for me to communicate about this issue.   (Also I can't CC myself on this review as it's closed so I'm not getting notifications.) ```     | **dgozman** | | dgozman@chromium.org changed reviewers: + lushnikov@chromium.org | | --- | | 4 years, 5 months ago (2016-07-06 17:08:00 UTC) [#13](#msg13) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Message was sent while issue was closed. ``` dgozman@chromium.org changed reviewers: + lushnikov@chromium.org ```     | **dgozman** | | +lushnikov, who was interested in this area. | | --- | | 4 years, 5 months ago (2016-07-06 17:08:01 UTC) [#14](#msg14) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Message was sent while issue was closed. ``` +lushnikov, who was interested in this area. ```     Expand Messages | Collapse Messages | Show Generated Messages | Hide Generated Messages |

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/08/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, August 3, 2016

The stable channel has been updated to 52.0.2743.116 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [10 security fixes](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-1-M52). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$1000][[618333](https://crbug.com/618333)] Medium CVE-2016-5144 Parameter sanitization failure in DevTools. Credit to Gregory Panakkal

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[633486](https://crbug.com/633486)] CVE-2016-5146: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/52.0.2743.82..52.0.2743.116?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Interested in [switching](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) release channels? Find out [how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
