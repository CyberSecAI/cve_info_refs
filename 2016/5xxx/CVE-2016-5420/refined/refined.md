Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `libcurl` library's handling of TLS connection reuse when client certificates are involved. Specifically, `libcurl` did not check the client certificate when choosing a TLS connection to reuse from its connection pool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Client Certificate Validation:** When reusing an existing TLS connection from a pool, `libcurl` failed to verify if the client certificate associated with the original connection matched the client certificate requested for the new request, or even if a client certificate was required at all. This allowed connections intended for different clients, or for no client at all, to be incorrectly reused.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially hijack the authentication of a connection by leveraging a previously created connection with a different client certificate.
*   **Sending requests to the wrong realm:** Applications using libcurl may send requests to the wrong server realms with unintended authentication credentials
*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** The exploitation could lead to unauthorized access of data (loss of confidentiality) and sending manipulated information (loss of integrity), depending on server configuration and access control policies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker would not directly leverage the vulnerability during the MITM attack but rather exploit the connection pool mis-reuse vulnerability in libcurl.
*   **Connection Pool Exploitation:** The attacker could control what connection is used, by controlling what client certificate the libcurl client is asked to use, and subsequently making a request where that same connection can be re-used with no or another certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control the creation of the first TLS connection to the server in order for it to be added to the connection pool.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to control or influence a client using libcurl to re-use an existing connection.
*   The attacker needs to cause a legitimate connection to be placed in the connection pool.
*   The attacker does not need to be present in the middle of the traffic, but instead relies on the reuse of existing connections.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability impacts both the `curl` command-line tool and the `libcurl` library.
*   The fix was implemented in `libcurl` version 7.50.1.
*   The issue was present in libcurl versions 7.32.0 up to 7.50.0 (inclusive).
*   The vulnerability is described as being of moderate severity by several sources, although some list it as important.
* Several vendors, including Debian, Red Hat, Suse, and Slackware, released security updates to address this issue.
* Red Hat stated that versions of `curl` shipped with RHEL 5, 6 and 7 were not affected since they did not contain the vulnerable code.
