Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-5401

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The JBoss BPMS (Business Process Management System) business-central application lacks implementation of CSRF protection tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Absence of CSRF tokens: The application does not use tokens to verify that requests originate from the application itself and not an external malicious site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Unwanted modification of the target's instance: An attacker can trick a logged-in user into unknowingly performing actions they didn't intend.
*   CSRF attacks can cause changes to the state of the target application

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Specially crafted web page: An attacker creates a malicious web page that contains crafted requests targeted at the vulnerable JBoss BPMS application.
*   Social Engineering: The attacker leads a logged-in, trusted user to visit the malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Ability to create and host a malicious web page.
*   Ability to trick a logged-in user of the JBoss BPMS application to visit the crafted web page.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of CSRF protection in the JBoss BPMS business-central application. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can trick a logged-in user into unintentionally executing actions within the application by visiting a specially crafted web page.
