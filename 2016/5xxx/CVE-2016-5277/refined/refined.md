  "CVE-2016-5277": {
    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability with web animations when destroying a timeline.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the failure to unregister a DocumentTimeline from a refresh driver when the timeline is destroyed through document.write. When an animation attempts to update on this destroyed timeline, it leads to a use-after-free.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially cause a crash or execute arbitrary code due to a use-after-free vulnerability",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Trigger the vulnerability by using specific Javascript calls (document.write, requestAnimationFrame, animation, etc) to cause the timeline to be destroyed without unregistering the refresh driver."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page that triggers the described sequence of Javascript actions to reach the vulnerable code."
  }
