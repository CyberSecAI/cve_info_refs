| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

It looks like we're destroying the timeline without unregistering from the refresh driver. Presumably this happens because we release the document created with Document.write (and we don't go through the usual presshell/refreshdriver destruction that we would for regular documents).

It's going to take a few days to triage and assign this properly (it always takes me a while to get an ASAN build going, especially with the fuzzing extension, but this time it appears I have to rebuild clang too). Anyway, it's at the top of my list.Flags: needinfo?(bbirtles)

Actually this works correctly, but after it,
o856.currentTime = 183;
here, we re-observed the same refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::NotifyAnimationUpdated.
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/0ba72e8027cf/dom/animation/DocumentTimeline.cpp#l130>
Should we nullify all animations' mTimeline when nsDocument::Reset?

Oh, so the reset happens in f1 when we call document.write()? That makes sense.
> Should we nullify all animations' mTimeline when nsDocument::Reset?
I haven't looked into this properly, but I'm not sure if that works. I think we only store a reference to animations that are currently active (e.g. when NeedsTicks() returns true or some other changes has happened causing them to request a tick) so we couldn't get to them all by iterating over AnimationTimeline::mAnimations. If an animation was paused it might not be in the timeline's list of animations but if it was resumed it would end up calling NotifyAnimationUpdated(). Unless you mean to traverse the document and get all the animations that way?
I wonder if instead, after we get a call to NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying we could set a flag on the timeline. Then in NotifyAnimationUpdated() we could just skip re-adding to the refresh driver in that case. I'm not sure if we should clear that flag on a subsequent call to NotifyRefreshDriverCreated, but I suppose we should.
Would that work?

I meant to traverse all the animations. I did't think it's a good idea though.

Yes, this should work. A remaining concern is that when we can change the old timeline to a new one. Is it unnecessary? I don't remember we set timeline when the animation is associated with a document.

So there appear to be a few problems here:
a. We can have a situation where we have a cycle between a DocumentTimeline and
an Animation (i.e. where they are the only things keeping each other alive).
When we break that cycle, there is nothing that causes the DocumentTimeline
to be removed from its refresh driver. (The assertion in ~DocumentTimeline
that checks mIsObservingRefreshDriver is false should fail in this case but
this is an opt build so it doesn't show up above.)
b. Even after calling NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying() we can still end up
calling GetRefreshDriver() from DocumentTimeline::NotifyAnimationUpdated and
re-registering with the (supposedly) destroyed refresh driver.
This is surprising, I would have thought that the pres context would not
return a valid refresh driver after we call NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying()
but I \*think\* what happens is that we don't actually destroy the refresh
driver in nsDocument::Reset but we simply call that method as a means of
getting the timeline to disassociate itself from the refresh driver before
it is destroyed. The version history seems to show this too:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/84169b40100b4248f0cbdfbd0e42e27e358d5e80>
So I think there are a few things we can do here:
1. Set a flag in DocumentTimeline::NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying to indicate
"refresh driver has been destroyed" and, in
DocumentTimeline::GetRefreshDriver(), return nullptr when that flag is set.
In DocumentTimeline::NotifyRefreshDriverCreated we would clear the flag.
2. Make DocumentTimeline::Unlink unregister from the refresh driver.
3. Make Animation::Unlink call DocumentTimeline->RemoveAnimation.
4. In ~DocumentTimeline unregister from the refresh driver.
(1) alone would fix this bug, but I think we should probably do something
along the lines of (2) or (3) or both as well. We probably don't need (4) and
can just leave the assertion there---or should we convert it to a MOZ\_CRASH?
For now I'll just do (1) and (2).

On further thought, while (1) would fix \*this\* bug, we could have a very similar bug which would not be fixed by (1) if instead of using the default document timeline, we use a separately constructed timeline (i.e. using `new DocumentTimeline`) since we won't call NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying on that. So probably the minimum requirement for fixing this is (2). I'll make these up as separate patches and we can decide which to land where.Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

Attached patch

[Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline](attachment.cgi?id=8781395&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8781395&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1291665&attachment=8781395)

This is approach (1) from [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1291665#c10 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in nsRefreshDriver::Tick"). I think [attachment 8781392](/attachment.cgi?id=8781392 "Unregister from refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::Unlink") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8781392&action=edit "Unregister from refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::Unlink") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8781392&action=diff "Unregister from refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::Unlink") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1291665&attachment=8781392) is enough and we don't need to land this patch to fix this bug.
However, I think it's a bug that we call NotifyRefreshDriverDestroyed and then sometimes re-register with it anyway.
We should either:
i. Not call NotifyRefreshDriverDestroyed from nsDocument::Reset
ii. Land this patch sometime.
(i) seems simpler but I'm not sure if eagerly disassociating from the refresh driver might have other benefits such as releasing resources sooner and stopping the refresh driver from spinning. On the other hand, perhaps it could be argued that the default document should keep functioning even after the document is destroyed (like document timelines created using `new DocumentTimeline`).
So I'm not quite sure what to do here, but I'm posting this patch for now since we might use it later.

It would be nice that we have a utility function which does;
refreshDriver->RemoveRefreshObserver(this, Flush\_Style);
mIsObservingRefreshDriver = false;
and reuse the function in NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying() or rename NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying in a later bug?

Unregister from refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::Unlink
I am sorry, I accidentally set r+ against the test case.

Unregister from refresh driver in DocumentTimeline::Unlink
[Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not too easily. It's clear the bug relates to failing to unregister from the refresh driver, but you have to be lucky with GC timing to trigger the bug (or find a way of forcing GC to happen at the right time--is there a way, other than using a chrome-privileges API to do that?).
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No, however they make it clear that sometimes we fail to unregister from the refresh driver (which one could easily guess implies a UAF).
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
At least up to 48. I believe this was introduced in [bug 1195180](/show_bug.cgi?id=1195180 "RESOLVED FIXED - Tick animations from their timeline") which landed in 44, so I expect ESR45 is affected.
> If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
([Bug 1195180](/show_bug.cgi?id=1195180 "RESOLVED FIXED - Tick animations from their timeline"))
> Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Not yet but I can easily prepare them. They should not be very different, very difficult to create, or risky.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely to cause regressions. I have yet to run it through try for fear of exposing the vulnerability. Please advise how to proceed.

Reporter
Multiple people
Impact
high
##### Description

Due to [flaws in the process we used to update "Preloaded Public Key Pinning"](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/09/16/update-on-add-on-pinning-vulnerability/) in our releases, the pinning for add-on updates became ineffective in early September. An attacker who was able to get a mis-issued certificate for a Mozilla web site could send malicious add-on updates to users on networks controlled by the attacker. Users who have not installed any add-ons are not affected.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Andrew McCreight, Dan Minor, Byron Campen, Jon Coppeard, Steve Fink, Tyson Smith, Philipp, and Carsten Book reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 48 and Firefox ESR 45.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

This seems to be a case that we need to call RequestRestyle(Layer) even if there is no animation properties changes. The trigger line which we need to call RequestRestyle(Layer) if there is no animation properties changes is
o577.style.position='absolute';
Before changeset c920a4fb4664, we had called RequestRestyle(Layer) (moreover we called SchedulePaint) whenever we call UpdateAnimations with old animations, but after the changeset, we don't call RequestRestyle(Layer) if there is no animation properties changes. As a result, nsCSSFrameConstructor::RecreateFramesForContent is not called when needed.
Yes, this bug, of course, is caused by web-animation. You can confirm it if you change 'o577.id='id2' to 'o577.animate({ opacity: [0, 1] }, 100)'.

I don't quite understand it yet. I just knew before that changeset, we called RequestRestyle(Layer), and this bug does not happen. So, I might be wrong.
Anyway, I think reframing process (I am not sure this word is right here) without RequestRestyle(Layer) does not invoked when needed in failure cases.

On debug build the test case causes an assertion:

I found the reason why calling RequestRestyle(Layer) does not cause this issue.
In restyling process between setTimeout() and 'o0.designMode='on'', CalcSyleDifference in CaptureChange returns NS\_STYLE\_HINT\_NONE instead of nsChangeHint\_ReconstructFrame, as a result, reframing is skipped, then the child id mismatch in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState") happens.
[1] <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/9b428173a088/layout/base/RestyleManager.cpp#l2780>
The reason why CalcSyleDifference returns NS\_STYLE\_HINT\_NONE is that PeekStyleDisplay() for the old style context is nullptr there. Actually the difference should be from position:fixed to position:absolute there (i.e., nsChangeHint\_ReconstructFrame). I don't know why the display is null yet.

The reason is that we are hit by this condition[1] in nsRuleNode::GetStyleData.
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/70e05c6832e8/layout/style/nsRuleNode.cpp#l10264>
We have an animation and a pseudo element 'o305=document.createTextNode("{}:first-line{")'.
I am going to investigate [bug 1181011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181011 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsFrame::DidSetStyleContext") which introduced this condition.

Attached patch

[Force to call RequestRestyle when we have animations inside an pseudo element](attachment.cgi?id=8768286&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8768286&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1282076&attachment=8768286)

I have no idea what we can tweak nsRuleNode::GetStyleData for this bug cases.
So, this patch calls RequestRestyle to force to do layout when we have animations inside a pseudo element even if there is no property changes.
This is a behavior what we did before c920a4fb4664, so it's basically no risk, it has only a performance impact but the impact should be relatively small.
I'd like to hear opinions from Cameron, but he will be away until July 10.

Force to call RequestRestyle when we have animations inside an pseudo element
In failure case, reparenting frame is not processed because RestyleManager::CaptureChange can not detect position style change from 'fixed' to 'absolute' due to nsStyleContext::CalcDifference in RestyleManager::CaptureChange does not return nsChangeHint\_ReconstructFrame. That's because because nsRuleNode::GetStyleData returns nullptr if the style has animation and is inside a pseudo-element.
Before this changeset, <https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/c920a4fb4664>, it did not appear since we called RequestRestyle(Layer), so reparenting frame was processed regardless of CaptureChange results.
This patch calls RequestRestyle(Layer) if we have animations inside a pseudo-element just like we did before, can be easily uplifted.
Cameron, what do you think of?

When CalcStyleData calls PeekStyleData, it interprets a nullptr return value as meaning "we don't care about this struct", since we never requested it, and therefore don't need to generate any change hints for it. However, it looks like the [bug 1181011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181011 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsFrame::DidSetStyleContext") changes violated that expectation. Normally, when we compute a reset struct, and the rule node decides that it can't be cached, we store the struct pointer on the style context:
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/bc94fc8653d9821caf87f5af0e2cd830a09ca8d3/layout/style/nsRuleNode.cpp#2843-2845>
If the rule node does decide it can be cached, we avoid storing the struct pointer on the style context (since the style context can just ask the rule node for it, and we can maybe avoid allocating nsRuleNode::mResetData).
The problem that [bug 1181011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181011 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsFrame::DidSetStyleContext") was intended to address was that a single nsRuleNode, for an animation rule, can represent different style data, depending on whether the style context is for something inside a pseudo-element or not. But the way we handle this is by still allowing the struct to be cached on the rule node (as long as its RuleNodeCacheConditions say it's OK), but then choosing not to return it from nsRuleNode::GetStyleData. That means we don't store the struct pointer on the style context, which means PeekStyleData thinks we never computed the struct.
So I think we should fix this problem, rather than solve the crash by forcing the restyle in the animation code. There are a couple of ways we could do it: we could always store reset struct pointers on the style context (even if cached unconditionally on the rule node) if we have animation data. Or we could add an "in a pseudo" value to RuleNodeCacheConditions to be used if the rule node has animation data, like I was going to do in [bug 1181011 comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181011#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsFrame::DidSetStyleContext") (though I'm not sure why that patch didn't work).
I think the former is the smaller change, so better for uplifting. This is a small memory increase for style contexts with animations on them.
(The better solution would be to do [bug 1181011 comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181011#c25 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsFrame::DidSetStyleContext"), which would use separate rule nodes for in-pseudo-animation-rule and not-in-pseudo-animation-rule, but that's a bigger change.)

Initially I couldn't not understand what you mean, especially where the reset struct pointers stores. After digging into the code, if I understand it correctly, I think you meant removing !(HasAnimationData() && ParentHasPseudoElementData(aContext)) in STYLE\_STRUCT\_RESET macro[1].

No, not removing this condition, since that would undo the fix from [bug 1181011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181011 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsFrame::DidSetStyleContext"). (It would mean that structs cached on the rule node get returned even if we have animation data in a pseudo-element, which was the problematic case.)
Here are all the places we currently cache a struct on the style context:
\* <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/92616e983b8ad6e99ec148f341e146c3c6fa312a/layout/style/nsStyleContext.h#601-604>

These are when we compute a new inherited struct, or get an existing one that was cached on the rule node. We always cache inherited structs on the style context.
\* <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/92616e983b8ad6e99ec148f341e146c3c6fa312a/layout/style/nsRuleNode.cpp#87-91>
This is when we get an existing reset struct that was cached on the rule node with conditions.
\* <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/92616e983b8ad6e99ec148f341e146c3c6fa312a/layout/style/nsRuleNode.cpp#2464-2473>
This is when we are computing a new struct (inherited or reset), but we find we can just inherit the same struct from the parent style context.
\* <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/92616e983b8ad6e99ec148f341e146c3c6fa312a/layout/style/nsRuleNode.cpp#2833-2841>

This is when we just computed a new reset struct, and it can't be cached on the rule node.
These last two are in COMPUTE\_END\_RESET, so just when we finished computing a new reset struct. It's the first case in this macro -- when we have a reset struct that can be cached on the rule node without conditions -- that we want to adjust so that it caches the struct on the style context too, if HasAnimationData() is true.Flags: needinfo?(cam)

Hmm, then I really don't understand it. In the test case in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState"), as far as I can confirm, COMPUTE\_END\_RESET for Display against an old nsStyleContext passed to CalcStyleDifferenct is not called between setTimeout() and 'o0.designMode='on'', it's called after document.execCommand('insertparagraph',false,null), but it's too late.

Maybe I misunderstood the problem then. Looking through the test case, I think the element in question -- o577, the <style> element -- should have its Display struct computed during the flush that happens inside the scrollByLines() call. Is this what happens? (I don't have a build handy to test right now.)

Yes, the style context at that time (the flush caused by scrollByLines) has a valid Display struct, but the style context is not the old style context passed to CalcStyleDifference.

On IRC, Cameron taught me a lot of things to debug this issue. I've been tracking down this issue with a fix suggested in [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState"). I am still in the middle way, but found some interesting facts.
\* Two style contexts are created for the same nsIFrame during the flush caused by scrollByLines().
\* The first one is maybe created in somewhere inside nsCSSFrameConstructor::ProcessChildren. This might be wrong, I couldn't track down where it exactly comes from.
\* The second one is created in RestyleManager::ReparentStyleContext.
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/08f8a5aacd83/layout/base/RestyleManager.cpp#l2385>
\* Two style context has the same rule node.
\* I don't know it's normal or not.
\* StyleDisplay() is called against both of the style context.
1. StyleDisplay() is called against the first style context.
2. It leads to call nsRuleNode::WalkRuleTree and then COMPUTE\_END\_RESET.
3. Display struct is stored in mStyleData.mResetData and is set against the \*first style context\*
4. The second style is generated.
5. StyleDisplay() is called against the second style context.
6. It leads to call nsRuleNode::WalkRuleTree but not call COMPUTE\_END\_RESET because ...
7. the rule node has the previous Display struct so we can get startStruct here, then ..
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/08f8a5aacd83/layout/style/nsRuleNode.cpp#l2343>
8. early return here
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/08f8a5aacd83/layout/style/nsRuleNode.cpp#l2431>
\* This second style context is a problematic style context. Its rule node has Display struct in mStyleData.mResetData but the style context itself does not have the Display struct. So
\* PeekStyleDisplay() against the second style context returns nullptr because the second style context does not have the Display struct in mCachedResetData and the style context has animations inside a pseudo element.
Now I am inclined to conclude this issue is not related [bug 1181011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181011 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsFrame::DidSetStyleContext"). I think the issue has been in our code before [bug 1181011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181011 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsFrame::DidSetStyleContext").
Two questions;
1) Is it normal behavior that multiple style contexts have the same rule node?
2) If so, don't we clear mStyleData.mResetData of the rule node when RestyleManager::ReparentStyleContext is called?
I should investigate further, but anyway, thank you Cameron for instructing me.

This is normal case when reparenting style context.

I found an important comment.
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/08f8a5aacd83/layout/base/RestyleManager.cpp#l2479>
In this test case, position style is changed after reparenting context. So a problem is inside position style code?

This was wrong. StyleDisplay() is called against other style context here　and it leads to call nsRuleNode::WalkRuleTree against the same rule node of the first style context. Maybe the style context for body element? I am confused.

I am sorry for the confusion. The StyleDisplay() is actually called against a style context for an animated element (id=id2 in the test case) but not associated with the same nsIFrame of the other two style context. I think this is the real first style context during ScrollByLines.

We were setting the Display struct to the rule node here. So calling nsStyleContext::SetStyle in COMPUTE\_END\_RESET is not effective unfortunately.

Attached patch

[Store the struct on the style context when we find the struct in cache inside WalkRuleTree](attachment.cgi?id=8771809&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8771809&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1282076&attachment=8771809)

Calling nsStyleContext::SetStyle() (with AddStyleBit) inside if (HasAnimationData()) check in STYLE\_STRUCT\_RESET, as Cameron suggested on IRC, causes memory leak (the struct pointer I think). I got an assertion here.
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/711963e8daa3/layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp#l840>
Calling nsStyleContext::SetStyle() without AddStyleBit causes another use-after-poison in nsStyleContext::StyleTextReset() in the test case [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState").
So I tried to move the call to nsRuleNode::GetStyleData(), and it failed with the same use-after-poison. And then I moved the call to the place just before returning the struct found in mResetData in nsRuleNode::WalkRuleTree(), it does not cause any errors as far as I confirmed. This patch is it.
To confirm that it does not cause any side-effets I did a try with this change.
<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=25fb69e1a8e8>
Of course our test cases might not cover failure cases, but I have no idea other than this.
Cameron, any thoughts?

OK, so just to summarize my understanding, here are the codepaths under nsRuleNode::GetStyleData that nsStyleContext::StyleData can call into to get a non-inherited struct.
1. We have a non-inherited struct already stored on the rule node, and it's not the problematic case of a rule node with animation data and pseudo-element data. We return the struct immediately, and don't set the bit. nsStyleContext::GetStyleData doesn't cache the struct on the style context.
==> This case needs changing, since we want all non-inherited structs that were stored on the rule node to be cached on the style context if we have animation data. (Though I suppose this is not the case that triggers the problem in this bug, as you've identified that one in [comment 26](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c26 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState").) To handle this, we can do
if (HasAnimationData()) {
aContext->AddStyleBit(...);
aContext->SetStyle(...);
}
like you do in your [comment 26](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c26 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState") patch.
2. nsRuleNode::GetStyleData calls into WalkRuleTree, and we return early with a struct from higher up in the rule tree (because we know that our rule node doesn't add any relevant properties), which is the case your [comment 26](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c26 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState") patch takes care of. This change looks right.
3. WalkRuleTree finds we have |inherit| specified for all properties in the struct, and we |return parentStruct|. The existing code there should be OK for non-inherited structs too.
4. We are computing structs for the root. This doesn't need special handling.
5. WalkRuleTree computes a new struct, and in COMPUTE\_END\_RESET we decide we can cache it without dependencies.
==> This case still needs changing, I think. We need a block just like the [comment 26](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c26 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState") patch in here too.
6. WalkRuleTree computes a new struct, and in COMPUTE\_END\_RESET we decide we can cache it with dependencies. The existing code here should be OK.
7. WalkRuleTree computes a new struct, and in COMPUTE\_END\_RESET we decide we can't cache it on the rule node. The existing code here should be OK as we explicitly cache the struct on the style context.
So basically, any time we either look up an existing non-inherited struct cached on the rule node, or the rule node computes a new one that gets cached on the rule node too, and HasAnimationData() is true, we need to cache on the style context too.
It sounds like from your previous comment that the #5 change above was causing a leak, but I'm not sure why that is. Can you show me the patch you had for that? Also please try a patch that handles all three of these cases. Thank you!

Actually the change which causes a leak is the change in STYLE\_STRUCT\_RESET macro.
<https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/4c8a65db67fa7bf0289b229dc788c4e9cf4762de#l2.14>
Though, in the changeset of the try, it also has a null check of newData, it results the same leak without the null check. I did also add aComputeData check, it didn't help either.

I think the nsStyleStruct.h change you have in your patch needs to go inside the if statement in nsRuleNode::GetStyleData. With the current location of that change, we will end up recording some newly computed structs that nsRuleNode returned with the bit set, meaning we won't delete it when the style context goes away.

We need to add this change to the macro-defined nsRuleNode::GetStyle##name\_ functions, too (which I forgot to mention).

(But only for the non-inherited struct ones defined with STYLE\_STRUCT\_RESET.)

[Store all non-inherited structs which are stored on the rule node on the style context if the we have animation data](attachment.cgi?id=8772662&action=diff) (obsolete)

Calling nsStyleContext's functions in nsRuleNode.h causes header inclusion hell. I had to add a static function.

Let's make this private, since we only need to call it from within nsRuleNode methods.

<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=19308801b3c0>
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
\* Not easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
\* No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
\* 45ESR. The test case in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState") does not affect 45ESR, but I think there are other cases to cause this use-after-poison on 45ESR. It will be more difficult to attack though.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
\* [Bug 1181011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181011 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsFrame::DidSetStyleContext").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
\* Yes. This patch can be applied to 45ESR.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
\* Not likely. It slightly increases memory consumption on sites that have animations, but it's negligible.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: [bug 1181011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181011 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsFrame::DidSetStyleContext")
[User impact if declined]: A security hole caused by use-after-poison.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: Not included in this patch. Two test cases (in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState") and [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState")) will land after this bug is in public. I've confirmed that both of the test cases work fine locally.
[Risks and why]: Low, it essentially increases memory consumption, but it's negligible.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None

Attached patch

[Crash tests](attachment.cgi?id=8793634&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8793634&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1282076&attachment=8793634)

Firefox 48 and ESR 45.4.0 have been released. Now I think it's time to land test cases.
This includes a test case in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1282076#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - use-after-poison in nsFrameManager::CaptureFrameState") and [attachment 8767517](/attachment.cgi?id=8767517 "Web animations' test case") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8767517&action=edit "Web animations' test case"). An interesting fact is that current mozilla-central does not cause this use-after-poison even if the fix ([attachment 8772704](/attachment.cgi?id=8772704 "Store all non-inherited structs which are stored on the rule node on the style context if the we have animation data") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8772704&action=edit "Store all non-inherited structs which are stored on the rule node on the style context if the we have animation data") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8772704&action=diff "Store all non-inherited structs which are stored on the rule node on the style context if the we have animation data") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1282076&attachment=8772704)) is reverted but it's worth to add test cases.

Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Andrew McCreight, Dan Minor, Byron Campen, Jon Coppeard, Steve Fink, Tyson Smith, Philipp, and Carsten Book reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird ESR 45.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a cross-platform web browser from Mozilla. The
Mozilla Thunderbird mail client is a redesign of the Mozilla Mail
component. The goal is to produce a cross-platform stand-alone mail
application using XUL (XML User Interface Language).

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox and
Thunderbird. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or cause a Denial of Service condition via
multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-45.6.0"

```

All Firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-45.6.0"

```

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-45.6.0"

```

All Thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-45.6.0"

```

Due to [flaws in the process we used to update "Preloaded Public Key Pinning"](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/09/16/update-on-add-on-pinning-vulnerability/) in our releases, the pinning for add-on updates became ineffective in early September. An attacker who was able to get a mis-issued certificate for a Mozilla web site could send malicious add-on updates to users on networks controlled by the attacker. Users who have not installed any add-ons are not affected.

#### [#CVE-2016-5257: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 49 and Firefox ESR 45.4](#CVE-2016-5257)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Andrew McCreight, Dan Minor, Byron Campen, Jon Coppeard, Steve Fink, Tyson Smith, Philipp, and Carsten Book reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 48 and Firefox ESR 45.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017
* 18 July 2017
* 17 October 2017
