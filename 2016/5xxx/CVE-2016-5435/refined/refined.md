- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory leak vulnerability exists in specific Huawei products when they are operating in a hot standby networking configuration where two devices are not directly connected. This occurs due to the improper handling of malformed packets.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a memory leak triggered by malformed packets.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exhaust the device's memory resources by sending a large number of malformed packets, leading to a device reboot (denial-of-service).

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, involving the transmission of specially crafted malformed packets.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    1.  The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
    2.  The vulnerable device must be in a hot standby network configuration where two devices are not directly connected.
