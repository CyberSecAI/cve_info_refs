Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-5255 from the provided content, which includes descriptions from multiple sources.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `js::PreliminaryObjectArray::sweep` function of Mozilla Firefox. This occurs during incremental garbage collection, when objects and pointers are not handled correctly within object groups under certain circumstances. Specifically, a minor GC can occur during an incremental GC cycle and incorrectly identify a tenured object as having already been swept (because the `IsAboutToBeFinalized` check does not account for such cases during a minor GC) resulting in a dangling pointer within an object group.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-after-free**: The core vulnerability is a use-after-free error. This happens when memory is deallocated, and a dangling pointer to this memory is later accessed, potentially causing a crash.
*   **Incorrect Garbage Collection Handling**: The garbage collection process in JavaScript doesn't properly track the state of objects during incremental collection.
*  **Heap memory corruption** This can result from writing to previously deallocated memory which corrupts the heap, and can result in a crash or other exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the browser.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application (heap memory corruption and application crash) if successful execution of arbitrary code is not obtained. This would prevent the application from functioning.
*    **Information Disclosure:** In some scenarios, the vulnerability may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information through memory inspection.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: Successfully exploiting the vulnerability can allow the attacker to elevate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted JavaScript:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious JavaScript code, which is mishandled during incremental garbage collection.
*   **Remote Attack:** Exploitation can be done remotely, which means that a user could be exposed through a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote**: The attacker needs to deliver malicious JavaScript code to the victim's Firefox browser via the internet.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit a website containing the malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Precise Timing (Complex Exploit):** Exploiting this vulnerability for code execution is difficult due to the timing requirements of the garbage collection process. The attacker would likely need a good understanding of the browser's memory layout.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was specifically found in `js::PreliminaryObjectArray::sweep()` function during incremental garbage collection.
*   The core of the issue lies in how `IsAboutToBeFinalized` checks whether objects are dead. During a minor collection, this check was not accounting for tenured objects when inside an object group that needed lazy sweeping. This resulted in an object group that contained dead object pointers, which were then accessed.

**Mitigation:**

*   Mozilla released Firefox 48 which includes a fix for the vulnerability.
*   The fix involves modifying `IsAboutToBeFinalized` to check whether tenured objects are dead during minor collections which prevents use-after-free conditions.

**Suse Specific details:**

* SUSE categorized the issue as 'moderate' severity, and provided patches across different SUSE enterprise product versions to resolve this vulnerability.
* The SUSE advisory references their internal bugzilla entry 991809.

**openSUSE Specific details:**
*   openSUSE issued a security update (openSUSE-SU-2016:1964-1 and openSUSE-SU-2016:2026-1) to address this issue as well as multiple other vulnerabilities by updating Mozilla Firefox to version 48.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by updating firefox, mozilla-nss.
*   openSUSE also lists this CVE in their security update for openSUSE 13.1 and leap 42.1

**Ubuntu Specific details:**
* Ubuntu released a security notice, USN-3044-1, which included a fix for CVE-2016-5255.
* Ubuntu lists this CVE as related to an issue in "firefox", their packaging name for the mozilla firefox browser.
* Patches were provided for Ubuntu 16.04, 14.04, and 12.04.

**Gentoo Specific details:**
* Gentoo issued GLSA 201701-15, which covered multiple vulnerabilities including CVE-2016-5255.
* The GLSA details that the firefox and thunderbird packages were affected.
*  Packages needed to be updated to version 45.6.0 or later in order to remediate the vulnerability.

**Mozilla Foundation Advisory 2016-71:**
*   Mozilla has also released their own advisory on this issue, as a crash in incremental garbage collection in JavaScript. They note the severity as "moderate".

This combined analysis highlights a moderately complex use-after-free vulnerability that could be used to cause a crash or lead to code execution if exploited properly. The main difficulty in exploiting it is timing the garbage collection correctly. This complexity is why Mozilla considers it "moderate" as it's unlikely to be something a casual actor can exploit without a great deal of effort, though a more sophisticated attacker may succeed in creating a working exploit.
