Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from HAProxy's incorrect handling of the `reqdeny` filter. Specifically, when a request is denied using `reqdeny`, a status message was being used uninitialized, which was meant to be populated with actions like `http-request deny` and `http-request tarpit`. This resulted in the usage of an uninitialized value within the denial code path, leading to unpredictable behaviour.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Usage of an uninitialized variable. The code was attempting to access a variable that hadn't been properly set when a denial occurred due to a `reqdeny` rule. This is a classic programming error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact was that a remote attacker could send specially crafted network traffic to HAProxy, triggering the vulnerability and causing the program to crash. This resulted in a denial of service, making the application unavailable. The crash could result in different behaviors such as a 200, an empty response, or a full process crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The attack vector is remote. A malicious actor can exploit the vulnerability by sending a request that triggers the `reqdeny` rule within HAProxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the HAProxy service. They do not need prior authentication or special permissions.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was introduced in HAProxy version 1.6.0.
- The fix was implemented in a commit that will become version 1.6.6 of HAProxy.
- Ubuntu has provided a patch in version `1.6.3-1ubuntu0.1` for Ubuntu 16.04.
