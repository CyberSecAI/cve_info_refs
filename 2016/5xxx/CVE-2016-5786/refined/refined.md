The content is related to CVE-2016-5786.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The OmniView web application transmits credentials using the HTTP protocol (unencrypted).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319) - Credentials sent over HTTP, making them vulnerable to sniffing.
*   Weak password requirements (CWE-521) - Insufficient password complexity requirements allowing for brute-force attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Compromise of account credentials.
*   Potential for an attacker to control the operation of backup generators connected to the compromised account.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote exploitation possible through network access to the web application.
*   Sniffing network traffic to intercept credentials transmitted in cleartext via HTTP.
*   Brute-forcing weak passwords to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Network access to the OmniView web application.
*   Low skill level required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
