Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect check of Subject Alternative Names (SANs) during Certificate Authority Access Control List (CA ACL) verification in FreeIPA. Specifically, when a certificate request included a SAN, the code was not properly checking if the specified SAN name was authorized to be used with the specified profile ID, especially for service principals.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect SAN Checking:**  The primary weakness is that the CA ACL check for SANs was not performed correctly, especially in the case of service principals. It was checking the original principal instead of the alternate principal derived from SAN.
*   **Bypass of CA ACLs:**  Due to the incorrect check, it was possible to bypass the intended CA ACL restrictions.
*   **Arbitrary SAN Names for Services:** The flaw allowed an attacker to request a certificate with an arbitrary SAN name for service principals, violating the principle of least privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Certificate Issuance:** An attacker could obtain certificates that they were not authorized to create, by adding a malicious SubjectAltName.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By requesting certificates with arbitrary SAN names for service principals, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges within the FreeIPA domain, if those certificates are trusted by a service.
*   **Compromise of Services:**  Compromised certificates could be used to impersonate or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Certificate Signing Request (CSR):** An attacker would craft a CSR with a malicious SubjectAltName.
*   **FreeIPA API:** The attacker would submit the CSR to the FreeIPA server via its API or a similar interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker would likely need to be an authenticated user within the FreeIPA domain.
*   **Access to FreeIPA API:** Access to a client that can interact with the FreeIPA certificate management API is necessary.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerable code was introduced in FreeIPA 4.4.0.
*   The issue was fixed by ensuring the CA ACL check is performed against the alternative principal when SubjectAltNames are present.
*   The fix involves a patch to the `ipaserver/plugins/cert.py` file, correcting how the alternate principal is checked against the CA ACLs.
