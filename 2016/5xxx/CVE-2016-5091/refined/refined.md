Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing access check in the Extbase component of TYPO3 CMS. This allows attackers to bypass intended access controls when executing Extbase actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Access Control:** The core issue is the failure of Extbase to properly validate user permissions when handling requests for controller/action combinations. This oversight allows unauthorized execution of actions.
*   **Unrestricted Action Execution:**  Attackers can craft special requests to trigger arbitrary Extbase actions due to the missing access check, leading to potentially malicious actions being performed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Depending on the exploited action, the vulnerability can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain scenarios, the ability to execute arbitrary Extbase actions can result in remote code execution, granting attackers significant control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests designed to invoke unauthorized Extbase actions.
*   **Publicly Available Extbase Actions:** If the TYPO3 installation has publicly accessible Extbase actions, the vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.
*   **Authenticated Backend Users:** Even if no public Extbase actions are available, authenticated backend users with access to a backend module that uses Extbase can also exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Knowledge of HTTP Requests:** Attackers need to be able to craft malicious HTTP requests.
*   **Access to an Extbase Plugin or Module:** Attackers need some way to reach and trigger at least one Extbase plugin or module action within the TYPO3 installation, either publicly or via authenticated backend access.
*  **No authentication needed** if there's publicly available Extbase action
*  **Backend Authentication** If there's no publicly available Extbase action, attacker need to authenticate as a backend user

**Summary of Vulnerability Information:**
The vulnerability lies in the TYPO3 CMS's Extbase component where access control checks are missing. By crafting special requests, attackers can execute arbitrary Extbase actions. This can lead to information disclosure or remote code execution. Attackers either need to have access to a publicly available Extbase action or be a backend user with access to Extbase. The fix involves updating to a patched version of TYPO3 CMS.
