{
  "CVE-2016-5135": {
    "Description": "The Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82, does not consider referrer-policy information inside an HTML document during a preload request, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism via a crafted web site, as demonstrated by a \"Content-Security-Policy: referrer origin-when-cross-origin\" header that overrides a \"<META name='referrer' content='no-referrer'>\" element.",
    "Root cause": "The HTMLPreloadScanner in Blink does not take into account the referrer-policy specified within the HTML document during preload requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Content Security Policy (CSP) bypass",
      "Improper handling of referrer policy during preload requests"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections, which could lead to cross-site scripting or other attacks.",
    "Attack vector": "The attack vector is a crafted website that exploits this vulnerability.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website and trick a user into visiting the site. They need knowledge of how to craft the HTML to exploit the vulnerable HTMLPreloadScanner."
    }
