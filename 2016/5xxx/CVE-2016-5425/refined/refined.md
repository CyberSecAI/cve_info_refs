{
  "CVE-2016-5425": {
    "Root cause": "The tomcat.conf file, installed by Tomcat packages on RedHat-based systems, has write permissions for the tomcat group.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file permissions on /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf.",
       "The systemd-tmpfiles service processes configuration files without stopping on syntax errors."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation from tomcat group user to root. An attacker with tomcat user privileges can modify /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf, inject malicious configuration, and gain root privileges when the systemd-tmpfiles service runs.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to the system by a user belonging to tomcat group.",
      "Remote exploitation through a vulnerable web application hosted on Tomcat that allows writing to arbitrary files"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to write files with tomcat user permissions, either through a compromised tomcat user account or a vulnerable web application running under the tomcat user. No special capabilities/position needed once a tomcat-group write capability is obtained."
  }
