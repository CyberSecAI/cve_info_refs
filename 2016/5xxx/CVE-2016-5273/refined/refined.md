Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-5273:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the `mozilla::a11y::HyperTextAccessible::GetChildOffset` function during accessibility processing.
- The issue is related to how the accessibility tree is updated when DOM tree removals occur. Specifically, a sequence of DOM manipulations involving iframes and framesets triggers a crash within the mentioned function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Crash:** The primary vulnerability is a crash (specifically a SEGV - segmentation violation) in the mentioned function.
- **Potentially exploitable:** The description indicates it's a "potentially exploitable crash", suggesting the possibility of turning it into a more severe exploit.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash in the browser, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential arbitrary code execution:** The "potentially exploitable" nature of the crash suggests that with further investigation and exploitation, it could be possible for an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious web page:** The vulnerability can be triggered through a specially crafted HTML page.
- **DOM manipulation:** The attack involves manipulating the DOM structure, specifically using iframes and framesets, to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve or have a victim load a malicious web page.
- The attacker needs to understand the DOM manipulation sequence to trigger the specific code path that results in the crash.
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the victim's machine.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found by Nils and was initially classified as a `sec-high` issue.
- It was fixed by resolving Bug 1286598, which addressed updating the accessible tree upon DOM removals.
- The crash was latent until Bug 1255009 which changed how children are inserted into the tree.
- The fix was included in Firefox 49 and later versions.
- There was discussion about whether to backport the fix to the ESR (Extended Support Release) version 45 branch but ultimately, it was deemed as "unaffected" due to the lack of a way to trigger it on that branch via the original test case.
- The vulnerability was assigned the alias CVE-2016-5273.
