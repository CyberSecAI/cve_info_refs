Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5351:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the IEEE 802.11 dissector in Wireshark. The dissector was not properly validating the size of the EAPOL body, specifically the EAPOL_RSN_KEY structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient input validation:** The Wireshark dissector was assuming that the EAPOL body would always contain a complete `EAPOL_RSN_KEY` structure. It wasn't checking if the provided body length was sufficient to accommodate this structure before attempting to access it.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** If a malformed packet with an EAPOL body shorter than the size of `EAPOL_RSN_KEY` was encountered, the dissector would attempt to read past the bounds of the provided data, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the Wireshark application. This can be triggered either by injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by opening a capture file containing a malformed packet.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network injection:** An attacker can inject a crafted IEEE 802.11 packet with a truncated EAPOL body into a network being monitored by Wireshark.
*   **Malicious capture files:** An attacker can create a capture file that contains a crafted IEEE 802.11 packet with a truncated EAPOL body and convince a user to open it with Wireshark.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** An attacker needs to be in a position to inject network traffic (in the case of live capture).
*   **File access:** An attacker needs to be able to send the malformed capture file to a user (in the case of file opening).
*   **Basic packet crafting knowledge:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a packet with a modified EAPOL body.

**Additional details:**

* The fix involved adding a check to ensure the EAPOL body was at least the size of the `EAPOL_RSN_KEY` structure before attempting to read data from it.
*   The vulnerability was present in Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.3 and 1.12.0 to 1.12.11, and was fixed in versions 2.0.4 and 1.12.12.
*   The commit that fixed this vulnerability is located at [https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/commit/9b0b20b8d5f8c9f7839d58ff6c5900f7e19283b4](https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/commit/9b0b20b8d5f8c9f7839d58ff6c5900f7e19283b4).
