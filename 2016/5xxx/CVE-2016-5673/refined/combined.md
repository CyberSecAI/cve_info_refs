## UltraVNC repeater does not restrict IP addresses or ports by default

#### Vulnerability Note VU#735416

Original Release Date: 2016-08-08 | Last Revised: 2016-08-08

---

### Overview

UltraVNC repeater versions prior to ultravnc\_repeater\_1300 do not restrict usage by IP address by default and cannot restrict by ports, which may be leveraged to induce connections to arbitrary hosts using any port.

### Description

| [**CWE-16**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/16.html)**: Configuration** -CVE-2016-5673  UltraVNC [repeater](http://www.uvnc.com/products/uvnc-repeater.html) acts as a proxy to route remote desktop VNC connections. IP addresses are not restricted in default configurations, and ports cannot be selectively restricted. Consequently, in a default installation, a repeater can be caused to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts using any port. To initiate a connection to a common web service, for instance, an attacker may request a connection to <IP>::<80><padding>, where padding consists of null bytes and the request length is 250 bytes. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may induce a default-configured repeater to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts and services. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update repeater configuration**New installations of UltraVNC repeater now default to restricting access to all IP addresses and support more granular port restrictions. Existing installations should consider updating to ultravnc\_repeater\_1300, review the vendor's [advisory,](http://www.uvnc.com/downloads/repeater/83-repeater-downloads.html) and make modifications as appropriate:*"WARNING:  In MODE I the repeater works like a proxy.  If you don't limit the destination and or ports your repeater can be used to connect to all ip adresses and all ports that can be reached from the repeater.**You need to restrict the ip addreses and ports to prevent unwanted access."* |
