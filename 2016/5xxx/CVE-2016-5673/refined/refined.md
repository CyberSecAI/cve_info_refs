- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The UltraVNC repeater, acting as a proxy for VNC connections, does not restrict IP addresses or ports by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper default configuration: IP addresses are not restricted in default configurations.
    - Lack of port restriction: Ports cannot be selectively restricted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can induce a default-configured repeater to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts and services. This can allow an attacker to use the repeater as a proxy to reach internal services or external resources.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted request to the repeater, causing it to connect to a specified IP address and port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the UltraVNC repeater. No authentication is required.
