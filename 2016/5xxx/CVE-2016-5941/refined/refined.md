- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application allows for directory traversal using "dot dot" sequences (/../) in URL requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to view arbitrary files on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a specially-crafted URL containing "dot dot" sequences (/../) to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a low privileged account.
