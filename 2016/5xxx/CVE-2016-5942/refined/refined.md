- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code to be embedded in the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can alter the intended functionality of the Web UI and potentially lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a low level of privilege on the system (PR:L) and needs user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability.
