Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-5840

**Vulnerability Description:**
Trend Micro Deep Discovery Inspector versions 3.0 to 3.8 SP1 (3.81) are vulnerable to remote code execution. The vulnerability lies in the `hotfix_upload.cgi` script, specifically due to insufficient input validation of the filename parameter before it's passed to a system call.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation in the `hotfix_upload.cgi` script. The script fails to sanitize the filename parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into a system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient Input Validation: The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly validate the filename provided during the hotfix upload process.
- Command Injection: The lack of input validation leads to command injection, where attacker-controlled input is interpreted as commands by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with root privileges.
- Full System Compromise: The ability to execute code as root enables an attacker to completely compromise the affected system, leading to data breaches, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `hotfix_upload.cgi` script.
- Specifically, the filename parameter within the multipart form data of the POST request to `hotfix_upload.cgi` is used to inject malicious commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication:  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (administrator) to exploit this vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable system.
- Understanding of the vulnerable script: The attacker must know the exact location and how to craft malicious requests to `hotfix_upload.cgi`.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the filename parameter of the uploaded file in hotfix_upload.cgi.
- Attackers can inject commands into the filename, which is then passed to a system call, resulting in command execution on the server.
- Special characters like '/', '<', and '>' are not directly passed to the server, but they can be introduced using environment variables, such as `echo $PATH | cut -c1` to print '/'.
- Attackers can upload a shell script using this vulnerability, then execute it to obtain a reverse shell.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity (CVSS v2 score of 9.0).
- Trend Micro has released a patch to fix this vulnerability.
- Exploit examples show how an attacker can execute simple non-interactive commands and create a reverse shell using the vulnerability.
