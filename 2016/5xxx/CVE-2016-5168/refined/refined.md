Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-5168:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a side-channel information leak in Skia.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Side-channel information leak: This type of vulnerability exploits information leaked through side effects of the system’s operation, rather than directly through the data itself. In this case, it's within the Skia graphics library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Information Leak: The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially gain access to sensitive information by analyzing the side effects of Skia’s operations. This can include timing differences, power consumption variations, or other indirect data leaks.
*   The impact is considered "Low".

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability lies within the Skia graphics library, meaning the attack vector would involve exploiting a weakness in how Skia processes data. This could happen through a crafted image or graphic that triggers the information leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would need a way to make the system perform Skia operations. This likely means the attacker needs to be able to display/process content containing graphics using the vulnerable Skia library.
*   The attacker would require the capability to observe and analyze side-channel information, which may be indirect and require specialized techniques.
