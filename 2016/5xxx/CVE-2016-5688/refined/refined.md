Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper input validation and error handling within the WPG (WordPerfect Graphics) image parser in ImageMagick. Specifically, the issue arises because a `SetImageExtent` check was placed in the wrong location within the code, and also was missing proper error handling, resulting in heap overflows and invalid memory writes. These issues are triggered when a memory limit is set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap overflow: Occurs due to incorrect size calculations or missing checks when allocating memory for image data.
- Invalid memory writes: Arise from out-of-bounds writes to memory locations, often stemming from incorrect size handling or logic errors in pixel data manipulation.
- Missing Input Validation: Improper checking of image extents (dimensions) before memory allocation and data processing.
- Incorrect Error Handling: Not properly handling the return values of the `SetImageExtent` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
- Heap corruption: Overwriting critical data in the heap, which can lead to program crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- Arbitrary memory writes: Writing to memory locations not intended by the program, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or potential security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted WPG image file: An attacker could create a WPG file with specific properties that trigger the vulnerability when processed by ImageMagick.
- File upload/processing: A vulnerable application that uses ImageMagick to process user-uploaded WPG images could be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted WPG file to ImageMagick for processing.
- The target system needs to have ImageMagick installed and configured to process WPG files.
- The vulnerability is more easily triggered when memory limits are set in ImageMagick's configuration.

**Technical Details:**

The commits `fc43974d34318c834fbf78570ca1a3764ed8c7d7` and `aecd0ada163a4d6c769cec178955d5f3e9316f2f` address this vulnerability.

- `fc43974d34318c834fbf78570ca1a3764ed8c7d7` specifically adds checks to ensure that the image extent does not exceed the maximum allowed. The changes are made in `coders/wpg.c`, adding a call to `SetImageExtent` before processing the image data.

- `aecd0ada163a4d6c769cec178955d5f3e9316f2f` modifies the `MagickCore/cache.c` and `MagickCore/image.c` files, setting the pixel cache to undefined if any resource limit is exceeded, this seems to be the fix for incorrect error handling.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-5688 describes a vulnerability in the WPG image parser of ImageMagick that can cause heap overflows and invalid memory writes due to insufficient input validation and incorrect error handling. The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted WPG file, leading to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution. The patches introduced by the commits mentioned above fix the vulnerability by adding proper input validation and error handling, ensuring that the image extents do not exceed limits, and cleaning up pixel caches on resource exhaustion.
