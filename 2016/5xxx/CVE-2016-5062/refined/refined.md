The provided content is related to CVE-2016-5062.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Aternity server allows remote loading of Java MBeans using the `getMBeansFromURL` method without proper authentication due to a misconfiguration of JMX RMI services. Specifically, the server has the JMX RMI service configured with `com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false` and `com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false`, disabling both password authentication and SSL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere (CWE-829): The server allows remote loading of Java MBeans from untrusted sources.
- Improper Authentication: Lack of authentication before allowing the execution of the `getMBeansFromURL` method.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: A remote attacker can register attacker-controlled MBeans (Java classes), which can invoke Java language functionality, including system commands. This can lead to remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: A remote attacker can exploit the JMX RMI service over the network.
- Exploitation of the `getMBeansFromURL` method without prior authentication allows for remote execution of arbitrary code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote access to the Aternity server's JMX RMI service.
- Knowledge of (or ability to guess) the port number and host name.
- Ability to create and host a malicious MBean.
