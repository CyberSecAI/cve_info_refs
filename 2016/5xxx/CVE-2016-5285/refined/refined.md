    "summary": "The provided documents describe CVE-2016-5285, a NULL pointer dereference flaw in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS). The vulnerability occurs due to a missing NULL check in `PK11_SignWithSymKey` or `ssl3_ComputeRecordMACConstantTime`, which can be triggered by a remote client sending an invalid Diffie-Hellman key. This can lead to a server crash resulting in a denial of service.",
