- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience web portal is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, thus altering the intended functionality and potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: Embedding malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker needs to be a user with the ability to embed the malicious code. User interaction is required to trigger the execution of the malicious script (UI:R).
