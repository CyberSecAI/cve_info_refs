Okay, let's break down the information related to CVE-2016-5636 from the provided documents.

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `zipimporter` module of CPython.
- It arises due to an integer overflow in the `get_data` function in `zipimport.c` when the `data_size` value is -1. Specifically, if `compress != 0`, then `bytes_size = data_size + 1` where `data_size` is not sanitized, leading to a wrap around of `bytes_size` to 0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- Insufficient input validation/sanitization of data\_size.
- Use of a possibly untrusted input value to determine the size of allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution.
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can create a specially crafted zip file with a data\_size value of -1.
- This malicious zip file needs to be placed in a module path where it will be loaded by a later "import" statement.
- Then by calling `zipimporter.get_data` with the malformed zip file will trigger the overflow, enabling an attacker to cause denial of service or achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be able to create a malicious zip file with a specific `data_size` value.
- Attacker must be able to place the zip file in a location where it will be loaded by a vulnerable Python application.
- The vulnerable python code must then call the `zipimporter.get_data` on the malformed zip file to trigger the overflow.

**Additional details from the provided information:**

-   **SUSE information:**  SUSE rates this issue as having moderate severity.  They provide both CVSS v2 and v3 scores. SUSE also includes links to several related advisories. SUSE indicates that this issue is resolved.
-  **openwall.com**: This source includes information about the heap overflow and a pointer to the Python bug tracker.
-  **Red Hat:** Red Hat rates the security impact of this issue as low. They mention that the vulnerability is in the built-in zipimporter.
- **Mitigation**: It is mentioned that this can be fixed by updating to the patched versions.

It's important to note that some sources dispute the severity of the issue, especially regarding the possibility of arbitrary code execution via a remote network.  However, the consensus is that the core vulnerability exists and can cause a denial-of-service.

The provided content also includes a list of affected and fixed packages in various SUSE and openSUSE products as well as links to Red Hat Security Advisories and other supporting materials. It also includes information about the vulnerability affecting multiple Python versions, 2.7.x, 3.4.x and 3.5.x.
