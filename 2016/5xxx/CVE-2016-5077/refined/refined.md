{
  "CVE-2016-5077": {
    "Root cause": "The Netikus EventSentry Network Management System (NMS) is vulnerable to persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of SNMP trap messages.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
       "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious actor can inject JavaScript and HTML code into the EventSentry web management interface via SNMP trap messages. When this malicious data is viewed within the web console, the code executes within the context of the authenticated user. This could lead to attacks that modify system configuration, compromise data, take control of the product, or attack the authenticated user's host system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through sending a crafted SNMP trap message to the EventSentry server. The crafted message contains malicious HTML or JavaScript code which is then stored and rendered in the web console.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the EventSentry server to send the malicious SNMP trap message. No prior authentication is required."
