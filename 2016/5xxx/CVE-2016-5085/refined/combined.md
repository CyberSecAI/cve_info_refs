# R7-2016-07: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Animas OneTouch Ping Insulin Pump

* Oct 04, 2016
* 7 min read
* [Tod Beardsley](/blog/author/tod-beardsley/)

*Last updated at Tue, 03 Sep 2024 19:45:32 GMT*

Today we are announcing three vulnerabilities in the Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump system, a popular pump with a blood glucose meter that services as a remote control via RF communication. Before we get into the technical details, we want to flag that we believe the risk of wide scale exploitation of these insulin pump vulnerabilities is relatively low, and we don't believe this is cause for panic. We recommend that users of the devices consult their healthcare providers before making major decisions regarding the use of these devices. More on that further down in this post.

Users should also be receiving notification of this issue, along with details for mitigating it, directly from Animas Corporation, via physical mail. We recommend you pay close attention to this communication.

### **Product description**

The OneTouch Ping is a popular medical device used by diabetic patients to self-administer insulin. According to the vendor's [website](https://www.animas.com/diabetes-insulin-pump-and-bloog-glucose-meter/onetouch-ping-blood-glucose-monitor), it is a "two-part system" that "communicates wirelessly to deliver insulin." The two devices communicate in the 900mhz band using a proprietary management protocol.

### **Summary of findings**

The OneTouch Ping insulin pump system uses cleartext communications rather than encrypted communications, in its proprietary wireless management protocol. Due to this lack of encryption, Rapid7 researcher Jay Radcliffe discovered that a remote attacker can spoof the Meter Remote and trigger unauthorized insulin injections.

Due to these insulin vulnerabilities, an adversary within sufficient proximity (which can depend on the radio transmission equipment being used) can remotely harm users of the system and potentially cause them to have hypoglycemic reaction, if he or she does not cancel the insulin delivery on the pump.

These issues have been reported to the vendor, Animas Corporation, CERT/CC, the FDA and DHS. Animas has been highly responsive and is proactively notifying users of the devices, and recommending mitigations for the risks.

### **Findings and analysis**

Three major findings were discovered during the analysis of the product. For raw, uncommented packet data, please see the addendum at the end of this advisory.

##### R7-2016-07.1: Communications transmitted in cleartext (CVE-2016-5084)

Packet captures demonstrate that the communications between the remote and the pump are transmitted in the clear. During the normal course of operation, de-identified blood glucose results and insulin dosage data is being leaked out for eavesdroppers to remotely receive.

##### R7-2016-07.2: Weak pairing between remote and pump (CVE-2016-5085)

There is a pairing process that is done during the setup of the pump that partners the pump with a remote. This is to prevent the pump from taking commands from other remotes that it might accidentally pick up transmissions from. The pairing process is done through a 5 packet exchange in the clear where the two devices exchange serial numbers and some header information. This is used to generate a CRC32 "key" (for lack of a better term). This key is used by the remote and pump in all future transmissions and is transmitted in the clear. The 5 packets are identical every time pairing process is done between the remote and insulin pump. This eliminates the possibility of the devices using encryption. Animas patent documents do not outline what exactly is used in the CRC generation, but it includes no encryption.

Attackers can trivially sniff the remote/pump key and then spoof being the remote or the pump. This can be done without knowledge of how the key is generated. This vulnerability can be used to remotely dispense insulin and potentially cause the patient to have a hypoglycemic reaction.

##### R7-2016-07.3: Lack of replay attack prevention or transmission assurance (CVE-2016-5086)

Communication between the pump and remote have no sequence numbers, timestamps, or other forms of defense against replay attacks. Because of this, attackers can capture remote transmissions and replay them later to perform an insulin bolus without special knowledge, which can potentially cause them to have hypoglycemic reaction.

In addition, the protocol the remote meter and pump use to communicate does not have elements that guarantee the devices have received the packets in a certain order or at all. It is believed that the weakness in this protocol would allow an attacker to perform a spoofed remote attack from a considerable distance from the user/patient. This would be done by a sufficiently powered remote sending commands to the pump in the blind, without needing to hear the acknowledgement packets.

This video demonstrates an attack on the Animas OneTouch Ping.

### **Attack range**

The OneTouch Ping does not communicate on 802.11 WiFi, or otherwise communicate on the internet. However, it is believed these attacks could be performed from one to two kilometers away, if not substantially further, using sufficient elevation and off-the-shelf radio transmission gear available to ham radio hobbyists.

While the normal use case between the remote and pump is approximately 10 meters. In 2011, Barnaby Jack of McAfee, Inc. claimed an ability to perform a 900mHz band attack from 90 meters away with an external directional antenna (a commercial 3 element yagi), however he did not execute this attack against the OneTouch Ping.

### **Mitigations**

Using industry standard encryption with a unique key pair would mitigate these issues.

Affected users can avoid these issues entirely by disabling the radio (RF) functionality of the device. On the OneTouch Ping Insulin Pump, this is done through the Setup -> Advanced -> Meter/10 screen, and selecting "RF = OFF".

In addition, the vendor has provided other mitigations for these issues, described on their website and in letters being sent to all patients using the pump and health care professionals.

Patients should consult with their own endocrinologist about any aspect of their ongoing medical care.

### **Researcher's note regarding mitigations**

I am [Jay Radcliffe](https://twitter.com/jradcliffe02), security researcher at Rapid7 and Type I diabetic. Five years ago when I first disclosed security vulnerabilities in an insulin device, I was shocked and overwhelmed with the number of concerned users that came to me looking for advice and help. Here we are again with new research on a medical device. If you are not technical and read the security advisory, you are probably more than worried. I would be too. So let me help clarify and explain some things from a patient perspective. Know that the device I did 90% of my research on, was the device I had attached to me for several years; I know how important this device is to a diabetic's health.

First, know that we take risks every day. We leave the house. We drive a car. We eat a muffin. We guess the amount of carbs. All entail risk. This research uncovers a previously unknown risk. This is similar to saying that there is risk of an asteroid hitting you, a car accident occurring or miscalculating the amount of insulin for that muffin you ate. Some of those risks are low (asteroid) some are high (insulin). This knowledge of risk allows individuals to make personal decisions. Most people are at limited risk of any of the issues related to this research. These are sophisticated attacks that require being physically close to a pump. Some people will choose to see this as significant, and for that they can turn off the rf/remote features of the pump and eliminate that risk.

Second, always take care of your diabetes first. We all know the dangers of high blood sugar and low blood sugar too. These risks often far outweigh the risks highlighted in this research. If you are concerned, work with your endocrinologist and device vendor to make sure you are making the best choices. Removing an insulin pump from a diabetic over this risk is similar to never taking an airplane because it might crash.

Third, this research is done to make sure the future of our devices are safe. As these devices get more advanced, and eventually connect to the internet (directly or indirectly), the level of risk goes up dramatically. This research highlights why it is so important to wait for vendors, regulators and researchers to fully work on these highly complex devices. This is not something to be rushed into as there is a patient's life on the line. We all want the best technology right away, but done in a reckless, haphazard way puts the whole process back for everyone.

I do not pump right now. I take shots manually. Not because of the security risks of insulin pumps, but because that is what my doctor and I have chosen. If any of my children became diabetic and the medical staff recommended putting them on a pump, I would not hesitate to put them on an OneTouch Ping. It is not perfect, but nothing is. In this process I have worked with Animas and its parent company, Johnson & Johnson, and know that they are focused on taking care of the patient and doing what is right.

Finally, please know that neither Animas nor Johnson & Johnson has paid me or Rapid7 for any of the research done on the device described here. This is just the advice of one parent and a person who has spent 17 years counting carbs and taking a risk on how much insulin is right.

## Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#884840

Original Release Date: 2016-10-04 | Last Revised: 2016-10-11

---

### Overview

The Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump contains multiple vulnerabilities that may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to obtain patient treatment or device data, or execute commands on the device. The attacker cannot obtain personally identifiable information.

### Description

| [**CWE-319**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)**: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information -** CVE-2016-5084  The Animas OneTouch insulin pump transmits patient treatment data and device data such as encryption passwords over the network in cleartext. An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to sniff all associated wireless transmissions from the device.According to Johnson and Johnson, parent company of Animas:*"**Information between the pump and meter is unencrypted, which could allow a malicious actor to capture patient treatment data, however this data does not include personally identifiable information."*[**CWE-330**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)**: Use of Insufficiently Random Values** - CVE-2016-5085The Animas OneTouch insulin pump uses a CRC32 checksum as if it were an encryption key. This value then does not change between authentication handshakes between the same device and remote station. According to Animas and Rapid7, "A malicious actor may be able to listen to communication between the pump and meter remote and obtain the necessary information to spoof being the meter remote."[**CWE-294**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay** - CVE-2016-5086The Animas OneTouch insulin pump uses a custom communication protocol that does not provide sufficient protections to guard against capture-replay attacks. According to Animas and Rapid7, "Once a malicious actor has spoofed being the meter remote, he/she could learn commands a patient initiate from the meter remote to the pump and attempt to replay them from a device other than the meter remote to the pump. Please refer to the mitigation section [see Resolution below] for details on controls in place to reduce this risk."[**CWE-290**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing** - CVE-2016-5686 The Animas OneTouch insulin pump uses a custom communications protocol that does not provide sufficient protections to guard against spoofed responses. Reportedly, it may be possible for an unauthenticated remote attacker to spoof acknowledgement packets to perform actions or commands on the device, or cause a remote to believe an acknowledgement was received after performing a command. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to sniff patient treatment or device data from communications, or execute commands on the device and/or remote, or prevent actions from occurring by spoofing acknowledgement packets. The attacker cannot obtain personally identifying information. |

### Solution

| Johnson and Johnson has provided the following statement:*"There are no plans to release a firmware update, however a notification is being sent to patients and HealthCare Professionals. In addition, there are a number of documented and proprietary mitigating controls in place to ensure the safe delivery of insulin, outlined below.**i.\tIf patients are concerned about unauthorized access for any reason, the pump’s radio frequency feature can be turned off, which is explained in Chapter 2 of Section III of the OneTouch® Ping® Owner’s Booklet. However, turning off this feature means that the pump and meter will no longer communicate and blood glucose readings will need to be entered manually on the pump.**ii.\tIf patients choose to use the meter remote feature, another option for protection is to program the OneTouch® Ping® pump to limit the amount of bolus insulin that can be delivered. Bolus deliveries can be limited through a number of customizable settings (maximum bolus amount, 2-hour amount, and total daily dose). Any attempt to exceed or override these settings will trigger a pump alarm and prevent bolus insulin delivery. For more information, please see Chapter 10 of Section I of the OneTouch® Ping® Owner’s Booklet.* *iii.\tThe company also suggests turning on the Vibrating Alert feature of the OneTouch® Ping® System, as described in Chapter 4 of Section I. This notifies the user that a bolus dose is being initiated by the meter remote, which gives the patient the option of canceling the bolus.* *iv.\tThe bolus delivery alert and the customizable limits on bolus insulin can only be enabled on the pump and cannot be altered by the meter remote. This is also true of basal insulin. Patients can also be reminded that any insulin delivery and the source of the delivery (pump or meter remote) are recorded in the pump history, so patients can review the bolus dosing."* |

## MITIGATION

Animas does not plan to release a firmware update to address the identified vulnerabilities. Animas reports that customer notifications are being sent to patients and HealthCare professionals, which is available on Animas’ web site at the following location:

<https://www.animas.com/sites/default/files/pdf/FINAL%20Letter%20to%20patients%20regarding%20OTP_10.04.16.16_WEB%20VERSION.PDF>.

Animas has provided the following compensating controls to help reduce the risk associated with the exploitation of the identified vulnerabilities:

* The pump’s radio frequency feature can be turned off, which is explained in Chapter 2 of Section III of the OneTouch Ping Owner’s Booklet. However, turning off this feature means that the pump and meter remote will no longer communicate and blood glucose readings will need to be entered manually on the pump.
* If patients choose to use the meter remote feature, another option for protection is to program the OneTouch Ping pump to limit the amount of bolus insulin that can be delivered. Bolus deliveries can be limited through a number of customizable settings (maximum bolus amount, 2-hour amount, and total daily dose). Any attempt to exceed or override these settings will trigger a pump alarm and prevent bolus insulin delivery. For more information, please see Chapter 10 of Section I of the OneTouch Ping Owner’s Booklet.
* Animas also suggests turning on the Vibrating Alert feature of the OneTouch Ping system, as described in Chapter 4 of Section I. This notifies the user that a bolus dose is being initiated by the meter remote, which gives the patient the option of canceling the bolus.
* The bolus delivery alert and the customizable limits on bolus insulin can only be enabled on the pump and cannot be altered by the meter remote. This is also true of basal insulin. Patients can also be reminded that any insulin delivery and the source of the delivery (pump or meter remote) are recorded in the pump history, so your patients can review the bolus dosing.

For additional information about the vulnerabilities or the compensating controls, users can contact the Animas Customer Technical Support at:

RA-ANMUS-CustomSupp@its.jnj.com or 1-877-937-7867.

NCCIC/ICS-CERT reminds users to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying compensating controls.

---

### Overview

The Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump contains multiple vulnerabilities that may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to obtain patient treatment or device data, or execute commands on the device. The attacker cannot obtain personally identifiable information.

### Description

| [**CWE-319**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)**: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information -** CVE-2016-5084  The Animas OneTouch insulin pump transmits patient treatment data and device data such as encryption passwords over the network in cleartext. An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to sniff all associated wireless transmissions from the device.According to Johnson and Johnson, parent company of Animas:*"**Information between the pump and meter is unencrypted, which could allow a malicious actor to capture patient treatment data, however this data does not include personally identifiable information."*[**CWE-330**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)**: Use of Insufficiently Random Values** - CVE-2016-5085The Animas OneTouch insulin pump uses a CRC32 checksum as if it were an encryption key. This value then does not change between authentication handshakes between the same device and remote station. According to Animas and Rapid7, "A malicious actor may be able to listen to communication between the pump and meter remote and obtain the necessary information to spoof being the meter remote."[**CWE-294**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay** - CVE-2016-5086The Animas OneTouch insulin pump uses a custom communication protocol that does not provide sufficient protections to guard against capture-replay attacks. According to Animas and Rapid7, "Once a malicious actor has spoofed being the meter remote, he/she could learn commands a patient initiate from the meter remote to the pump and attempt to replay them from a device other than the meter remote to the pump. Please refer to the mitigation section [see Resolution below] for details on controls in place to reduce this risk."[**CWE-290**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing** - CVE-2016-5686 The Animas OneTouch insulin pump uses a custom communications protocol that does not provide sufficient protections to guard against spoofed responses. Reportedly, it may be possible for an unauthenticated remote attacker to spoof acknowledgement packets to perform actions or commands on the device, or cause a remote to believe an acknowledgement was received after performing a command. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to sniff patient treatment or device data from communications, or execute commands on the device and/or remote, or prevent actions from occurring by spoofing acknowledgement packets. The attacker cannot obtain personally identifying information. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Johnson and Johnson has provided the following statement:*"There are no plans to release a firmware update, however a notification is being sent to patients and HealthCare Professionals. In addition, there are a number of documented and proprietary mitigating controls in place to ensure the safe delivery of insulin, outlined below.**i.\tIf patients are concerned about unauthorized access for any reason, the pump’s radio frequency feature can be turned off, which is explained in Chapter 2 of Section III of the OneTouch® Ping® Owner’s Booklet. However, turning off this feature means that the pump and meter will no longer communicate and blood glucose readings will need to be entered manually on the pump.**ii.\tIf patients choose to use the meter remote feature, another option for protection is to program the OneTouch® Ping® pump to limit the amount of bolus insulin that can be delivered. Bolus deliveries can be limited through a number of customizable settings (maximum bolus amount, 2-hour amount, and total daily dose).

Affected

### Vendor Statement

*"There are no plans to release a firmware update, however a notification is being sent to patients and HealthCare Professionals. In addition, there are a number of documented and proprietary mitigating controls in place to ensure the safe delivery of insulin, outlined below.*

*i.If patients are concerned about unauthorized access for any reason, the pump’s radio frequency feature can be turned off, which is explained in Chapter 2 of Section III of the OneTouch® Ping® Owner’s Booklet. However, turning off this feature means that the pump and meter will no longer communicate and blood glucose readings will need to be entered manually on the pump.*
*ii.If patients choose to use the meter remote feature, another option for protection is to program the OneTouch® Ping® pump to limit the amount of bolus insulin that can be delivered. Bolus deliveries can be limited through a number of customizable settings (maximum bolus amount, 2-hour amount, and total daily dose). Any attempt to exceed or override these settings will trigger a pump alarm and prevent bolus insulin delivery. For more information, please see Chapter 10 of Section I of the OneTouch® Ping® Owner’s Booklet.*
*iii.The company also suggests turning on the Vibrating Alert feature of the OneTouch® Ping® System, as described in Chapter 4 of Section I. This notifies the user that a bolus dose is being initiated by the meter remote, which gives the patient the option of canceling the bolus.*
*iv.The bolus delivery alert and the customizable limits on bolus insulin can only be enabled on the pump and cannot be altered by the meter remote. This is also true of basal insulin. Patients can also be reminded that any insulin delivery and the source of the delivery (pump or meter remote) are recorded in the pump history, so patients can review the bolus dosing."*
