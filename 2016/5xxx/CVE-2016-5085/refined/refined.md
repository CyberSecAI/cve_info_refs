Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump uses a weak pairing process between the remote and the pump.
*   During the pairing process, the devices exchange serial numbers and header information in cleartext.
*   A CRC32 checksum is generated from this information and used as a "key" for future communications. This "key" is also transmitted in cleartext.
*   This "key" is static between pairings, meaning it doesn't change for the same device pairing, making it predictable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Insufficiently Random Values (CWE-330):** The system uses a CRC32 checksum as a cryptographic key, which is not designed for this purpose and is easily predicted.
*   **Weak Pairing:** The pairing process relies on information transmitted in the clear, which allows an attacker to intercept the necessary information to impersonate the remote.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can sniff the communications, extract the "key", and spoof either the remote or the pump.
*   By spoofing the remote, the attacker can remotely issue commands to the pump, including unauthorized insulin injections.
*   This could lead to a hypoglycemic reaction in the patient.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Radio Frequency (RF) Communication:** The attack is carried out over the 900MHz band used by the device.
*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within a certain range of the device to intercept and transmit RF signals, this could be extended with more powerful equipment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within RF range of the pump and remote. While typical range is short, it can be extended by using stronger antennas and elevated locations.
*   **RF Sniffing and Spoofing:** The attacker needs the capability to sniff the 900MHz RF band, capture the pairing process information, and spoof transmissions between the pump and remote.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to extract the "key" and construct valid commands for the pump.

**Additional Details:**

*   The communication protocol lacks encryption.
*   The issue was reported by Rapid7.
*   The vendor, Animas, has been notified and is sending notifications to users.
*   The vendor will not be releasing a patch for this vulnerability.
*   Mitigation includes disabling the RF function, or setting limits on insulin doses, and enabling bolus alerts.
