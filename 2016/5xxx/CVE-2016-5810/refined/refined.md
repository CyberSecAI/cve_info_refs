Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-5810:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the `upAdminPg.asp` page of Advantech WebAccess. Specifically, it allows one authenticated project administrator to view the passwords of other project administrators, as well as the system administrator's password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** The primary vulnerability is that sensitive password information is accessible to unauthorized users (other administrators) via the `upAdminPg.asp` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with project administrator privileges can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to other administrator accounts, including the system administrator account, thereby escalating their privileges within the system.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The exposure of administrator passwords leads to a breach of confidentiality, potentially allowing an attacker to perform unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Although it is a web-based application, the attack can be performed over a network, as long as an attacker has access to the application with project administrator credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a project administrator, or an individual who has gained access to a project administrator's account, on the vulnerable Advantech WebAccess system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system running WebAccess.

**Additional Details from the ZDI advisory:**
