## [Out of bounds read and signed integer overflow in libarchive](/48-Out-of-bounds-read-and-signed-integer-overflow-in-libarchive.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Thursday, June 23. 2016

I recently wrote about a [large number of bugs and potential security issues in libarchive](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/47-Many-invalid-memory-access-issues-in-libarchive.html). The release 3.2.0 missed one fix for an out of bounds read in the rar parser. Also I discovered one additional signed integer overflow issue with ubsan. Both issues are now fixed in [libarchive 3.2.1](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/libarchive-discuss/sui01WaM3ic).

All issues were discovered with the help of american fuzzy lop.

[Out of bounds heap read in RAR parser](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/521)

[Sample rar file](http://libarchive.github.io/google-code/issue-413/comment-0/bsdtar-invalid-read.rar)

[CVE-2015-8934](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8934)

[Signed integer overflow in ISO parser](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/717#event-697151157)

[Sample ISO file](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/files/321672/libarchive-signed-int-overflow.zip)

[CVE-2016-5844](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5844)

Also a couple of [other security issues in libarchive were found by Cisco](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/06/the-poisoned-archives.html).

With the release of version 3.2.1 I consider libarchive to be reasonably robust against fuzzing. I've tested all supported file formats and fuzzed each one with afl/asan for at least one day. Of course that doesn't mean that no security issues are left - but the easy to find ones should be wiped out.

Issue 717: Fix integer overflow when computing location of volume des…

…criptor

The multiplication here defaulted to 'int' but calculations
of file positions should always use int64_t.  A simple cast
suffices to fix this since the base location is always 32 bits
for ISO, so multiplying by the sector size will never overflow
a 64-bit integer.

## Description

[![@hannob](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/990588?v=4&size=48)](/hannob)[hannob](https://github.com/hannob)opened [on Jun 18, 2016](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/717#issue-161015498)

The attached malformed iso file (packed as zip, because github limits attachment file types) will cause a signed integer overflow when passed to "bsdtar -tf [infile]" (tested with libarchive 3.2.0). This can be seen with undefined behavior sanitizer (compile with -fsanitize=undefined in CFLAGS/LDFLAGS).

ubsan error:

libarchive/archive\_read\_support\_format\_iso9660.c:1094:32: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 8388631 \* 2048 cannot be represented in type 'int'

This was found with the help of american fuzzy lop.

## Topic

An update for libarchive is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The libarchive programming library can create and read several different streaming archive formats, including GNU tar, cpio, and ISO 9660 CD-ROM images. Libarchive is used notably in the bsdtar utility, scripting language bindings such as python-libarchive, and several popular desktop file managers.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way libarchive handled hardlink archive entries of non-zero size. Combined with flaws in libarchive's file system sandboxing, this issue could cause an application using libarchive to overwrite arbitrary files with arbitrary data from the archive. (CVE-2016-5418)
* Multiple out-of-bounds write flaws were found in libarchive. Specially crafted ZIP, 7ZIP, or RAR files could cause a heap overflow, potentially allowing code execution in the context of the application using libarchive. (CVE-2016-1541, CVE-2016-4300, CVE-2016-4302)
* Multiple out-of-bounds read flaws were found in libarchive. Specially crafted LZA/LZH, AR, MTREE, ZIP, TAR, or RAR files could cause the application to read data out of bounds, potentially disclosing a small amount of application memory, or causing an application crash. (CVE-2015-8919, CVE-2015-8920, CVE-2015-8921, CVE-2015-8923, CVE-2015-8924, CVE-2015-8925, CVE-2015-8926, CVE-2015-8928, CVE-2015-8934)
* Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libarchive. Specially crafted RAR, CAB, or 7ZIP files could cause an application using libarchive to crash. (CVE-2015-8916, CVE-2015-8917, CVE-2015-8922)
* Multiple infinite loop / resource exhaustion flaws were found in libarchive. Specially crafted GZIP or ISO files could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of resources, eventually leading to a crash on memory exhaustion. (CVE-2016-7166, CVE-2015-8930)
* A denial of service vulnerability was found in libarchive. A specially crafted CPIO archive containing a symbolic link to a large target path could cause memory allocation to fail, causing an application using libarchive that attempted to view or extract such archive to crash. (CVE-2016-4809)
* An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in libarchive's construction of ISO9660 volumes. Attempting to create an ISO9660 volume with 2 GB or 4 GB file names could cause the application to attempt to allocate 20 GB of memory. If this were to succeed, it could lead to an out of bounds write on the heap and potential code execution. (CVE-2016-6250)
* Multiple instances of undefined behavior due to arithmetic overflow were found in libarchive. Specially crafted MTREE archives, Compress streams, or ISO9660 volumes could potentially cause the application to fail to read the archive, or to crash. (CVE-2015-8931, CVE-2015-8932, CVE-2016-5844)

Red Hat would like to thank Insomnia Security for reporting CVE-2016-5418.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1350280#c0)  Doran Moppert    2016-06-26 23:48:35 UTC  ``` Hanno Böck has disclosed another Undefined Behaviour (signed integer  overflow) on oss-security:      <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/591>  Upstream ticket:      <https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/717>  Upstream fix (released in libarchive-3.2.1):      <https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/commit/3ad08e0>  While the UB exists in 3.2.0, an earlier patch seems to mitigate against  the issue:      <https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/commit/e6c9668f>  This function is called immediately after the overflow, and will  immediately reject a negative skipsize with ARCHIVE_FATAL, skipping all  further processing.  Previous releases up to and including 3.1.2 (including 2.8.3, 2.8.4) do  not include the mitigation and are thus likely vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1350280#c1)  Doran Moppert    2016-07-05 04:38:39 UTC  ```  Created libarchive tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1352776](show_bug.cgi?id=1352776 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - libarchive: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1352775](show_bug.cgi?id=1352775 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-8920 CVE-2015-8921 CVE-2015-8932 CVE-2015-8933 CVE-2016-4809 CVE-2016-5844 CVE-2016-7166 libarchive: various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1350280#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-09-12 19:56:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2016:1850 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1850.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1350280#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-09-12 20:15:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:1844 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1844.html>   ``` |  |

Hanno Boeck and Marcin Noga discovered multiple vulnerabilities in
libarchive; processing malformed archives may result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.2-11+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive packages.

# libarchive: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-03**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libarchive, the worst
of which allows for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/libarchive** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.2** |

### Background

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1850)

## Topic

An update for libarchive is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The libarchive programming library can create and read several different streaming archive formats, including GNU tar, cpio and ISO 9660 CD-ROM images. Libarchive is used notably in the bsdtar utility, scripting language bindings such as python-libarchive, and several popular desktop file managers.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way libarchive handled hardlink archive entries of non-zero size. Combined with flaws in libarchive's file system sandboxing, this issue could cause an application using libarchive to overwrite arbitrary files with arbitrary data from the archive. (CVE-2016-5418)
* Multiple out-of-bounds read flaws were found in libarchive. Specially crafted AR or MTREE files could cause the application to read data out of bounds, potentially disclosing a small amount of application memory, or causing an application crash. (CVE-2015-8920, CVE-2015-8921)
* A denial of service vulnerability was found in libarchive's handling of GZIP streams. A crafted GZIP file could cause libarchive to allocate an excessive amount of memory, eventually leading to a crash. (CVE-2016-7166)
* A denial of service vulnerability was found in libarchive. A specially crafted CPIO archive containing a symbolic link to a large target path could cause memory allocation to fail, causing an application using libarchive that attempted to view or extract such archive to crash. (CVE-2016-4809)
* Multiple instances of undefined behavior due to arithmetic overflow were found in libarchive. Specially crafted Compress streams or ISO9660 volumes could potentially cause the application to fail to read the archive, or to crash. (CVE-2015-8932, CVE-2016-5844)

Red Hat would like to thank Insomnia Security for reporting CVE-2016-5418.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017
* 18 July 2017

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1362601#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2016-08-02 15:28:20 UTC  ``` Insomnia Security (as part of a pre-arranged commercial engagement) reports:  A vulnerability in libarchive exists that allows an archive Entry with type 1 (hardlink), but has a non-zero data size to cause a file overwrite. This vulnerability can be leveraged in a way that has a significant security impact (this was not clear at first during initial research by upstream).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1362601#c2)  Doran Moppert    2016-08-10 07:21:35 UTC  ``` Upstream bugs:  <https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/743> (umbrella report) <https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/744> <https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/745> <https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/746>  External reference:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/255>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1362601#c3)  Doran Moppert    2016-08-10 07:23:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1189473](attachment.cgi?id=1189473&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1189473&action=edit) patch for all issues against libarchive 3.1.2   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1362601#c4)  Doran Moppert    2016-08-10 07:27:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1189474](attachment.cgi?id=1189474&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1189474&action=edit) patch for all issues against libarchive 2.8.3  Patches against libarchive 3.1.2 (rhel-7) and libarchive 2.8.3 (rhel-6) attached.  Upstream have no timeline for fixing at this point.  The attached patches mitigate the issues on rhel-7/6 but may not be acceptable to upstream in their current form.  We are in contact with the upstream developer and sharing these patches with him, and will attempt to seek a compatible solution which makes rebasing easy against the next upstream release which addresses these flaws.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1362601#c7)  Doran Moppert    2016-08-12 01:10:06 UTC  ``` Hi Petr,  great to see the patch go into testing so fast.

## Description

[![@hannob](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/990588?v=4&size=48)](/hannob)[hannob](https://github.com/hannob)opened [on Jun 18, 2016](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/717#issue-161015498)

The attached malformed iso file (packed as zip, because github limits attachment file types) will cause a signed integer overflow when passed to "bsdtar -tf [infile]" (tested with libarchive 3.2.0). This can be seen with undefined behavior sanitizer (compile with -fsanitize=undefined in CFLAGS/LDFLAGS).

ubsan error:

libarchive/archive\_read\_support\_format\_iso9660.c:1094:32: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 8388631 \* 2048 cannot be represented in type 'int'

This was found with the help of american fuzzy lop.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory <http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin>

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

+ 18 October 2016
+ 17 January 2017
+ 18 April 2017
+ 18 July 2017

Subject: Out of bounds read and signed integer overflow in libarchive

<https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/48-Out-of-bounds-read-and-signed-integer-overflow-in-libarchive.html>

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/libarchive-discuss/sui01WaM3ic>
I recently wrote about a large number of bugs and potential security
issues in libarchive. The release 3.2.0 missed one fix for an out of
bounds read in the rar parser. Also I discovered one additional signed
integer overflow issue with ubsan. Both issues are now fixed in
libarchive 3.2.1. All issues were discovered with the help of american
fuzzy lop.

Also a couple of other security issues in libarchive were found by
Cisco.

With the release of version 3.2.1 I consider libarchive to be
reasonably robust against fuzzing. I've tested all supported file
formats and fuzzed each one with afl/asan for at least one day. Of
course that doesn't mean that no security issues are left - but the
easy to find ones should be wiped out.
