Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-5844:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A signed integer overflow occurs in the ISO9660 parser within libarchive when calculating the location of the volume descriptor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Signed Integer Overflow:** The multiplication of `LOGICAL_BLOCK_SIZE` and `vd->location` is performed using a default 'int' type, which is not large enough to store the result of certain inputs leading to a signed integer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Undefined Behavior/Potential Crash:** The integer overflow leads to undefined behavior. The overflowed value is used to calculate the amount of data to skip during file access and can cause incorrect reads/crashes.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The incorrect file location calculation due to overflow could cause an application using libarchive to consume an excessive amount of resources, potentially leading to a crash from memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious ISO Image:** A crafted, malformed ISO image containing a specific `vd->location` value triggers the integer overflow when parsed by libarchive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted ISO image to a vulnerable application using libarchive.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), a fuzzer.
*   The fix involves casting `vd->location` to `int64_t` before the multiplication to ensure that a 64 bit integer is used instead of the default 32 bit integer and avoiding the overflow
*   The vulnerability is present in libarchive versions prior to 3.2.1 and possibly earlier versions that do not include the fix made in version 3.2.1.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in libarchive version 3.2.1.
*   The vulnerability can be detected using the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSan) during compilation with appropriate flags.
