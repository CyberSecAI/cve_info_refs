- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Access Manager appliances use weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned other than network access. The complexity is described as high.
