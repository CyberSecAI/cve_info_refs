Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5027:

**CVE-2016-5027**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `_dwarf_decode_s_leb128` function within `libdwarf` when processing a corrupted DWARF section in an object file. Specifically, this happens within the function `_dwarf_decode_s_leb128` called from `dwarf_form.c:918` with a NULL pointer argument. This function is designed to decode a signed LEB128 value, but it does not handle the case where the input pointer `attr->ar_debug_ptr` is NULL. This can occur when the DWARF information is malformed, particularly when a `DW_FORM_sdata` entry is encountered with a NULL pointer.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. The function `_dwarf_decode_s_leb128` does not validate `attr->ar_debug_ptr` before attempting to access its value.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation leads to a crash (segmentation fault) of the application using the library, in this case `dwarfdump`. This could result in denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted object file with corrupted DWARF information. This file, when processed by `dwarfdump` using `libdwarf`, causes the vulnerable code path to be executed. The attacker can control the contents of the debug information in the object file.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an object file containing malformed DWARF debug information in a way that causes the `DW_FORM_sdata` case to be reached with a NULL pointer in `attr->ar_debug_ptr`. The attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by providing the crafted file to a user running dwarfdump.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Yue Liu.
*   The issue was present in `libdwarf-20160115` and the latest git code at the time of reporting.
*   The fix involves ensuring that  `_dwarf_decode_s_leb128` does not dereference a NULL pointer, which likely involves checking the validity of input `attr->ar_debug_ptr` before use.
*   The fix was included in `libdwarf-20160507-1.fc24`.
*   The bug report also includes a sample "bad elf" file that triggers the vulnerability.
