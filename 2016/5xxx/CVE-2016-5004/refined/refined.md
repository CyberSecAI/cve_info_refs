Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5004:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `ws-xmlrpc` library, specifically related to the handling of the `Content-Encoding` header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `ws-xmlrpc` library does not properly handle the `Content-Encoding` header, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. This implies that an attacker can cause the system using the vulnerable library to become unavailable or unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `Content-Encoding` header in XML-RPC requests processed by the `ws-xmlrpc` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted XML-RPC requests with a malicious `Content-Encoding` header to the target system. The attacker likely needs network access to the XML-RPC service.
