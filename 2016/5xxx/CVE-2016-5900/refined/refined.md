Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-5900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the failure to properly validate the TLS certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves the use of man-in-the-middle (MitM) techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the network traffic. This means they must be able to intercept communication between the vulnerable system and its intended destination.
- The attacker does not require any specific user privileges or credentials.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially obtain sensitive data by intercepting communications if TLS certificate validation is not properly implemented. This is achieved by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept network traffic and exploit the lack of proper TLS certificate validation, allowing the attacker to potentially eavesdrop on the communication and steal sensitive information.
