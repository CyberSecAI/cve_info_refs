# Security Bulletin: Multiple security issues in IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience on Cloud Network Capture Add-On

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on September 22 and 26, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience on Cloud Network Capture Add-On. IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience on Cloud Network Capture Add-On has addressed the applicable CVEs.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-2177](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177) **DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 5.9

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
