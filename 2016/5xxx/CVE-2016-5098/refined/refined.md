  "cveId": "CVE-2016-5098",
  "description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in libraries/error_report.lib.php in phpMyAdmin before 4.6.2-prerelease allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files by triggering an error.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient checks for supplied paths in the error reporting component, specifically how `PMA_countLines` function processes the file path provided.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Insufficient Path Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can determine the existence and size of arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the error reporting mechanism and observing the resulting error messages or the size of the file, which is disclosed in the error message.",
     "attackVectors": [
      "The attacker must intercept and modify the user's POST data.",
      "The attacker must be able to trigger a JavaScript error to the user."
      ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify POST data sent by a user of phpMyAdmin and trigger a Javascript error. This can be achieved through a Man-in-the-Middle attack, or by injecting malicious code."
