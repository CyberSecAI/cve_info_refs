{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The libarchive library improperly handles hardlink archive entries with non-zero data size, allowing overwriting of arbitrary files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of hardlink archive entries with data payloads in libarchive. Filesystem sandboxing issues in libarchive.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with arbitrary data, leading to command execution with the privileges of the process using libarchive or a denial-of-service by crashing the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted archive file containing hard links with data payloads is used to exploit the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to deliver and trick a user or application into processing a malicious archive file. No special privileges are required at first, but root access is achieved by overwriting arbitrary files."
