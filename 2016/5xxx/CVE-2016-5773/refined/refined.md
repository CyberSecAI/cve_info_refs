  "CVE_data": {
    "id": "CVE-2016-5773",
    "Description": "php_zip.c in the zip extension in PHP before 5.5.37, 5.6.x before 5.6.23, and 7.x before 7.0.8 improperly interacts with the unserialize implementation and garbage collection, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) via crafted serialized data containing a ZipArchive object.",
    "Root cause": "Improper interaction between the ZipArchive object, PHP's garbage collection (GC) algorithm, and the unserialize function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution or denial of service (application crash).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted serialized data containing a ZipArchive object",
      "PHP's unserialize function"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing crafted serialized data to a PHP application that utilizes the ZipArchive class and unserialize function."
