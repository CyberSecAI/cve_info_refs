{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of microtasks in Blink's JavaScript execution, specifically when executing Blink-in-JS callbacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the context of another domain, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive data, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious website that uses Blink-in-JS to execute JavaScript code, which leverages the improper microtask handling to gain unauthorized access to other domains' resources.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and have a victim visit that page with a vulnerable version of Chromium. The attacker needs to craft JavaScript code that leverages Blink-in-JS to trigger the vulnerability."
