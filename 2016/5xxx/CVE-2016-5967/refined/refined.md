Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WebSphere Application Server (WAS) administrator password appears in the Installation Manager (IM) native logs during the installation or update of Rational Asset Analyzer (RAA) when security is enabled.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the logging of sensitive information (WAS admin password) in plain text within IM logs. This is a logging of sensitive information issue.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with access to the IM logs could potentially obtain the WAS administrator password, leading to unauthorized access and control of the WebSphere Application Server and potentially the RAA application itself.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through access to the Installation Manager log files. This can happen if the log files are left exposed or if an attacker gains access to the server where the logs are stored.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs access to the Installation Manager log files on the affected system. This access could be achieved through various means, including but not limited to, compromised accounts, network access, or physical access to the server.
