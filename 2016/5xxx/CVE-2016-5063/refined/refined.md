    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Remote Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can obtain sensitive information about local users on the target system, including usernames and SIDs.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted XMLRPC request to the vulnerable agent over the network.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable BMC BladeLogic RSCD agent, typically listening on TCP port 4750 by default. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
