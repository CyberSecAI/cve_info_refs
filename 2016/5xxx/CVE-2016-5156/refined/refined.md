Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-5156:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the event bindings component of the Chromium browser, specifically in the `extensions/renderer/event_bindings.cc` file.
*   The code attempts to process filtered events even after failing to add an event matcher, leading to a use-after-free condition. This occurs because the code incorrectly continues to access memory associated with the event even when the event matcher is not properly set up.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use-after-free:**  The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, where memory associated with an event is accessed after it has been freed. This occurs because the event handling logic doesn't properly handle cases where an event matcher cannot be added.
*   **Improper resource handling:** The code does not properly check if the necessary resources (event matchers) are available before proceeding with event processing. This can lead to the invalid memory access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):** A remote attacker could trigger the use-after-free vulnerability leading to a crash of the browser.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution due to the heap corruption caused by the use-after-free
*  **Unspecified other impact:** While not explicitly detailed, the use-after-free could potentially lead to other unspecified impacts, such as leaking sensitive data, given the nature of this kind of vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a crafted website that triggers the specific code path in the event bindings that leads to the vulnerability.
*   **Web page with malicious content:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious webpage, with specific Javascript, that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to serve the malicious web page to a user running a vulnerable version of the Chromium browser.
*   No special privileges or authentication are required. The user simply needs to visit the malicious website.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involves ensuring that filtered events are not processed if an event matcher cannot be added.
*   The bug was fixed in Chrome version 53.0.2785.89 and 53.0.2785.92 for Linux.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2016-5156.

**Summary of Code Changes (from patch set 3):**

The patch in the `extensions/renderer/event_bindings.cc` file modifies the code path where a filtered event is processed. The patch ensures that an event is only dispatched if the `EventMatcher` has been successfully added. It adds a check that returns early to prevent the use-after-free if adding the event matcher fails.
Additionally, a `DCHECK` was added to verify that the event matcher value is not null.
