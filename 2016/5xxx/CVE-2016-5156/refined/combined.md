### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5159 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5159)

#### Description

Multiple integer overflows in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data that is mishandled during opj\_aligned\_malloc calls in dwt.c and t1.c.

# CVE-2016-5153

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5152.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5154.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5153 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5153)

#### Description

The Web Animations implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, improperly relies on list iteration, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-destruction) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web site.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[642598](https://crbug.com/642598)] CVE-2016-5167: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

Done. It seems safe to do this, but I wonder if I should add a CHECK to see if the previous filter value is equal to the one we get after adding the event matcher and getting it back.
