- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Accela Civic Platform Citizen Access portal uses client-side logic to validate file types during upload. This allows an attacker to bypass restrictions by manipulating the filename parameter in the submission request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434). The system relies on client-side validation, which is easily bypassed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can upload arbitrary files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the portal software.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack involves intercepting valid file upload requests and modifying the filename and \_EventArgument parameters to bypass file type restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated and have the ability to intercept and modify web requests.
