## Proxy auto-config (PAC) files have access to full HTTPS URLs

#### Vulnerability Note VU#877625

Original Release Date: 2016-08-04 | Last Revised: 2017-07-11

---

### Overview

Web proxy auto-config (PAC) files are passed the full HTTPS URL in GET requests which may expose sensitive data.

### Description

| [**CWE-212**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/212.html)**: Improper Cross-boundary Removal of Sensitive Data -** CVE-2016-5134 ([Google](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2016/07/stable-channel-update.html)), CVE-2016-1801 ([Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206568))  Web proxy auto-configuration files (proxy.pac) have access to the full URL including the path and parameters in HTTPS GET requests, which may expose sensitive data intended to be protected by HTTPS. This information is passed to the FindProxyForURL() function in the proxy.pac. The PAC file is often retrieved by the browser automatically using the WPAD protocol. An attacker in the position to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks may provide a malicious PAC file capable of exploiting the FindProxyForURL() function to exfiltrate sensitive data. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker who can provide a specially crafted PAC file can read URLs, including the path and query string, which may contain sensitive information intended to be protected by HTTPS. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update.**Apply the latest updates to your browser, see Vendor Information section below.Users who are unable to or do not wish to update their browsers should consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Disable WPAD.**If proxy auto-configuration is not necessary, consider disabling WPAD functionality for your browser. |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| This vendors listed below are suspected to be affected by the vulnerability. Other browser vendors not listed may be affected as well. The CERT/CC has no further evidence that any particular vendor is impacted unless marked Affected; vendors are encouraged to reach out to us to clarify their status. |

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[629852](https://crbug.com/629852)] CVE-2016-1705: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).

# CVE-2016-5135

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5134.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5136.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5135 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5135)

#### Description

WebKit/Source/core/html/parser/HTMLPreloadScanner.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82, does not consider referrer-policy information inside an HTML document during a preload request, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism via a crafted web site, as demonstrated by a "Content-Security-Policy: referrer origin-when-cross-origin" header that overrides a "<META name='referrer' content='no-referrer'>" element.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [oxide-qt](/security/cves?package=oxide-qt) - Web browser engine for Qt (QML plugin)

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1705](/security/CVE-2016-1705))

It was discovered that the PPAPI implementation does not validate the

origin of IPC messages to the plugin broker process. A remote attacker

could potentially exploit this to bypass sandbox protection mechanisms.

([CVE-2016-1706](/security/CVE-2016-1706))

It was discovered that Blink does not prevent window creation by a

deferred frame. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass

same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1710](/security/CVE-2016-1710))

It was discovered that Blink does not disable frame navigation during a

detach operation on a DocumentLoader object. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.

([CVE-2016-1711](/security/CVE-2016-1711))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5127](/security/CVE-2016-5127))

It was discovered that objects.cc in V8 does not prevent API interceptors

from modifying a store target without setting a property. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin

restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5128](/security/CVE-2016-5128))

A memory corruption was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5129](/security/CVE-2016-5129))

A security issue was discovered in Chromium. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL.

([CVE-2016-5130](/security/CVE-2016-5130))

A use-after-free was discovered in libxml. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5131](/security/CVE-2016-5131))

The Service Workers implementation in Chromium does not properly implement

the Secure Contexts specification during decisions about whether to

control a subframe. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5132](/security/CVE-2016-5132))

It was discovered that Chromium mishandles origin information during proxy

authentication. A machine-in-the-middle attacker could potentially exploit this

to spoof a proxy authentication login prompt. ([CVE-2016-5133](/security/CVE-2016-5133))

It was discovered that the Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature in Chromium

does not ensure that URL information is restricted to a scheme, host and

port. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2016-5134](/security/CVE-2016-5134))

It was discovered that Blink does not consider referrer-policy information

inside an HTML document during a preload request. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP)

protections. ([CVE-2016-5135](/security/CVE-2016-5135))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in

Blink does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this to determine whether a specific

HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report. ([CVE-2016-5137](/security/CVE-2016-5137))

[**More Reviews**](/search?repo_guid=c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee "Find reviews for the same repository ID - c14d891d44f0afff64e56ed7c9702df1d807b1ee") | DescriptionSanitize https:// URLs before sending them to PAC scripts.

A full functional test for proxy resolving is a pretty involved, and we don't really have an existing framework for that.  There are several more layers of goop around proxy resolving if we wanted to measure final delivery to a PAC script.    - MultiThreadedProxyResolver wrapping a platform implementation Or   - TracingProxyResolverV8 wrapping v8 proxy resolver Or   - Mojo proxy resolver wrapping either an in-process implementation or out-of-process forwarder.  Because we instantiate all these different modes (chrome side and embedder side) the biggest bang for your buck is testing the interface between ProxyService --> ProxyResolver.  You do have a valid point though. Minimally I will do some manual tests.  I would like a better story for end-to-end tests in the future.  <https://codereview.chromium.org/1996773002/diff/20001/net/proxy/proxy_service.cc> File net/proxy/proxy_service.cc (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/1996773002/diff/20001/net/proxy/proxy_service...](https://codereview.chromium.org/1996773002/diff/20001/net/proxy/proxy_service.cc#newcode364) net/proxy/proxy_service.cc:364: } On 2016/05/19 22:33:23, mmenke wrote: > An alternative approach would be to do: >  > if (policy == SanitizeUrlForPacScriptPolicy::SAFE &&  > url.SchemeIsCryptographic()) { >   return url.GetOrigin(); > } >  > GURL::Replacements replacements; > ... >  > Nice thing about that approach is it emphasizes this is indeed just an origin.  > Downside is it de-emphasizes just what the differences are between the two > paths.  I added a TODO to explore that, will follow-up.  There are some differences I would like to better understand between the two approaches -- GetOrigin() short circuits on non-standard URL schemes and completely clears the URL. I am not sure if that would come into play here, but would like to play it safe by using the existing pattern of code.

I hope to merge this CL to M52 so don't want to change the existing code organization too much.  I have ideas on improving this but will not be tackling them here.  (There are several refactoring opportunities around layering issues in this file -- too many PAC concepts leak into ProxyService.

I'd be fine with just a TracingProxyResolverV8 test that uses a PAC script that returns a different value based on whether the URL has any bonus bits attached, or similar.  I agree that it would be great if we had something more unity, too, but I think a full on integration test is good enough, for now.  > You do have a valid point though.

That said, I am not a fan of NET_EXPORT_PRIVATE for the reasons given in <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=552248>  (My pessimistic view is that its value erodes with time as consumers invariably depend on it, making it little more than a confusing out-of-date comment).

# CVE-2016-5137

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5136.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5138.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5137 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5137)

#### Description

The CSPSource::schemeMatches function in WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82, does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs and does not apply ws :80 policies to wss :443 URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine whether a specific HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report. NOTE: this vulnerability is associated with a specification change after CVE-2016-1617 resolution.
