Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Google Chrome's Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature handles URLs. It does not properly restrict the information passed to PAC scripts, leading to a potential URL leakage. Specifically, the full URL, including the path and parameters, is being passed instead of just the scheme, host, and port.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Data Handling:** The PAC feature incorrectly passes the complete URL to the PAC script, including potentially sensitive path and parameter information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposing the full URL to a PAC script allows an attacker to potentially intercept or log this data, leading to information leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially discover credentials embedded in URLs.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Query strings or path information in URLs could leak sensitive data that was intended to be protected by HTTPS.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker in a MitM position can intercept the request for the PAC file and provide a malicious one to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Server:** An attacker can operate a server that serves a malicious PAC script.
*   **WPAD Protocol:** The PAC file is often retrieved by the browser automatically using the WPAD protocol, which can be exploited by an attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Position:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept the request for the PAC file. This can include being on the same network as the victim or having control of a router or DNS server.
*   **Malicious Server:** The attacker must control a server from which they can serve a malicious PAC script.
*   **User Interaction:** User is required to visit a malicious website, or have their browser configured to use the attacker's malicious PAC script.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in `net/proxy/proxy_service.cc` in the Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82.
*   The fix involves restricting the URL information passed to PAC scripts to only include the scheme, host, and port, removing the path and parameters.
*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2016-3763.
*   Browsers that rely on the same PAC implementation are also affected such as Apple Safari (CVE-2016-1801).

The provided documents also indicate that the vulnerability was resolved in:
*   Chromium version 52.0.2743.82
*   Various SUSE products, openSUSE versions
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux
*   Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04
