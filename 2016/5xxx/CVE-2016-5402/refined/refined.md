Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5402:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a code injection flaw in the way Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine (CFME) processes imported control files within the Capacity and Utilization feature. Specifically, the application uses `eval` on a property from the `MiqEventDefinition` table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Code Injection:** The primary weakness is the use of `eval` on user-controllable data stored in the `MiqEventDefinition` table, allowing arbitrary code execution.
- **Insecure Deserialization (potential):** Although not explicitly stated, the use of `eval` on stored data is often a symptom of insecure deserialization vulnerabilities where attackers can craft malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the CFME server as the user the CFME service runs under, which could be root. This allows full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote, Authenticated Attack:** A remote attacker needs to be authenticated to the CFME application and have access to the Capacity and Utilization feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the CFME application.
- **Access to Capacity & Utilization Feature:** The attacker's user must have sufficient privileges to access and use the Capacity and Utilization functionality.
- **Ability to Modify MiqEventDefinition Table:** The attacker needs to be able to modify data within the `MiqEventDefinition` table, likely through the CFME interface or an associated API.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is present in CFME and ManageIQ.
- The specific vulnerable code is located at `app/models/bottleneck_event.rb#L75` in the manageiq repository.
- The fix involves sanitizing or avoiding the use of eval on user-provided data.
- The issue was addressed in RHSA-2016:2839.
- The security impact of this flaw is rated as "Important" by Red Hat.
- The fix is included in the Red Hat CloudForms 4.1 update (version 5.6.3).
