Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-5639

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in the `login.cgi` script of the Crestron AM-100's embedded web server. The `src` parameter, intended to specify a relative path to a file for rendering, allows path traversal. This means an attacker can manipulate the parameter to access files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The `src` parameter in the `login.cgi` script is vulnerable to path traversal. By using sequences like `../../`, an attacker can navigate the file system and access files outside the web server's document root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read any file on the AM-100 filesystem that the web server process has permission to access, including sensitive data like password hashes in `/etc/shadow`.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** By gaining access to system files, an attacker could potentially gather information needed to perform other attacks, like gaining root access through password cracking.
*   **Access to Network Credentials:** The device configuration files store connection details for the corporate wireless network which allows an attacker to potentially jump on the network with another device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `login.cgi` script on the AM-100 device.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the device's web interface, accessible via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the AM-100 device's web server. This could be from the same network segment or, if the device is exposed to the internet, from a remote location.
*   **No Authentication:** The attack does not require authentication, making it easier for a malicious actor to exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Crestron AM-100 firmware versions v1.1.1.11 to v1.2.1.
*   The web server runs as root, which means the attacker, once they achieve file read, is not restricted by file system permissions.
*   A hardcoded username/password combination also exists `rdtool::mistral5885` which when used to login allows uploading of arbitrary files to the device and also enables telnet on port 5885
*   The default root password is `awind5885`
*   The device stores session information in a file called session01 which contains cleartext passwords
*   The device configuration files store connection details for the corporate wireless network.

This information is more detailed than the original CVE description which simply states "A path traversal vulnerability exists in login.cgi (and possibly other binaries in the /home/boa/cgi-bin directory) on the AM-100 embedded web server. The src GET parameter passed to login.cgi specifies the relative path to a file for rendering, such as AwLoginDownload.html. However, the value of this parameter can specify an arbitrary path on the AM-100 filesystem".
