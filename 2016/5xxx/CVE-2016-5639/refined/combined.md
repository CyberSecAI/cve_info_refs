As a consultant, one of the perks of traveling to clients is seeing how different companies adopt next-generation devices in their office spaces. While most people currently think of the Internet of Things as something for hobbyists and geeks to spruce up their homes with, I have noticed a definite trend towards the adoption of these devices in the corporate world as well. Most forward-thinking companies I have been to in the last 6 months have at least one piece of internet connected automation, whether it’s a smart lock, digital camera sentry, or a Raspberry Pi that keeps track of beers on tap. While it definitely increases the “hip” factor, when these devices get connected to the network it brings in a whole new element of security concern.

One relatively common device I have been seeing in networks is some type of wireless presentation box. Instead of having to grab a cable to plug in, guests can conveniently connect over the air and project their screens. In theory, I love the idea because there’s nothing more annoying than having to keep three different types of cables around just in case someone has a different output port. In practice, they are an attacker’s new best friend because they are often unprotected, unpatched, and offer a clear route to jump from guest access to the employee network.

If you recognize this, you should probably keep reading

On a recent internal penetration test, I wanted to test the segmentation between a client’s guest wireless network and their corporate LAN. Everything seemed to be configured according to best practices, and the only thing I was able to locate were three wireless presentation devices, the [Crestron AM-100](https://www.crestron.com/products/model/am-100). Usually I will try to prioritize targets that have services that seem vulnerable first, such as Tomcat consoles, Wordpress blogs, or anonymous login FTP servers, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to poke around at these devices before I moved on.

As it turned out, these devices were completely full of holes. After a bit of Googling, three months ago the Cylance team publicly disclosed several critical vulnerabilities, including a [path traversal](https://github.com/CylanceVulnResearch/disclosures/blob/master/CLVA-2016-05-001.md), a [command injection](https://github.com/CylanceVulnResearch/disclosures/blob/master/CLVA-2016-05-002.md), and a hardcoded backdoor account. Thankfully, this was the perfect storm of issues that enabled us to get root on the device.

First, the /etc/shadow file was read:

![]()

However, even if we could crack it, there was no SSH or Telnet service on the device. Unless there’s a secret management console or something…

![]()

Using the username **rdtool** and the Google-able password ***mistral5885,*** I was able to turn on the Remote Debug service which caused a telnet server to open on port 5885!

![]()

Instead of waiting for the hash to actually crack out, I was able to read an [awesome presentation of someone who had already done the hard work](http://somethingbroken.com/vuln/static/0003_b.pdf) — the hardcoded root password was **awind5885.**

Now that I had root access on the device, it was possible to read the actual web console password in cleartext. Apparently the device stores valid session information in a file named **session01.**

![]()

The configuration files on the device also stored the connection details for the corporate wireless network, giving me a potential way to jump on with another device.

If that weren’t enough, the rdtool management page from before had the ability to upload files directly to the filesystem. If necessary, it would be trivial to create a malicious ELF binary with msfvenom and execute it from the terminal. Because the routing features of the ARM version of meterpreter ([mettle](https://github.com/rapid7/mettle)) were acting spotty for me and the fact that netcat was already readily available, I was able to [create a netcat relay](http://www.michaelboman.org/books/penetration-testing-notes/netcat) and forward my traffic into the target network.

One of the big problems I have with the Internet of Things is that devices are no longer just “things” but are actually potential footholds to the network. Yes, a simple HDMI cable seems so *passé* in 2016, but at least you don’t have to add it to your patch management program. As part of a strong security program, **all** these devices need to be inventoried and properly segmented from the rest of the network. In this particular case, updating the latest version of the firmware fixed most of these issues, but these devices almost always fly under the radar of even the most astute companies. The danger is very real — don’t be tempted to let convenience trump strong security practice.

## Crestron AirMedia AM-100 contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#603047

Original Release Date: 2016-08-01 | Last Revised: 2016-08-02

---

### Overview

The Crestron AirMedia AM-100 with firmware prior to version 1.4.0.13 is vulnerable to path traversal and command injection.

### Description

| [**CWE-22**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') -** CVE-2016-5639  A path traversal vulnerability exists in login.cgi (and possibly other binaries in the /home/boa/cgi-bin directory) on the AM-100 embedded web server. The src GET parameter passed to login.cgi specifies the relative path to a file for rendering, such as AwLoginDownload.html. However, the value of this parameter can specify an arbitrary path on the AM-100 filesystem.[**CWE-77**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') -** CVE-2016-5640A command injection vulnerability exists in rftest.cgi on the AM-100 embedded web server. The ATE\_COMMAND POST parameter specifies the path to a command for the underlying OS to execute. By default, the value of this parameter is /sbin/iwpriv; however, the value of this parameter can be a relative or absolute path to any arbitrary command on the underlying OS. Crestron AirMedia AM-100 firmware v1.1.1.11 - v1.2.1 are confirmed affected by the researcher. For more information see the researcher's [advisory one](https://github.com/CylanceVulnResearch/disclosures/blob/master/CLVA-2016-05-001.md) and [advisory two](https://github.com/CylanceVulnResearch/disclosures/blob/master/CLVA-2016-05-002.md). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote user may be able to access arbitrary files from the device filesystem, or execute arbitrary OS commands on the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Crestron has released [firmware version 1.4.0.13](http://www.crestron.com/products/model/AM-100) to address these issues. Affected users should update the firmware of their AM-100 as soon as possible. |

AirMedia can present Microsoft® Office documents (PowerPoint, Word, Excel), as well as PDFs and photos, from a smartphone or tablet device. Open the document in AirMedia and it is shared on the room display. Deliver dynamic and interactive presentations by simply paging through as you would any other application. There's no more being tied to a laptop or podium. You can even share your apps using the "Shot&Show" feature. Simply take a screen shot and AirMedia will show it.

**Multi-User Support**

Imagine 32 devices all connected and ready to share, but instead of a clutter of cables entangled across the tabletop or floor, there are just people and their Wi-Fi enabled devices. AirMedia lets up to 32 participants connect at once, switching from one to the next for seamless collaboration on the fly.

**Quad View**

Using Quad View mode, up to four sources can be displayed simultaneously, enabling participants to compare and contrast different content on screen at once without having to toggle back and forth.

**Moderator Mode**

For classrooms and other environments with many presenters, moderator mode (Layout Control) allows the instructor or meeting leader to easily control the presentation using the AirMedia Web page or a Crestron touch screen. With up to 32 participants connected, the moderator can continually control whose content is being displayed, and adjust where that content is positioned in the Quad View.

**Play, Pause, Stop**

Presenting with AirMedia is simple using intuitive Play, Pause, and Stop buttons that appear right on your device's screen. Clicking the Play button selects your device as the presentation source, sending whatever is on your screen to the room display. When done presenting, just click the Stop button to stop displaying your device.

While presenting, it is often necessary to navigate away from your presentation to find some other related content. AirMedia lets you pause the presentation, freezing the current image on screen so others can continue to view it while you look through your personal files and emails. Once you've located the new content and brought it up on your device, simply click Play to resume the presentation.

**Remote Viewing**

The onscreen presentation is only part of the AirMedia experience. Using Remote View mode, participants and spectators can view the presentation through their own Web browsers. Remote View displays the presentation as static images, which can be refreshed on demand or set to refresh automatically every few seconds. Remote viewers can even save images of the presentation to their personal device for later review.

**Connection Methods**

To accommodate a full range of presentation environments, users, and IT preferences, AirMedia offers several ways for a presenter to connect:

* **Installed Application —** This option installs a small software application directly onto each presentation computer. The installed application affords the highest performance and allows presenters to scan the local network for AirMedia gateways, connecting automatically if only one gateway is found, or displaying a list of gateways to choose from when multiple gateways are found. Alternately, a preset list of gateways can be deployed, eliminating the need to scan the network. Each gateway is clearly identified by its room name or some other friendly term. The Installed App method allows organizations to manage user rights, and includes the option to assign PIN codes to each individual gateway. Installation of the application can be deployed silently to personal computers across the enterprise, ensuring everyone in the organization is ready and able to connect to any approved AirMedia device with a single mouse click.
* **Web Browser —** Great for guest presenters, this option requires nothing to be pre-installed. Presenters simply follow the instructions displayed on the room display to point their Web browsers to the Web address of the local AirMedia gateway. A small utility runs on the presenter's computer, allowing the presentation to begin without hassle. As an option, the presenter may choose to download the utility software, allowing them to connect directly to that same gateway in the future without using the Web browser.
* **USB Thumb Drive —** As an alternative to using the Web browser method, the utility software may be loaded on a USB thumb drive providing a hardware dongle that simply plugs into the presenter's computer.

**Crestron Connected® Display Control**

Pairing AirMedia with a Crestron Connected projector or flat-panel display offers a seamless presentation solution. The AirMedia gateway communicates directly over the network with the display device, turning it on when a participant connects, and shutting it down after the last participant disconnects. Controls are also provided for turning the display on and off manually.[2]

*For more information about Crestron Connected products, please visit [www.crestron.com/products/crestron\_connected/](/products/crestron_connected/).*

**Easy Installation**

At just over an inch thick, the compact AirMedia gateway device fits easily above a projector or behind a flat panel display. A surface mounting bracket is included for attachment to a wall or ceiling, with HDMI® and VGA/analog audio outputs provided for connection to the display device. AirMedia connects to existing Ethernet infrastructure and takes advantage of your organization's Wi-Fi network, affording an optimal wireless interface for laptops and mobile devices.

**System Integration**

AirMedia isn't limited to small, single-display applications. It can be used with [DigitalMedia™](/digitalmedia), [CaptureLiveHD®](/capturelivehd), Crestron RL®, and other AV systems to provide a wireless option alongside DM®, HDMI, and other interfaces. AirMedia can be integrated and controlled as part of a complete Crestron control system using a touch screen, wireless remote, or mobile device.

**Network Management**

Managing multiple AirMedia gateways is enabled over the network using Crestron Fusion® Enterprise Management Software or SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). [Crestron Fusion](/fusion) provides a comprehensive integrated platform for creating truly smart buildings that save energy and enhance worker productivity. SNMP support allows integration with third-party IT management software, allowing network administrators to directly manage AirMedia gateways on the network in an IT-friendly format.

**Customizable Welcome Screen**

To facilitate a user-friendly experience, AirMedia provides a customizable home screen that appears on the room display to welcome meeting participants as they enter the room. The welcome screen can display the company logo and room name along with easy to follow instructions, enabling presenters to connect their devices and start presenting quickly for maximum productivity.

Description:
The Crestron AirMedia AM-100 with firmware versions v1.1.1.11 - v1.2.1 is vulnerable to multiple issues.

1) Path Traversal

GET request:
http://[AM-100-ADDRESS]/cgi-bin/login.cgi?lang=en&src=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow

2) Hidden Management Console

http://[AM-100-ADDRESS]/cgi-bin/login_rdtool.cgi
The AM-100 has a hardcoded default credential of rdtool::mistral5885
This interface contains the ability to upload arbitrary files (RD upload) and can enable a telnet server that runs on port 5885 (RD Debug mode).

3) Hardcoded credentials

The default root password for these devices is root::awind5885
Valid login sessions for the default (non-debugging) management interface are stored on the filesystem as session01, session02.. etc. Cleartext credentials can be read directly from these files.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [CLVA-2016-05-001]: Crestron AM-100 Path Traversal Vulnerability

# Summary

Cylance identified a vulnerability in the Crestron AirMedia AM-100, which could allow an unauthenticated entity to read arbitrary files on affected devices. The unauthenticated user must be able to access the web server on the affected devices.

## Product Description

The Crestron AirMedia AM-100 allows users to "wirelessly present PowerPoint®, Excel®, Word, and PDF documents, as well as photos, on the room display from their personal iOS® or Android™ mobile device" or desktop/laptop. (via <http://www.crestron.com/microsites/airmedia-mobile-wireless-hd-presentations>).

## Affected Products

* Crestron AirMedia AM-100 (firmware v1.1.1.11 - v1.2.1)

## Impact

An unauthenticated entity may be able to read arbitrary files on the affected AM-100 as superuser ("root").

# Vulnerability Information

* Cylance Identifier: CLVA-2016-05-001
* CVE Identifier: CVE-2016-5639

## Description

A path traversal vulnerability exists in `login.cgi` (and possibly other binaries in the `/home/boa/cgi-bin` directory) on the AM-100 embedded web server. The `src` GET parameter passed to `login.cgi` specifies the relative path to a file for rendering, such as `AwLoginDownload.html`. However, the value of this parameter can specify an arbitrary path on the AM-100 filesystem.

## Impact

The attacker may be able read the contents of unexpected files and expose sensitive data. Additionally, as the embedded web server runs as root, the attacker is unrestricted by filesystem permissions.

## Attack Scenario

An unauthenticated entity with access to the AM-100 embedded web server could, for example, read the system's password file, then conduct a brute force password guessing attack in order to break into an account on the system.

## Resolution

Crestron has released firmware version 1.4.0.13 to address this issue. Affected users should update the firmware of their AM-100 as soon as possible. Crestron partners can find the latest firmware at <http://www.crestron.com/products/model/AM-100>
