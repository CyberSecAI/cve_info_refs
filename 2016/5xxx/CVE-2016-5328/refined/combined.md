##### 1. Summary

VMware product updates address information disclosure issues in VMware Fusion and VMware Tools running on Mac OS X.

#####

##### 2. Relevant Products

* VMware Fusion
* VMware Tools

##### 3. Problem Description

**a. VMware Tools Information disclosure issue in Mac OS X Virtual  Machines**

An information disclosure vulnerability is present in VMware Tools running on Mac OS X VMs. Successful exploitation of this issue may allow a privileged local user on a system where System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled, to obtain kernel memory addresses to bypass the kASLR protection mechanism. SIP is default enabled in the latest versions of Mac OS X.

There are no known workarounds for this issue.

VMware would like to thank Marco Grassi (@marcograss) of KeenLab (@keen\_lab), Tencent for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5328 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is   available.
