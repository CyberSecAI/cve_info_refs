- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An information disclosure vulnerability exists in VMware Tools running on Mac OS X virtual machines.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of kernel memory addresses, potentially bypassing the kASLR protection mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow a privileged local user to obtain kernel memory addresses, which can then be used to bypass kASLR protection, potentially leading to further exploitation.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a privileged local user on a Mac OS X system where System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A privileged local user account on a Mac OS X system with SIP enabled is required to exploit this vulnerability.
