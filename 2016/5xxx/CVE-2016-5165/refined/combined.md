Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/08/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_31.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, August 31, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 53 to the stable channel - 53.0.2785.89 for Windows, Mac and 53.0.2785.92 for Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks **(Note:** **MSI still points to M52 and will be updated later).**

Chrome 53.0.2785.89 and 53.0.2785.92 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/52.0.2743.116..53.0.2785.92?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 53.
Security Fixes and Rewards

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[642598](https://crbug.com/642598)] CVE-2016-5167: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# CVE-2016-5166

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5165.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5167.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5166 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5166)

#### Description

The download implementation in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not properly restrict saving a file:// URL that is referenced by an http:// URL, which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to discover NetNTLM hashes and conduct SMB relay attacks via a crafted web page that is accessed with the "Save page as" menu choice.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5163 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5163)

#### Description

The bidirectional-text implementation in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not ensure left-to-right (LTR) rendering of URLs, which allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar via crafted right-to-left (RTL) Unicode text, related to omnibox/SuggestionView.java and omnibox/UrlBar.java in Chrome for Android.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c0)  Forgotten User EencPm1bev   2016-03-05 10:03:44 UTC  ``` This package: [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:datamaan:branches:home:datamaan/spotify-client](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home%3Adatamaan%3Abranches%3Ahome%3Adatamaan/spotify-client)  has the 32bit-builds failing with  RPMLINT report: =============== 0 packages and 0 specfiles checked; 0 errors, 2 warnings. Traceback (most recent call last):   File "rpmlint.py", line 385, in <module>   File "rpmlint.py", line 161, in main   File "rpmlint.py", line 220, in runChecks   File "AbstractCheck.py", line 52, in check   File "BinariesCheck.py", line 439, in check_binary   File "BinariesCheck.py", line 237, in __init__   File "Pkg.py", line 130, in getstatusoutput MemoryError   although I already have a _constraints file requiring 4GB of memory. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c1)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-03-05 20:20:15 UTC  ``` I thought, 32bit can only use 3 or 3.5GB - so maybe the 4GB is not really active  or there is some bug in rpmlint making it use excessive amounts of RAM.  I tried to reproduce it locally, but osc build --vm-type=kvm --clean openSUSE_13.2 i586 fails much earlier (probably cannot run 32bit KVM on 64bit host)? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c2)  Stefan Brüns   2016-03-06 15:12:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 667925](attachment.cgi?id=667925&action=diff "Lower memory use of objdump output") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=667925&action=edit "Lower memory use of objdump output") Lower memory use of objdump output ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c3)  Stefan Brüns   2016-03-06 15:13:16 UTC  ``` The problem is caused by rpmlints way to check for the pairing of chroot with chdir.  rpmlint uses "objdump -d" and reads the whole output into an internal string buffer. The output for the 100+ MByte libcef.so is ~1 GByte. This output is split into a list of strings, doubling the required size. For me, rpmlint needs about 2.9GByte of memory when checking the spotify package.  The problem can be mitigated by the attached change in rpmlint. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c4)  Luca Beltrame   2016-06-29 08:26:36 UTC  ``` This is affecting now also large packages like libqt5-qtwebkit, and it's preventing their inclusion in Factory. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c5)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-06-29 09:54:13 UTC  ``` I tested the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c2) and found that it is not only reversed, but also not working, because getstatusoutput defaults to shell=False and thus does not interpret the "|", but just passes it as a param to objdump.  But it would work with using such a small wrapper script:  #!/bin/sh export LC_ALL=C exec objdump -d "$1" | fgrep call  and then calling ('/path/to/objdumpgrepcall.sh', path)  quick test shows memory saving of factor 20 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c6)  Luca Beltrame   2016-06-29 10:28:31 UTC  ``` Hopefully it should be enough to fix libqt5-qtwebengine or similar packages. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c7)  Luca Beltrame   2016-06-29 13:47:18 UTC  ``` Raising priority as discussed with DimStar on IRC. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c8)  Stefan Brüns   2016-06-29 14:07:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Bernhard Wiedemann from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c5)) > I tested the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c2) > and found that it is not only reversed, but also not working, > because getstatusoutput defaults to shell=False > and thus does not interpret the "|", but just passes it as a param to > objdump. >  > But it would work with using such a small wrapper script: >  > #!/bin/sh > export LC_ALL=C > exec objdump -d "$1" | fgrep call >  > and then calling ('/path/to/objdumpgrepcall.sh', path) >  > quick test shows memory saving of factor 20  Somehow the wrong file ended up as a patch.

I am kindly requesting a back-port of this to openSUSE 13.2 maintenance to unblock the Chromium maintenance release on i586. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c14)  Andreas Stieger   2016-09-07 12:25:10 UTC  ``` Submitted myself: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/425260> Please handle the review when it comes. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c15)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-09-08 16:00:30 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (969732) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/425726> 13.1 / chromium+rpmlint+rpmlint-mini ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c16)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-09-13 11:09:26 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:2296-1: An update that fixes 20 vulnerabilities is now available.

# CVE-2016-5162

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-5161.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-5163.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5162 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5162)

#### Description

The AllowCrossRendererResourceLoad function in extensions/browser/url\_request\_util.cc in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not properly use an extension's manifest.json web\_accessible\_resources field for restrictions on IFRAME elements, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks, and trick users into changing extension settings, via a crafted web site, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-5160.
