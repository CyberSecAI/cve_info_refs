Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5841:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is an integer overflow in the `SyncExifProfile` function in `MagickCore/profile.c` of ImageMagick. Specifically, the `components` variable, read as a signed integer (`ssize_t`), is used to calculate `number_bytes`, which is of type `size_t`.  The multiplication `components * format_bytes[format]` can result in an integer overflow. This can then cause a heap-based buffer overflow. The problematic line is: `number_bytes=(size_t) components*format_bytes[format];`

Additionally, there is an out-of-bounds read in `MagickCore/property.c`. By manipulating the number of entries in a directory object of an image, the code can partially control the pointer `q`, leading to reads of arbitrary data. Specifically: `q=(unsigned char *) (directory+(12*entry)+2);` and subsequent reads via this pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Integer Overflow:** The `components` variable, being a signed integer, can become a very large negative number when read from the EXIF data. This large negative value when cast to `size_t` becomes a very large unsigned integer. The subsequent multiplication with `format_bytes[format]` can cause an integer overflow, leading to a small value for `number_bytes` due to the truncation/overflow, despite the fact that the allocated memory will be larger due to the large initial value. 
2.  **Heap-based Buffer Overflow**: This incorrect `number_bytes` value is later used to write to a buffer. Because `number_bytes` is smaller than expected, a write will occur at an address out of the expected buffer bounds.
3.  **Out-of-bounds Read:** In `MagickCore/property.c`, the code calculates a pointer `q` based on user-controlled data (`entry`). By manipulating the image data, an attacker can make `q` point outside of allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The integer overflow vulnerability in `MagickCore/profile.c` can lead to arbitrary writes to memory. By carefully crafting the input, an attacker can potentially achieve remote code execution by overwriting critical parts of memory, such as function pointers.
2.  **Information Leakage:** The out-of-bounds read vulnerability in `MagickCore/property.c` can leak sensitive data from the process's memory space. By controlling the read location, the attacker can obtain potentially sensitive information from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Image File:** An attacker can create a specially crafted image file (e.g. JPEG with a malicious EXIF profile) to trigger the vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick attempts to process this image.
2.  **Image Processing:** Any application that uses ImageMagick to process images is vulnerable. The vulnerabilities are triggered when the application calls the ImageMagick library and loads the malicious image data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker must be able to provide a malicious image file to ImageMagick either directly or through an application that uses ImageMagick.
2.  **Basic Understanding of EXIF:** A good understanding of the EXIF format allows to carefully craft the values used to compute `components` and `entry` to achieve the integer overflow, out-of-bounds read or arbitrary write, respectively.
