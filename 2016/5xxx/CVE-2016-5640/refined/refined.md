Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `rftest.cgi` script on the Crestron AirMedia AM-100's embedded web server.
*   The `ATE_COMMAND` POST parameter within this script is directly used to execute commands on the underlying operating system without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The application fails to neutralize special elements used in the `ATE_COMMAND` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.
*   The web server runs as root, so injected commands also run with root privileges.
*   The vulnerability is accessible through the web server, making it exploitable remotely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute any commands they want on the affected device.
*   **Full System Access:** Since the web server runs as root, successful exploitation grants the attacker unrestricted "root" level access to the system.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could read and modify sensitive data on the system for which they do not have permission to access directly.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers could potentially disable the software or disrupt device functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** Attackers send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `rftest.cgi` endpoint.
*   **`ATE_COMMAND` Parameter:**  The malicious command is included as the value of the `ATE_COMMAND` parameter within the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server running on the AM-100 device.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   The default value of the `ATE_COMMAND` parameter is `/sbin/iwpriv`, but an attacker can overwrite this with any relative or absolute path to any command on the OS.
*   The provided examples demonstrate how to trigger the vulnerability using a benign command (i.e., a valid iwpriv command) and a malicious command (i.e., whoami). The whoami command shows that the executed command runs as the root user.
*   The vulnerability affects Crestron AirMedia AM-100 devices with firmware versions between 1.1.1.11 and 1.2.1.
*   Crestron released firmware version 1.4.0.13 to fix this issue.
