| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c0)  Forgotten User EencPm1bev   2016-03-05 10:03:44 UTC  ``` This package: [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:datamaan:branches:home:datamaan/spotify-client](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home%3Adatamaan%3Abranches%3Ahome%3Adatamaan/spotify-client)  has the 32bit-builds failing with  RPMLINT report: =============== 0 packages and 0 specfiles checked; 0 errors, 2 warnings. Traceback (most recent call last):   File "rpmlint.py", line 385, in <module>   File "rpmlint.py", line 161, in main   File "rpmlint.py", line 220, in runChecks   File "AbstractCheck.py", line 52, in check   File "BinariesCheck.py", line 439, in check_binary   File "BinariesCheck.py", line 237, in __init__   File "Pkg.py", line 130, in getstatusoutput MemoryError   although I already have a _constraints file requiring 4GB of memory. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c1)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-03-05 20:20:15 UTC  ``` I thought, 32bit can only use 3 or 3.5GB - so maybe the 4GB is not really active  or there is some bug in rpmlint making it use excessive amounts of RAM.  I tried to reproduce it locally, but osc build --vm-type=kvm --clean openSUSE_13.2 i586 fails much earlier (probably cannot run 32bit KVM on 64bit host)? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c2)  Stefan Brüns   2016-03-06 15:12:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 667925](attachment.cgi?id=667925&action=diff "Lower memory use of objdump output") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=667925&action=edit "Lower memory use of objdump output") Lower memory use of objdump output ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c3)  Stefan Brüns   2016-03-06 15:13:16 UTC  ``` The problem is caused by rpmlints way to check for the pairing of chroot with chdir.  rpmlint uses "objdump -d" and reads the whole output into an internal string buffer. The output for the 100+ MByte libcef.so is ~1 GByte. This output is split into a list of strings, doubling the required size. For me, rpmlint needs about 2.9GByte of memory when checking the spotify package.  The problem can be mitigated by the attached change in rpmlint. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c4)  Luca Beltrame   2016-06-29 08:26:36 UTC  ``` This is affecting now also large packages like libqt5-qtwebkit, and it's preventing their inclusion in Factory. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c5)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-06-29 09:54:13 UTC  ``` I tested the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c2) and found that it is not only reversed, but also not working, because getstatusoutput defaults to shell=False and thus does not interpret the "|", but just passes it as a param to objdump.  But it would work with using such a small wrapper script:  #!/bin/sh export LC_ALL=C exec objdump -d "$1" | fgrep call  and then calling ('/path/to/objdumpgrepcall.sh', path)  quick test shows memory saving of factor 20 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c6)  Luca Beltrame   2016-06-29 10:28:31 UTC  ``` Hopefully it should be enough to fix libqt5-qtwebengine or similar packages. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c7)  Luca Beltrame   2016-06-29 13:47:18 UTC  ``` Raising priority as discussed with DimStar on IRC. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c8)  Stefan Brüns   2016-06-29 14:07:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Bernhard Wiedemann from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c5)) > I tested the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c2) > and found that it is not only reversed, but also not working, > because getstatusoutput defaults to shell=False > and thus does not interpret the "|", but just passes it as a param to > objdump. >  > But it would work with using such a small wrapper script: >  > #!/bin/sh > export LC_ALL=C > exec objdump -d "$1" | fgrep call >  > and then calling ('/path/to/objdumpgrepcall.sh', path) >  > quick test shows memory saving of factor 20  Somehow the wrong file ended up as a patch. See <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint/issues/67> for a working patch. The patch also fixes <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint/issues/66> ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c9)  Stefan Brüns   2016-08-07 15:22:31 UTC  ``` This should be fixed in Factory:  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/415832> ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c10)  Andreas Stieger   2016-09-03 17:32:22 UTC  ``` We'd need a back-port of this rpmlint fix openSUSE:13.2:Update, where Chromium fails on 32 bits (for [bug 996648](show_bug.cgi?id=996648 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: chromium: multiple vulnerabilities fixed in 53.0.2785.89"))  Can you submit this? ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c11)  Andreas Stieger   2016-09-06 19:54:06 UTC  ``` ping for a 13.2 backport? ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c12)  Stefan Brüns   2016-09-06 20:55:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andreas Stieger from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c11)) > ping for a 13.2 backport?  So whom are you asking? ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c13)  Andreas Stieger   2016-09-07 08:01:47 UTC  ``` The package maintainer. I am kindly requesting a back-port of this to openSUSE 13.2 maintenance to unblock the Chromium maintenance release on i586. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c14)  Andreas Stieger   2016-09-07 12:25:10 UTC  ``` Submitted myself: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/425260> Please handle the review when it comes. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c15)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-09-08 16:00:30 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (969732) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/425726> 13.1 / chromium+rpmlint+rpmlint-mini ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=969732#c16)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-09-13 11:09:26 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:2296-1: An update that fixes 20 vulnerabilities is now available.

The download implementation in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not properly restrict saving a file:// URL that is referenced by an http:// URL, which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to discover NetNTLM hashes and conduct SMB relay attacks via a crafted web page that is accessed with the "Save page as" menu choice.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[642598](https://crbug.com/642598)] CVE-2016-5167: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/).  The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

## Issue [2075273002](/2075273002/): Resource requests from Save-Page-As should go through CanRequestURL checks. (Closed)

This CL: - Added checks to ResourceDispatcherHostImpl::BeginSaveFile to verify if the renderer process is authorized to access a given resource. - Removed separate code path for file: URIs that used to be implemented in SaveFileManager::SaveLocalFile. Avoiding a separate code path helps consolidate all authorization checks in one place.

I am not quite sure if this CL is ready to land, but I think it is ready for discussion about the overall direction + about the remaining open issues:  - open issue #1: using correct child_id (frame with the given resource, rather than always the main frame - these can differ with OOPIFs present)  - open issue #2: is it ok to rewrite a link to inaccessible resources as something like <img src="./foo_files/resource-failed-to-save-<guid>.txt">  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2075273002/diff/1/chrome/test/data/save_page/...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2075273002/diff/1/chrome/test/data/save_page/unauthorized-access.htm) File chrome/test/data/save_page/unauthorized-access.htm (right):  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2075273002/diff/1/chrome/test/data/save_page/...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2075273002/diff/1/chrome/test/data/save_page/unauthorized-access.htm#newcode16) chrome/test/data/save_page/unauthorized-access.htm:16: </html> In theory I could reuse b.htm here, but a separate test file seems cleaner, more readable (i.e. allows for comments like I have above).

I need to double-check how process_id/child_id and render_view_routing_id and render_frame_routing_id are used by ResourceDispatcherHostImpl.  Maybe I should just pass the right thing here (with appropriate tracking via an extra map in SavePackage)?  OTOH, this would make it harder to merge the fix to beta/stable branches...   FWIW, I don't think this is a ship blocker for --isolate-extensions, but please double-check my thought process.  AFAICT, we will get the following behavior, if we always pass main frame's ID (instead of the ID of the frame this resource originated from):  case #1: main frame authorized, subframe unauthorized: security bug, BUT this would only impact the case when saving a page where the main frame comes from an extension (I am not sure if this is possible;  so far I couldn't trigger Save-Page dialog for background pages).  case #2: main frame unauthorized, subframe authorized: not a security bug;  impact is that some legitimate resources are not saved.  This should not be an issue because AFAIK we don't consider save-page-as feature as a blocker for --isolate-extensions.  [https://codereview.chromium.org/2075273002/diff/1/content/browser/download/sa...](https://codereview.chromium.org/2075273002/diff/1/content/browser/download/save_package.cc#newcode1001) content/browser/download/save_package.cc:1001: "resource-failed-to-save-" + base::GenerateGUID() + ".txt")); This is tricky.  We could analyze this with an example of a website that embeds a resource (i.e. an <img> tag) with file: URI, but it will be easier to understand with an example of an *internet* website that links to a resources on the *intranet*.  Currently we forbid websites from linking to resources on the local filesystem, but in the future we plan to forbid internet websites from linking to intranet websites (<https://crbug.com/590714>).  Let's say that Eve creates an internet webpage with a tag saying: <img src="http://bob-s-intranet/send-all-money-to-eve.jpg">.  Now, I claim that: 1. The browser should not access the intranet link when *showing* the internet website 2. The browser should not access the intranet link when *saving* the internet website 3. The browser should not access the intranet link when *showing* the *saved* contents of the internet website  To prevent item 3 above, we should not save the intranet link when serializing the "complete html" of the internet webpage being saved.  I've decided to instead serialize a link to a non-existent file (non-existency guarantess by uniqueness of the guid).  I am not sure if I am happy with this solution, but I can't think of a better alternative.  I recognize that the code above can negatively impact legitimate/non-malicious scenarios.  For example previously, the saved page could be opened and would renderer all resources even if some resources were inaccessible during the save process (e.g. because of network flakiness, not because of authorization issues).  Hmmm... maybe we should differentiate between unauthorized and other error codes?  OTOH, this would seem fragile (i.e. would require exhaustively enumerating all future error codes related to unauthorized access OR all future error codes related to authorized access).  WDYT?

BUG=616429 ==========  to  ========== Resource requests from Save-Page-As should go through CanRequestURL checks.  This CL:  - Added checks to ResourceDispatcherHostImpl::BeginSaveFile to verify if   the renderer process is authorized to access a given resource.  - Removed separate code path for file: URIs that used to be implemented   in SaveFileManager::SaveLocalFile.  Avoiding a separate code path   helps consolidate all authorization checks in one place.  - When serializing HTML, we no longer emit the original URI for   resources that failed to save to disk.  Instead we write a path to a   non-existant local file.  This ensures that a malicious website cannot   trigger access to an unauthorized resource at a later time (when the   saved page is opened).  It is recognized that this behavior change also   impacts non-malicious scenarios (i.e. when a resource failed to save   because of a network issue).

This should not be an issue because AFAIK we don't consider save-page-as feature as a blocker for --isolate-extensions.  Thanks for calling this out. In addition to the two cases listed above, we can also be in a situation where the parent and the child frames are using different request contexts via storage partitions. In this case invoking 'Save as' would leak PII by mixing requests from different cookie stores. We do consider this to be a problem.  In practice, this only applies to apps that use <webview> elements. I don't know what would happen if one were to attempt to invoke 'save as..' on an app document. Invoking "Save as" inside the webview (if it's even possible), should correctly use the inner WebContents. This is certainly something worth testing.  <https://codereview.chromium.org/1924473003> is the CL where I added StorageParition safety to regular downloads. You might be able to add something like the test changes made there for chrome/browser/apps/guest_view/web_view_browsertest.cc .

As long as we are talking about subresources, I'm okay with treating all failed subresources the same way as ones that were not found.  #2 should guarantee that the process of saving doesn't persist a mix of resources from intranet/internet (unless the source document is in the intranet?).

I think I have the right attribution in patchset 2.  Initially, I was a bit concerned that process_id and/or routing_ids would be used in unexpected ways and that correct attribution might break it.  It turns out that they *are* used in creative ways (e.g. in SaveFileManager::GetSavePackageFromRenderIds), but AFAICT everything should continue to work despite my changes.

Yes - propagating origin-specific restrictions into the saved file is really tricky (given that [an untrusted] renderer controls the html contents being serialized + given that today we don't have code that recognizes that a local html file was saved from a web origin).  It would probably be best to treat it as a separate issue (with MotW / mark-of-the-web being the proposed propagation mechanism).  Note that I've also tried to share some related observations in <https://crbug.com/616429#c13> and <https://crbug.com/616429#c14>.  FWIW, I've reverted changes related to protecting against "unauthorized" access from the already saved page (so for subresources that failed to save we will serialize html links pointing at the original [i.e. web] uri [rather than pointing to resource-failed-to-save-<guid>.txt as I proposed in the initial patchset]).  > Note that mixing internet/intranet appears to be a common mechanism when dealing > with IOT stuff like IP connected cameras. >  Ack.

It seems that not saving resources from ftp URIs is an explicit engineering decision from the past.  Not saving data: URIs should not be an issue.

You're right.  Mea culpa.

Maybe.  I cannot think of a better name.  The gist here is that SAVE_FILE_FROM_NET save items are saved via a new resource request (which can come from the net, but we hope it will come from in-memory cache).  Some name ideas that I don't like:  - SAVE_FILE_VIA_RESOURCE_REQUEST - it misses "FROM", so seems like a bad name for a SaveFile*Source* enum.  - SAVE_FILE_FROM_RESOURCE_REQUEST - this seems confusing / I am not sure what it means to save something "from" a resource request  I think that SAVE_FILE_FROM_NET is okay, even with the changes (because resource requests are a concept from the //net layer).

Note that we have a VLOG for other similar messages: - in ShouldServiceRequest (line 304) - in BeginRequest (line 1460)  OTOH, we have a DVLOG here: - in BeginDownload (line 718)  So my change makes it 50-50 :-P.

Thanks for raising this up.  I thought that it might be okay to depend on the type, because SaveFileResourceHandler is created right above on line 1886.  I am not sure what "calling OnResponseCompleted in a reasonable handler agnostic way" means :-(  In particular, there is no documentation of |defer| parameter and I am not sure if it is appropriate to duplicate what other callers of OnResponseCompleted do (|if (!defer) ResumeIfDeferred();|) since there is nothing save-page-related to resume and resuming non-save-page-related things seems out of place here.

The method is inherited from content::ResourceHandler, so that's where they're documented.

Yea....Unfortunately for you, I wasn't an owner when that was signed off on, and I don't think we need any more instances of that that's going to be hanging around for 5 more years.  Code should be able to assume APIs are consumed correctly.  There are a few options, as I see it:  1)  Create a ResourceLoader as normal and cancel it (Need to make sure the URLRequest never starts). 2)  Never create a URLRequest, just cancel the request directly.  AbortRequestBeforeItStarts does this, and if that works for you, let's use it.  However, I assume SaveFileResourceHandler has some sort of UI hooks to tell the user something went wrong?

I have little confidence in the latest changes I am making in resource_dispatcher_host_impl.cc (to be honest I had higher confidence in correctness of the previous, simple code - otoh, I see that tight coupling with SaveFileResourceHandler's implementation might be undesirable for long-term maintenance, despite presence of regression tests that exercise that path).  FWIW, I've verified that in the latest patchset (using ResourceLoader::CancelRequest + ResourceDispatcherHostImpl::StartLoading) I do get a call to SaveFileResourceHandler::OnResponseCompleted with false==status.is_success() when running SavePageBrowserTest.SaveUnauthorizedResource that is being added in the current CL.

Err... okay.  Not sure which ResourceController I can / should use here.

This is slightly tricky wrt management of the lifetime of the ResourceLoader.  If I destroy ResourceLoader upon return from BeginSaveFile, then the ResponseCompleted task posted by ResourceLoader::CancelRequestInternal will never run (because of weak ptr usage).  OTOH, I am not sure where I should stash the std::unique_ptr<ResourceLoader> - pending_loaders_? blocked_loaders_? just call StartLoading (not sure how that impacts your comment to "make sure the URLRequest never starts")?  > (Need to make sure the URLRequest never starts).  I am not sure what that means :-(.  I am not calling BeginRequestInternal in this code path, but for managing lifetime of ResourceLoader I ended up calling StartLoading.  OTOH, I checked that in this case ResourceLoader::StartRequestInternal exits early, because |!request_->status().is_success()| - AFAICT the success is set by URLRequest::DoCancel.  > 2)  Never create a URLRequest, just cancel the request directly.  > AbortRequestBeforeItStarts does this, and if that works for you, let's use it.  I couldn't figure out how to do this.  - Inside BeginSaveFile ResourceDispatcherHostImpl::filter_ is null (and I don't know what other instance of ResourceMessageFilter I could pass to AbortRequestBeforeItStarts).  - I am not sure how request ids work.  I see that BeginSaveFile decrements request_id_ which makes me wary of using this field (maybe save-file-related requests don't need a request_id?  there is no renderer involved fwiw).  > However, I assume SaveFileResourceHandler has some sort of UI hooks to tell the > user something went wrong?  SaveFileResourceHandler::OnResponseCompleted will propagate the status of the resource request through SaveFileManager::SaveFinished (FILE thread) and SavePackage::SaveFinished(...is_success...) (UI thread).  OTOH note that failure to save a subresource of a page doesn't cause failure of the whole save-page - we just won't rewrite links to this subresource (e.g. we won't rewrite img.src to point at ./foo_files/subresource.png).  > Maybe a magic > InformWhateverAPIWe'reTalkingToOfFailure method, that combines what starting + > failing the request does?  I think that won't be needed based on the error-propagation-explanation I gave above. ```     | **mmenke** | | On 2016/07/22 18:10:45, Łukasz Anforowicz wrote: > mmenke@, could you please take another look?

No knowing what ResourceController is just the point - we aren't in any way using the ResourceHandler API, so we should either use it in a normal way, through a ResourceLoader, or never instantiate a ResourceHandler, but rather do the same work through another path.  > > > FWIW, in the latest patchset I've tried to duplicate what another piece of > > code > > > is doing at > > > > > > [https://cs-staging.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/loader/resource_...](https://cs-staging.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/loader/resource_dispatcher_host_impl.cc?rcl=1469114341&l=2320) > > > (including darin's TODO... :-o). > >  > > Yea....Unfortunately for you, I wasn't an owner when that was signed off on, > and > > I don't think we need any more instances of that that's going to be hanging > > around for 5 more years.

We're blocking a request for security reasons.  It must never go over the network.

Ahh...It looks like these requests don't come straight from the renderer, and don't get a renderer-assigned request ID, so cancellation has to go through another path.  > > However, I assume SaveFileResourceHandler has some sort of UI hooks to tell > the > > user something went wrong? >  > SaveFileResourceHandler::OnResponseCompleted will propagate the status of the > resource request through SaveFileManager::SaveFinished (FILE thread) and > SavePackage::SaveFinished(...is_success...)

Hrm...  Creating a loader, cancelling the loader, and then calling "StartLoading" seems problematic to me as well.  It looks like ResourceLoader::StartRequestInternal() checks if the request was cancelled (Before being started), so things may magically work, but...  It seems like all we need to do is:  BrowserThread::PostTask(     BrowserThread::FILE, FROM_HERE,     base::Bind(&SaveFileManager::SaveFinished, save_manager, save_item_id,                save_package_id, false));  Instead of creating the SaveFileResourceHandler, though we may not want to introduce that level of dependency on the SaveFileManager to the RDH.  Could we just tell the SaveFileResourceHandler to fail the request, and have that make SaveFileResourceHandler::OnWillStart return false?  Open to other ideas.  Just don't want to introduce a dependency on a weird path through the ResourceLoader or the SaveFileResourceHandler.  I've learned that depending on non-standard paths through state machines is just asking for trouble. ```     | **Łukasz Anforowicz** | | On 2016/07/22 18:35:23, mmenke wrote: > On 2016/07/22 18:10:45, Łukasz Anforowicz wrote: > > mmenke@, ... | | --- | | 4 years, 5 months ago (2016-07-22 19:31:47 UTC) [#20](#msg20) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/07/22 18:35:23, mmenke wrote: > On 2016/07/22 18:10:45, Łukasz Anforowicz wrote: > > mmenke@, could you please take another look?

Thanks for reemphasizing this point - this is after all the whole point behind this CL.  OTOH, I don't see how to add such verification to the new SavePageBrowserTest.SaveUnauthorizedResource test - any suggestions?  In particular, I am not sure how to monitor "file:" URI requests (e.g. embedded_test_server()->RegisterRequestMonitor would only intercept http requests AFAIK.  > > > 2)  Never create a URLRequest, just cancel the request directly.  > > > AbortRequestBeforeItStarts does this, and if that works for you, let's use > it. > >  > > I couldn't figure out how to do this. > >  > > - Inside BeginSaveFile ResourceDispatcherHostImpl::filter_ is null (and I > don't > > know what other instance of ResourceMessageFilter I could pass to > > AbortRequestBeforeItStarts). > > > > - I am not sure how request ids work.

There is a little bit of indirection (in that we don't return early in BeginSaveFile, but go through with regular request processing and rely on SaveFileResourceHandler cancelling in OnWillStart) but I guess this is okay.

You're right about the indirection, but I can't think of an approach I like better.  If SaveFileManager had a NotifyComplete/Failed/Whatever method that worked from the IO thread, I'd say just call that, but having to do the post task to the file thread from RDH seems uglier to me than this approach (Also, the SaveFileManager is currently exclusively used on the FILE and UI threads, so adding a random method that can be called on any thread doesn't seem a great addition to its API). ```     | **Randy Smith (Not in Mondays)** | | On 2016/07/22 19:49:10, mmenke wrote: > On 2016/07/22 19:31:47, Łukasz Anforowicz wrote: > > On ... | | --- | | 4 years, 5 months ago (2016-07-23 14:10:56 UTC) [#22](#msg22) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/07/22 19:49:10, mmenke wrote: > On 2016/07/22 19:31:47, Łukasz Anforowicz wrote: > > On 2016/07/22 18:35:23, mmenke wrote: > > > On 2016/07/22 18:10:45, Łukasz Anforowicz wrote: > > > > I am not sure what that means :-(.

Just to be explicit: I'm disappearing for a week, so leaving this to Matt.  I'll leave myself on as reviewer in case it takes more than a week (this is the kind of thing I should solidly understand as a content/browser/loader OWNER) but I'm not blocking so that shouldn't get in the way.  This is obvious from the conversation but: Don't land without Matt's stamp (I don't see a way to retract my stamp without blocking the CL, but Matt's right to want us to find a different way to do this). ```     | **mmenke** | | Sorry for the delay.

Yes, only used in one place, but I'm paranoid.  I don't know, that doesn't feel right.

Good point.  I've added comments in both places.  When writing the comments about having to call MarkAsUnauthorized before starting the request, I thought it would be good to add a DCHECK for this.  I think DCHECK(!is_pending()) does a good job here (I've checked that it will get hit if [for test purposes] calling MarkAsUnauthorized after RDHI::BeginRequestInternal). ```     | **mmenke** | | On 2016/07/27 18:48:02, Łukasz Anforowicz wrote: > On 2016/07/27 14:45:19, mmenke wrote: > > Sorry ... | | --- | | 4 years, 4 months ago (2016-07-27 18:54:18 UTC) [#25](#msg25) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/07/27 18:48:02, Łukasz Anforowicz wrote: > On 2016/07/27 14:45:19, mmenke wrote: > > Sorry for the delay. >  > No worries.

Not going to fight over this, but I'm not sure what "begins its life as authorized" means - we could trivially check if it's authorized before we create it.

This is much nicer because setting the authorization state via the constructor totally avoids the problem of calling MarkAsUnauthorized after the request has already started.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-5163 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5163)

#### Description

The bidirectional-text implementation in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not ensure left-to-right (LTR) rendering of URLs, which allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar via crafted right-to-left (RTL) Unicode text, related to omnibox/SuggestionView.java and omnibox/UrlBar.java in Chrome for Android.
