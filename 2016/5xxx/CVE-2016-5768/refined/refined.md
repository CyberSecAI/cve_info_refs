Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-5768:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability in the `_php_mb_regex_ereg_replace_exec` function within the mbstring extension of PHP. Specifically, this occurs during the processing of a regular expression when using the `mb_ereg_replace_callback` function, where a callback exception leads to a double free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Double Free:** The vulnerability stems from a double free condition that can be triggered when a callback function used in `mb_ereg_replace_callback` throws an exception. The `description` pointer is freed at line 985 due to the exception, and is freed again on line 1012, leading to a double free.
- **Integer Overflow** - though not the root cause, integer overflow can trigger a memory allocation error which can be later exploited via the double free condition

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The double-free vulnerability can lead to an application crash due to heap corruption.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (potentially):** In specific circumstances and with carefully crafted PHP code, this vulnerability could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution via double-free and use-after-free exploitation techniques (though this is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided contexts, it is implied).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attackers:** The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers, as indicated in the provided descriptions. This is specifically stated in the SUSE information: "allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact...".
- **Crafted HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious pattern used in `mb_ereg_replace_callback`, which causes the application to execute an improperly defined or failing callback.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to craft an HTTP request:** The attacker needs to be capable of sending HTTP requests containing crafted input to a vulnerable PHP application.
- **Ability to trigger the vulnerable code:** The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable PHP code to be executed. This could potentially be done by sending a carefully crafted HTTP request to a publicly accessible PHP page.

**Additional details:**

- **Versions Affected:** The vulnerability affects PHP versions before 5.5.37, 5.6.x before 5.6.23, and 7.x before 7.0.8, as per the official CVE description.
- **Mitigation:** The provided information suggests that updating PHP to the corrected versions will resolve this vulnerability.
- **Open Source Nature:** The content from lists.opensuse.org mentions "openSUSE-SU-2016:1922-1: moderate: Security update for php5" which indicates that this is an open-source software and that this vulnerability is patched in updated packages of php5.
- **SUSE Information:** The SUSE information included notes the issue's moderate severity, and that the state of this security issue is "Resolved". Additionally it provides information about affected products, CVSS scores, and SUSE Security Advisories.
- **Red Hat Information:** Red Hat also released errata for this issue, which indicates a fix for this vulnerability in php5 versions. They rated the issue as "moderate".

**Summary of extracted information:**

The vulnerability is an integer overflow leading to a double free condition in the mbstring extension when using `mb_ereg_replace_callback` in PHP.  This can be triggered by an attacker sending specially crafted input via HTTP, which is then processed by the vulnerable function, causing a potential denial of service (application crash) and, under certain circumstances, possibly code execution. The fixes involve updating to PHP versions after 5.5.37, 5.6.23, and 7.0.8 to include the patched code which prevents this vulnerability.
