The content is related to CVE-2016-5645.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An undocumented and privileged Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community string exists in MicroLogix 1400 programmable logic controllers (PLC).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Undocumented SNMP community string with elevated privileges.
- The affected devices use SNMP for firmware updates, which is the official method for applying such updates.
- The SNMP service is enabled by default.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could make unauthorized changes to the productâ€™s configuration, including firmware updates.
- This could lead to disruption or manipulation of industrial processes controlled by the PLC.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation is possible, leveraging the network capabilities of the SNMP protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs network access to the affected device.
- Low skill level is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
