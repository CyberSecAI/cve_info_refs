  "CVE-2016-5271": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds read during the processing of text runs in some pages using `display:contents`.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect handling of frame continuations when using `display: contents`. Specifically, the `GetInsertionPrevSibling` function in `nsCSSFrameConstructor.cpp` incorrectly uses the first-in-flow frame instead of the correct continuation frame for child insertions. This leads to text frames sharing the same text run and subsequent out-of-bounds reads in `IsCSSWordSpacingSpace` and `IsTrimmableSpace` when accessing character data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A crash due to an out-of-bounds read. Although the immediate impact of this read is limited and may not lead to arbitrary code execution, the underlying issue of incorrect frame handling could potentially expose other more severe vulnerabilities. It's noted that this might indicate a deeper problem where text runs might not be updated to reflect changes in the underlying DOM text.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by rendering a page with specific CSS properties (`display: contents`) and DOM manipulations (e.g., adding child elements using `outerHTML`)."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to control the HTML content of a page to trigger the vulnerability. No specific user interaction or local privileges are needed.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Core::Layout: Text and Fonts"
