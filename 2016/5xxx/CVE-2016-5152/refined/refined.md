  "CVE-2016-5152": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in the opj_tcd_get_decoded_tile_size function in tcd.c in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `opj_tcd_get_decoded_tile_size` function within the OpenJPEG library, specifically in the tcd.c file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to the integer overflow."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger a denial of service (DoS) by exploiting the heap-based buffer overflow and can possibly achieve arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By processing a crafted JPEG 2000 image."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted JPEG 2000 image. No specific privileges or authentication are required. The attacker needs to have a way of making the vulnerable software process the crafted image."
