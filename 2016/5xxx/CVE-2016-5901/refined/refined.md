Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A test page within IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) was found to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS). Specifically, panels in the Process Admin Console were not properly protected against XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the IBM BPM's web UI, specifically in the Process Admin Console. This allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- This malicious code can alter the intended functionality of the application.
- Exploitation could potentially lead to the disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web UI of the IBM BPM application.
- An attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable field or parameter within the Process Admin Console.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a user interacting with the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker requires the ability to interact with the web UI, typically requiring at least a low-privileged user account.
-  The attacker needs to craft a malicious JavaScript payload.
- The attack relies on a victim (a user of the BPM) interacting with the crafted content to execute the malicious script.
