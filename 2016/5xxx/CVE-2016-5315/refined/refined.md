Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2016-5315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An illegal read access violation occurs within the `setByteArray` function located in `tif_dir.c` of the libtiff library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The `setByteArray` function attempts to read data from memory locations that are outside the allocated buffer or valid memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The read access violation leads to a crash, terminating the application. This results in a DoS condition, making the application unavailable.
- Potential for other undefined behavior: Out-of-bounds reads can have unpredictable consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted TIFF image: An attacker creates a specially crafted TIFF image file.
- User interaction: The attacker needs to entice a user or application to process/open the crafted TIFF image using a vulnerable version of libtiff.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and deliver a malicious TIFF image file to a target system.
- The attacker does not need to be local and can leverage remote vectors like emails, or websites.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found by Kaixiang Zhang of the Cloud Security Team, Qihoo 360.
- The issue was discovered in `libtiff` version 4.0.6 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is triggered when using the `rgb2ycbcr` tool, while processing the crafted tiff file.
- The stack trace provided in the Openwall content, shows the crash occurs during memory allocation within `setByteArray` function, leading to a crash.
- The Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201701-16) confirms this issue as a DoS vulnerability that can be exploited remotely and notes that it's one of many vulnerabilities found in `libtiff`.

**Summary:**
CVE-2016-5315 in `libtiff` involves a crafted TIFF image that triggers an out-of-bounds read in the `setByteArray` function, resulting in a crash and DoS condition. An attacker needs to deliver the malformed TIFF to a vulnerable user or application.
