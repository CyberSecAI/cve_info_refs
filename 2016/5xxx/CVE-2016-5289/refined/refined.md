  - Some of the specific bugs are:
        - `Adding too many SimulcastStreams leads to stack smashing` (Bug 1314667)
        - `Invalid array access in MediaEngineCameraVideoSource::GetCapability()` (Bug 1298107)
        - `Out-of-bounds write to unboxed object in arm64 backend` (Bug 1277866)
        - `Crash in InvalidArrayIndex_CRASH | nsTArray_Impl<T>::operator[] | mozilla::TrackBuffersManager::GetSample` (Bug 1305876)
        - `libjpeg-turbo: index out of bounds in [@initial_setup]` (Bug 1301252)
        - `Crash in InvalidArrayIndex_CRASH | mozilla::EventListenerManager::GetListenerInfo` (Bug 1300129)
        - `"Assertion failure: uint32_t(LittleEndian::readUint64(point) >> 32) < SCTAG_TRANSFER_MAP_HEADER" with DOM MessageChannel` (Bug 1252511)
        -  `Crash [@ JSScript::code] or Crash [@ js::jit::ICEntry::pc] with use-after-free` (Bug 1296649)

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - The advisory explicitly states that these bugs showed "evidence of memory corruption."
   - It is presumed that with enough effort, some of these vulnerabilities could be exploited to run "arbitrary code." This means successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The specific attack vectors are not detailed for each individual bug within CVE-2016-5289. However, they involve processing of various types of data, including:
        - SVG content
        - WebRTC streams
        - JavaScript objects
        - DOM events
        - Image data

   - These data handling vulnerabilities could be triggered by a malicious website or crafted content.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   -  An attacker would need the ability to:
        -  Craft malicious web content or data that could trigger the memory corruption bugs within the browser's handling of various data types
        -  Lure a user into visiting the malicious web content
        -  Exploit the memory corruption to gain arbitrary code execution capabilities.
    
**Summary of extracted information:**
CVE-2016-5289 is a collection of memory safety vulnerabilities in Firefox 49, fixed in Firefox 50. The vulnerabilities include various types of memory corruption issues like use-after-free, heap-buffer-overflow, and out-of-bounds read/write, triggered by malicious data. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. The attack vector is through specially crafted content, likely via malicious websites.
