  "CVE-2016-5116": {
    "Description": "gd_xbm.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka libgd) before 2.2.0, as used in certain custom PHP 5.5.x configurations, allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer under-read and application crash) via a long name.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer under-read in gd_xbm.c in the GD Graphics Library, specifically within the gdCtxPrintf function. The issue occurs when a long name is passed to this function, which then uses vsnprintf to format a string into a local buffer. If the formatted string exceeds the buffer's size, vsnprintf truncates the output, but the function doesn't check the return value to detect this truncation, leading to an out-of-bounds read when the truncated length is returned. This causes a memory leak where the data from the memory above the stack is disclosed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer under-read",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Improper handling of return values",
      "Information disclosure",
       "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) or obtain sensitive information from process memory due to stack-based buffer under-read. The crafted XBM image causes the application to crash, while the memory leak can reveal potentially sensitive data stored in the memory. Depending on how libgd is used, arbitrary code execution might be possible.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted XBM image file with a long name, triggering a buffer under-read when libgd processes this image. This can be done by a remote attacker if the vulnerable function is exposed via a network service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted image file to a vulnerable system. No special privileges are needed, and the vulnerability can be triggered remotely."
