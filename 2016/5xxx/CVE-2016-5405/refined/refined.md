{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the usage of `strcmp` and `memcmp` in the verification of passwords and hashes within the 389 Directory Server. These functions have variable execution time depending on the input, which can be exploited to reveal information about the password.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can potentially retrieve the directory server password after many attempts by analyzing the timing differences in password verification. Systems storing passwords in plain text are directly vulnerable, while systems using unsalted hashes may also be vulnerable if using weak hash algorithms, although the attack would be very time-consuming.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Remote network attack"
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send LDAP requests to the server and measure the response time accurately. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability"
