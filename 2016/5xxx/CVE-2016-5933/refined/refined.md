- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Firewall (Proxy) Gateway being susceptible to a host header injection attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper validation or sanitization of the Host header by the Firewall Gateway. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the header.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to HTTP cache poisoning and/or firewall bypass. HTTP cache poisoning could allow an attacker to serve malicious content to other users, while firewall bypass could allow an attacker to bypass security measures.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious data into the Host header of an HTTP request. This is a network-based attack, and the attacker would likely need to be able to send requests to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IBM Tivoli Monitoring Firewall Gateway. The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R). An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can exploit the vulnerability. The system is vulnerable over the network (AV:N).
