The provided content includes information about CVE-2016-5001, which is an information disclosure vulnerability in Apache Hadoop.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is in the short-circuit reads feature of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
A local user on an HDFS DataNode can craft a block token by guessing certain fields within it. This crafted token can grant the user unauthorized read access to arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local user can gain unauthorized read access to files within the HDFS.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local access to an HDFS DataNode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be a local user on an HDFS DataNode and needs to be able to craft a block token by guessing certain fields.

The vulnerability affects Apache Hadoop versions 2.7.1, 2.6.3, and earlier. Users are advised to upgrade to versions 2.7.2 or later for the 2.7.x branch and 2.6.4 or later for the 2.6.x and earlier branches.
