  "CVE-2016-5290": {
    "description": "Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Christian Holler, Ehsan Akhgari, Jon Coppeard, Gary Kwong, Tooru Fujisawa, Philipp, and Randell Jesup reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird ESR 45.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerability": "Multiple memory safety bugs",
    "impact": "Potential arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vector": "Exploitation through malformed web content processing.",
     "required_capabilities": "Requires user to open a malicious web page with Thunderbird.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in Thunderbird ESR 45.4 and has been fixed in version 45.5. The advisory mentions that scripting is disabled when reading mail in Thunderbird, however it may still be a risk in browser or browser-like contexts."
