- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper privilege management in GE Proficy HMI/SCADA CIMPLICITY allows an authenticated user to modify the service configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application allows modification of the CIMPLICITY service configuration, potentially enabling the launch of arbitrary executables with service privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify the configuration of the CIMPLICITY service and execute arbitrary code on the system with service privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local, requiring an authenticated user to run the vulnerable application and load a specially crafted file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to authenticate to the vulnerable application. They also need to trick the user into opening a malicious file.
