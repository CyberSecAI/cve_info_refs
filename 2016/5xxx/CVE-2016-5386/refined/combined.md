## CGI web servers assign Proxy header values from client requests to internal HTTP\_PROXY environment variables

#### Vulnerability Note VU#797896

Original Release Date: 2016-07-18 | Last Revised: 2016-07-19

---

### Overview

Web servers running in a CGI or CGI-like context may assign client request Proxy header values to internal HTTP\_PROXY environment variables. This vulnerability can be leveraged to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on internal subrequests or to direct the server to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts.

### Description

| [**CWE-807**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/807.html)**: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision,** [**CWE-454**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/454.html)**: External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores**  Web servers running in a CGI or CGI-like context may assign client request Proxy header values to internal HTTP\_PROXY environment variables. The vulnerable behavior is the result of a naming convention for meta-variables, defined in [RFC 3876](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875), which leads to a name collision: "The HTTP header field name is converted to upper case, has all occurrences of "-" replaced with "\_" and has "HTTP\_" prepended to give the meta-variable name."According to the researchers, a web server is vulnerable if:   1. *A web server, programming language or framework (and in some limited situations the application itself) sets the environmental variable HTTP\_PROXY from the user supplied Proxy header in the web request, or sets a similarly used variable (essentially when the request header turns from harmless data into a potentially harmful environmental variable).* 2. *A web application makes use of HTTP\_PROXY or similar variable unsafely (e.g. fails to check the request type) resulting in an attacker controlled proxy being used (essentially when HTTP\_PROXY is actually used unsafely).*  By sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable server, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to conduct MITM attacks on internal server subrequests or direct the server to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts. For more information, refer to [httpoxy.org](https://httpoxy.org/). |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to conduct MITM attacks on internal server subrequests or direct the server to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Where applicable, affected products and components should be updated to address this vulnerability. Check with vendors for information about patching.Where patches are unavailable or updating is not an option, consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Filter** **Proxy** **request headers**The researchers and community have identified several filtering strategies that are product-dependent:**Apache/CGI**In this configuration, any language may be vulnerable (the HTTP\_PROXY env var is "real"). If you are using mod\_headers , you can unset the "Proxy" header with this directive:       RequestHeader unset Proxy If you are using mod\_security, you can use a rule like (vary the action to taste):      SecRuleEngine On    SecRule &REQUEST\_HEADERS:Proxy "@gt 0"    "id:1000005,log,deny,msg:'httpoxy denied'" Refer to [Apache's response](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt) for more information.**HAProxy**      httprequest delheader Proxy **lighttpd <= 1.4.40 (reject requests containing "Proxy" header)**Create "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua", read-only to lighttpd, with content:      if (lighty.request["Proxy"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end Modify lighttpd.conf to load mod\_magnet and run lua code      server.modules += ( "mod\_magnet" )    magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua" ) **lighttpd2 (development) (strip "Proxy" header from request)**Add to lighttpd.conf:      req\_header.remove "Proxy"; **Nginx/FastCGI**Use this to block the Proxy header from being passed on to PHPFPM, PHPPM, etc.      fastcgi\_param HTTP\_PROXY ; **Nginx with proxy\_pass**The following setting should work for people who are using "proxy\_pass" with nginx:      proxy\_set\_header Proxy ; Microsoft has provided the following guidance for IIS servers utilizing affected third-party frameworks:**Microsoft IIS Mitigation steps:**Update apphost.config with the following rule:  <system.webServer>    <rewrite>        <rules>            <rule name=3D"Erase HTTP\_PROXY" patternSyntax=3D"Wildcard">                <match url=3D"\*.\*" />                <serverVariables>                    <set name=3D"HTTP\_PROXY" value=3D />                </serverVariables>                <action type=3D"None" />            </rule>        </rules>    </rewrite></system.webServer> |

### [Apache HTTP Server Project](#BLUU-ABSLHW) Affected

Notified:  July 12, 2016  Updated: July 18, 2016

**Statement Date:   July 14, 2016**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The Apache Software Foundation has discovered no examples of condition 2 described in the [redacted] report, and has determined there is no "vulnerability" per se in ASF software, which conform to both RFC822 (circa 1982) and CGI/1.1 defacto standard (circa 1995, superseded by CGI/1.1 IANA spec RFC 3875).

Several ASF projects participate in HTTP requests in the manners described under condition 1. The list of projects that will offer one or more mitigations include but are not limited to;

Apache HTTP Server (httpd) (Tracked as CVE-2016-5387)
Apache Tomcat Server (Tracked as CVE-2016-5388)
Apache Traffic Server (ATS) (Tracking is not applicable)

Projects and subprojects impacted by the Apache HTTP Server mitigations will include mod\_fcgid (Apache HTTP Project) and mod\_perl (Apache Perl Project), as well as external projects such as mod\_wsgi, all hopefully under CVE-2016-5387.

Note specifically that any CVE related to mod\_fcgi[d] must be ignored, as it duplicates CVE-2016-5387. We have not reached a conclusion on separate tracking that might be unique to mod\_perl itself (thus far, it also appears to duplicate -5387.)

### [lighttpd](#JLAD-ABZJ3A) Affected

Updated:  July 19, 2016

**Statement Date:   July 19, 2016**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Mitigation of httpoxy is available in lighttpd.

Mitigation:

lighttpd <= 1.4.40 (reject requests containing "Proxy" header)

\* Create "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua", read-only to lighttpd, with content:
if (lighty.request["Proxy"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end

\* Modify lighttpd.conf to load mod\_magnet and run lua code
server.modules += ( "mod\_magnet" )
magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua" )

lighttpd2 (development) (strip "Proxy" header from request)
\* Add to lighttpd.conf: req\_header.remove "Proxy";

Reference:

\* lighttpd 1.4 repo contains fix on git master branch to strip "Proxy" header and the commit message below contains the above mitigation steps for lighttpd 1.4.x <https://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/repository/revisions/779c133c16f9af168b004dce7a2a64f16c1cb3a4>

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory <http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin>

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

+ 18 October 2016
+ 17 January 2017
+ 18 April 2017
+ 18 July 2017

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 310 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [July 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2282980.1).

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use  [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html) .

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible** . Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2017 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2261562.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2261562.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 32 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 28 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## A CGI application vulnerability (in 2016) for PHP, Go, Python and others

*httpoxy* is a set of vulnerabilities that affect application code running in CGI, or CGI-like environments. It comes
down to a simple namespace conflict:

* RFC 3875 (CGI) puts the HTTP `Proxy` header from a request into the environment variables as `HTTP_PROXY`
* `HTTP_PROXY` is a popular environment variable used to configure an outgoing proxy

This leads to a remotely exploitable vulnerability. If youâre running PHP or CGI, you should block the `Proxy` header.
[Hereâs how.](#fix-now)

httpoxy is a vulnerability for server-side web applications. If youâre not deploying code, you donât need to worry.

#### What can happen if my web application is vulnerable?

If a vulnerable HTTP client makes an outgoing HTTP connection, while running in a server-side CGI application, an
attacker may be able to:

* Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application
* Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing
* Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy

httpoxy is extremely easy to exploit in basic form. And we expect security
researchers to be able to scan for it quickly. Luckily, if you read on and
find you are affected, [easy mitigations](#fix-now) are available.

## Isnât this old news? Is this still a problem?

httpoxy **was disclosed in mid-2016**. If youâre reading about it now for the first time, you can *probably* relax and
take your time reading about this quaint historical bug that *hopefully* no longer affects any of the applications you
maintain. But you should verify that to your own satisfaction.

The content below this point reflects the original disclosure, and Iâll be leaving the site up and mostly unchanged, other
than noting fix versions where I can. I guess Iâm just saying: the time for urgency was last year.

## What Is Affected

A few things are necessary to be vulnerable:

* Code running under a CGI-like context, where `HTTP_PROXY` becomes a real or emulated environment variable
* An HTTP client that trusts `HTTP_PROXY`, and configures it as the proxy
* That client, used within a request handler, making an HTTP (as opposed to HTTPS) request

For example, the confirmed cases weâve found so far:

| Language | Environment | HTTP client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHP | php-fpm  mod\_php | Guzzle 4+  Artax |
| Python | wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler  twisted.web.twcgi.CGIScript | requests |
| Go | net/http/cgi | net/http |

But obviously there may be languages we havenât considered yet. CGI is a common standard, and
`HTTP_PROXY` seems to be becoming more popular over time. Take the below as a sample of the most
commonly affected scenarios:

### PHP

* Whether you are vulnerable depends on your specific application code and PHP libraries, but the problem
  seems fairly widespread
* Just *using* one of the vulnerable libraries, while processing a userâs request, is exploitable.
* If youâre using a vulnerable library, this vulnerability will affect any version of PHP
  + It even affects alternative PHP runtimes such as HHVM deployed under FastCGI
* It is present in Guzzle, Artax, and probably many, many libraries
  + Guzzle versions in the range `>=4.0.0rc2,<6.2.1` are vulnerable, Guzzle 3 and below is not.
  + Another example is (update: was) in Composerâs StreamContextBuilder utility class

So, for example, if you are using a Drupal module that uses Guzzle `6.2.0` and makes an outgoing HTTP request (for example,
to check a weather API), you are vulnerable to the request that plugin makes being âhttpoxiedâ.

### Python

* Python code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, thatâll mean the vulnerable code
  will use a CGI handler like `wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler`
  + This is not considered a normal way of deploying Python webapps (most people are using WSGI or FastCGI, both of which are
    not affected), so vulnerable Python applications will probably be much rarer than vulnerable PHP applications.
  + wsgi, for example, is not vulnerable, because os.environ is not polluted by CGI data
* Vulnerable versions of the requests library will trust and use `os.environ['HTTP_PROXY']`, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in `2.7.13`, `3.4.6`, `3.5.3`, `3.6.0` (see [the Python advisory](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/cve-2016-1000110_httpoxy_attack.html))

### Go

* Go code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, thatâll mean the vulnerable code uses
  the `net/http/cgi` package.
  + As with Python, this is not considered a usual way of deploying Go as a web application, so this vulnerability should be
    relatively rare
  + Goâs `net/http/fcgi` package, by comparison, does not set actual environment variables, so it is *not* vulnerable
* Vulnerable versions of `net/http` will trust and use `HTTP_PROXY` for outgoing requests, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in Go `1.7rc3`, all stable versions of `>=1.7`

## Immediate Mitigation

The best immediate mitigation is to block `Proxy` request headers as early as possible, and before they hit your
application. This is easy and safe.

* Itâs safe because the `Proxy` header is undefined by the IETF, and isnât listed on the
  [IANAâs registry of message headers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml). This means
  **there is no standard use for the header at all**; not even a provisional use-case.
* Standards-compliant HTTP clients and servers will never read or send this header.
* You can either strip the header or completely block requests attempting to use it.
* You should try to do your mitigation as *early* and as far *upstream* as you can.
  + Do it âat the edgeâ, where HTTP requests first enter your system.
  + That way, you can fix lots of vulnerable software at once.
  + Everything behind a reverse proxy or application firewall that strips the `Proxy` header is safe!

How you block a `Proxy` header depends on the specifics of your setup. The earliest convenient place to block the header
might be at a web application firewall device, or directly on the webserver running Apache or NGINX. Here are a few of
the more common mitigations:

### NGINX/FastCGI

Use this to block the header from being passed on to PHP-FPM, PHP-PM etc.

```
fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";

```

In FastCGI configurations, PHP is vulnerable (but many other languages that use NGINX FastCGI are not).

For specific NGINX coverage, we recommend that you read the official [NGINX blog post](https://www.nginx.com/blog/mitigating-the-httpoxy-vulnerability-with-nginx)
on this vulnerability. The blog post provides a graphic depiction of how
httpoxy works and more extensive mitigation information for NGINX.

### Apache

For specific Apache coverage (and details for other Apache software projects like Tomcat), we strongly recommend
you read the [Apache Software Foundationâs official advisory](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt) on
the matter. The very basic mitigation information youâll find below is covered in much greater depth there.

If youâre using Apache HTTP Server with `mod_cgi`, languages like Go and Python may be vulnerable (the `HTTP_PROXY` env var
is ârealâ). And `mod_php` is affected due to the nature of PHP. If you are using **mod\_headers**, you can unset the
`Proxy` header before further processing with this directive:

```
RequestHeader unset Proxy early

```

Example for using this in `.htaccess` files:

```
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
   RequestHeader unset Proxy
</IfModule>

```

If you are using **mod\_security**, you can use a `SecRule` to deny traffic with a `Proxy` header. Hereâs an example,
vary the action to taste, and make sure `SecRuleEngine` is on. The 1000005 ID has been assigned to this issue.

```
SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Proxy "@gt 0" "id:1000005,log,deny,msg:'httpoxy denied'"

```

Finally, if youâre using Apache Traffic Server, itâs not itself affected, but you can use it to strip the `Proxy` header; very helpful
for any services sitting behind it. Again, see the [ASFâs guidance](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt),
but one possible configuration is:

* Within `plugin.config`, inside the configuration directory (e.g. `/usr/local/etc/trafficserver` or `/etc/trafficserver`),
  add the following directive:

  ```
  header_rewrite.so strip_proxy.conf

  ```
* Add the following to a new file named `strip_proxy.conf` in the same directory:

  ```
  cond %{READ_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK}
  rm-header Proxy

  ```

### HAProxy

This will strip the header off requests:

```
http-request del-header Proxy

```

If your version of HAProxy is old (i.e. `1.4` or earlier), you may not have the `http-request del-header` directive.
If so, you must also take care that headers are stripped from requests served after the first one over an HTTP 1.1
keep-alive connection. (i.e. take special note of the limitation described in the first paragraph of [the 1.4 âheader
manipulationâ documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.4/configuration.html#6))

### Varnish

For Varnish, the following should unset the header. Add it to the pre-existing vcl\_recv section:

```
sub vcl_recv {
    [...]
    unset req.http.proxy;
    [...]
}

```
### OpenBSD relayd

For relayd, the following should remove the header. Add it to a pre-existing filter:

```
http protocol httpfilter {
        match request header remove "Proxy"
}

```
### lighttpd

#### <= 1.4.40

To reject requests containing a `Proxy` header

* Create `/path/to/deny-proxy.lua`, read-only to lighttpd, with the content:

  ```
  if (lighty.request["Proxy"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end

  ```
* Modify `lighttpd.conf` to load `mod_magnet` and run the above lua code:

  ```
  server.modules += ( "mod_magnet" )
  magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua" )

  ```

#### lighttpd2 (development)

To strip the `Proxy` header from the request, add the following to `lighttpd.conf`:

```
req_header.remove "Proxy";

```
### Microsoft IIS with PHP or a CGI framework

For detailed information about mitigating httpoxy on IIS, you should
head to the official [Microsoft article KB3179800](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3179800), which covers
the below mitigations in greater detail.

Also important to know: httpoxy does not affect any Microsoft Web Frameworks, e.g. not ASP.NET nor Active Server Pages.
But if you have installed PHP or any other third party framework on top of IIS, we recommend applying mitigation steps
to protect from httpoxy attacks. You can either block requests containing a `Proxy` header, or clear the header. (The header
is safe to block, because browsers will not generally send it at all).

To *block* requests that contain a `Proxy` header (the preferred solution), run the following command line.

```
appcmd set config /section:requestfiltering /+requestlimits.headerLimits.[header='proxy',sizelimit='0']

```

**Note:** `appcmd.exe` is not typically in the path and can be found in the `%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv` directory

To *clear* the value of the header, use the following URL Rewrite rule:

```
<system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
        <rules>
            <rule name="Erase HTTP_PROXY" patternSyntax="Wildcard">
                <match url="*.*" />
                <serverVariables>
                    <set name="HTTP_PROXY" value="" />
                </serverVariables>
                <action type="None" />
            </rule>
        </rules>
    </rewrite>
</system.webServer>

```

**Note:** URL Rewrite is a downloadable add-in for IIS and is not included in a default IIS installation.

### Hiawatha

You can block any request containing a `Proxy` header (or ban the sending client) via the UrlToolkit:

```
UrlToolkit {
  ToolkitID = block_httpoxy
  Header Proxy .* DenyAccess
}

```

See more information at the [hiawatha blog](https://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/weblog/115)

### LiteSpeed Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 5.0.19` or `>= 5.1.7` to mitigate. You can do this manually with one of these commands, or youâll get
an upgrade notification soon.

```
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.0.19 # or
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.1.7

```

See more information at the [litespeed blog](http://blog.litespeedtech.com/2016/07/18/the-httpoxy-vulnerability-has-been-taken-care-of-by-litespeed-automatically/)

### h2o Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 2.0.2` and add this to your configuration:

```
setenv:
  HTTP_PROXY: ""

```

More information can be found in this [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/996).

### Other CGI software and applications

Please let us know of other places where httpoxy is found. Weâd be happy to help you communicate fixes for your platform,
server or library if you are affected. Contact contact@httpoxy.org to let us
know. Or create a PR or issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org) in GitHub.

## Ineffective fixes in PHP

Userland PHP fixes donât work. Donât bother:

* Using `unset($_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY'])` does not affect the value returned from `getenv()`, so is not an effective
  mitigation
* Using `putenv('HTTP_PROXY=')` does not work either (to be precise: it only works if that value is coming from an
  actual environment variable rather than a header â so, it cannot be used for mitigation)

## Prevention

### Summary

* If you can avoid it, do not deploy into environments where the CGI data is merged into the actual environment variables
* Use and expect `CGI_HTTP_PROXY` to set the proxy for a CGI applicationâs internal requests, if necessary
  + You can still support `HTTP_PROXY`, but you must assert that CGI is not in use
  + In PHP, check `PHP_SAPI == 'cli'`
  + Otherwise, a simple check is to not trust `HTTP_PROXY` if `REQUEST_METHOD` is also set. RFC 3875 seems to require
    this meta-variable:

    > The `REQUEST_METHOD` meta-variable MUST be set to the method which should be used by the script to process the request

### Donât Trust `HTTP_PROXY` Under CGI

To put it plainly: there is no way to trust the value of an `HTTP_` env var in a CGI environment. They cannot be
distinguished from request headers according to the specification. So, *any* usage of `HTTP_PROXY` in a CGI context is
suspicious.

If you need to configure the proxy of a CGI application via an environment variable, use a variable name that will
never conflict with request headers. That is: one that does not begin with `HTTP_`. We strongly recommend you go for
`CGI_HTTP_PROXY`. (As seen in Ruby and libwww-perlâs mitigations for this issue.)

### PHP

CLI-only code may safely trust `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` or `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`. But bear in mind that code written
for the CLI context often ends up running in a SAPI eventually, particularly utility or library code. And, with open
source code, that might not even be your doing. So, if you are going to rely on `HTTP_PROXY` at all, you should guard
that code with a check of the `PHP_SAPI` constant.

### Network Configuration as Prevention

A defense-in-depth strategy that can combat httpoxy (and entire classes of other security problems) is to severely restrict
the outgoing requests your web application can make to an absolute minimum. For example, if a web application is
firewalled in such a way that it *cannot* make outgoing HTTP requests, an attacker will not be able to receive
the âmisproxiedâ requests (because the web application is prevented from connecting to the attacker).

### HTTPS

And, of course, another defense-in-depth strategy that works is to use HTTPS for internal requests, not just for
securing your siteâs connections to the outside world. HTTPS requests arenât affected by `HTTP_PROXY`.

## How It Works

Using PHP as an example, because it is illustrative. PHP has a method called `getenv()`[1](#fn:php-getenv).

There is a common vulnerability in many PHP libraries and applications, introduced by confusing
`getenv` for a method that only returns environment variables. In fact, getenv() is closer to the
`$_SERVER` superglobal: it contains both environment variables and user-controlled data.

Specifically, when PHP is running under a CGI-like server, the HTTP request headers (data supplied
by the client) are merged into the `$_SERVER` superglobal under keys beginning with `HTTP_`. This is
the same information that `getenv` reads from.

When a user sends a request with a `Proxy` header, the header appears to the PHP application as `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`.
Some common PHP libraries have been trusting this value, even when run in a CGI/SAPI environment.

Reading and trusting `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` is exactly the same vulnerability, but tends to happen much less often
(perhaps because of getenvâs name, perhaps because the semantics of the `$_SERVER` superglobal are better understood among
the community).

### Minimal example code

Note that these examples require deployment into a vulnerable environment before there is actually a vulnerability
(e.g. php-fpm, or Apacheâs `ScriptAlias`)

#### PHP

```
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$client->get('http://api.internal/?secret=foo')

```
#### Python

```
from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
def application(environ, start_response):
    requests.get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
CGIHandler().run(application)

```
#### Go

```
cgi.Serve(
    http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        res, _ := http.Get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
        // [...]

```

More complete PoC repos (using Docker, and testing with an actual listener for the proxied request) have been prepared
under the [httpoxy Github organization](https://github.com/httpoxy).

## Why It Happened

Under the CGI spec, headers are provided mixed into the environment variables. (These are formally known as
âProtocol-Specific Meta-Variablesâ[2](#fn:meta-variables)). Thatâs just the way the spec works, not a failure or bug.

The goal of the code, in most of the vulnerabilities, is to find the correct proxy to use, when auto-configuring a
client for the internal HTTP request made shortly after. This task in Ruby could be completed by
the `find_proxy` method of `URI::Generic`, which notes:

> `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY` are treated specially under the CGI environment, because `HTTP_PROXY` may be set by Proxy:
> header. So `HTTP_PROXY` is not used. `http_proxy` is not used too if the variable is case insensitive. `CGI_HTTP_PROXY`
> can be used instead.
>
> From the [Ruby stdlib documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI/Generic.html#method-i-find_proxy)

Other instances of the same vulnerability are present in other languages. For example, when
using Goâs `net/http/cgi` module, and deploying as a CGI application. This indicates the vulnerability
is a standard danger in CGI environments.

## History of httpoxy

This bug was first discovered over 15 years ago. The timeline goes something like:

March 2001

The issue is discovered in libwww-perl and fixed. Reported by Randal L. Schwartz. [3](#fn:perl-bug)

April 2001

The issue is discovered in curl, and fixed there too (albeit probably not for Windows). Reported by Cris Bailiff. [4](#fn:curl-bug)

July 2012

In implementing `HTTP_PROXY` for `Net::HTTP`, the Ruby team notice and avoid the potential issue. Nice work Akira Tanaka! [5](#fn:ruby-ref)

November 2013

The issue is mentioned on the NGINX mailing list. The user humbly points out the issue: âunless
Iâm missing something, which is very possibleâ. No, Jonathan Matthews, you were exactly right! [6](#fn:nginx-ref)

February 2015

The issue is mentioned on the Apache httpd-dev mailing list. Spotted by Stefan Fritsch. [7](#fn:apache-ref)

July 2016

Scott Geary, an engineer at Vend, found an instance of the bug in the wild. The Vend security team found the vulnerability
was still exploitable in PHP, and present in many modern languages and libraries. We started to disclose to security response teams.

So, the bug was lying dormant for years, like a latent infection: pox. We imagine that many people may have found the issue over
the years, but never investigated its scope in other languages and libraries. If youâve found a historical discussion
of interest that weâve missed, let us know. You can contact contact@httpoxy.org
or create an issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org).

## CVEs

httpoxy has a number of CVEs assigned. These cover the cases where

* a language or CGI implementation makes the `Proxy` header available in such a way that the application cannot tell whether
  it is a real environment variable, or
* an application trusts the value of the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable by default in a CGI environment (but only where that application should have been
  able to tell it came from a request)

The assigned CVEs so far:

* CVE-2016-5385: PHP
* CVE-2016-5386: Go
* CVE-2016-5387: Apache HTTP Server
* CVE-2016-5388: Apache Tomcat

* CVE-2016-1000111: Python Twisted
* CVE-2016-1000212: lighttpd

We suspect there may be more CVEs coming for httpoxy, as less common software is checked over. If you
want to get a CVE assigned for an httpoxy issue, there are a couple of options:

* For open source code projects, you can use the [Distributed Weakness Filing Project](https://distributedweaknessfiling.org/) (DWF).
  They have a simple way to report (public) issues using the form at [iwantacve.org](https://iwantacve.org/)
* For closed source code projects, you can talk to [MITRE, or one of their participating CNAs/vendors/coordinators](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html).

## Thanks and Further Coverage

Weâll be linking to official announcements from affected teams here, as they become available.

Over the past two weeks, the Vend security team worked to disclose the issue responsibly to as many affected parties as we
could. Weâd like to thank the members of:

* The Red Hat Product Security team, who provided extremely useful advice and access to their experience disclosing
  widespread vulnerabilities - if youâre sitting on a big or complicated disclosure, theyâre a great resource to reach
  out to for help.
* The language and implementation teams, who kept to disclosure norms and provided lively discussion.

Thereâs an [extra](extra.html) page with some meta-discussion on the whole named disclosure thing and contact details.

like, no permission/attribution necessary).

Iâve put together some more opinionated notes on httpoxy on [my Medium account](https://medium.com/%40nzdominic).

Dominic Scheirlinck and the httpoxy disclosure team

## Description

[![@bradfitz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2621?u=6deb06d9916328265486504f364c80ec2d969f2c&v=4&size=48)](/bradfitz)[bradfitz](https://github.com/bradfitz)opened [on Jul 18, 2016](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16405#issue-166020682)

Because,

* The CGI spec defines that incoming request header "Foo: Bar" maps to environment variable HTTP\_FOO == "Bar". (see RFC 3875 4.1.18)
* The HTTP\_PROXY environment variable is conventionally used to configure the HTTP proxy for HTTP clients (and is respected by default for Go's net/http.Client and Transport)

That means Go programs running in a CGI environment (as a child process under a CGI host) are vulnerable to an incoming request containing "Proxy: attacker.com:1234", setting HTTP\_PROXY, and changing where Go by default proxies all outbound HTTP requests.

This is [CVE-2016-5386](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9hq4-732f-9vgf "CVE-2016-5386"), aka <https://httpoxy.org/>

The environment variable "HTTP\_PROXY" is used by numerous web clients, including Go's net/http package, to specify a proxy server to use for HTTP and, in some cases, HTTPS requests. This meant that when a CGI-based web application ran, an attacker could specify a proxy server which the application then used for subsequent outgoing requests, allowing a man-in-the-middle attack. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2016-10-13 08:59:53 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2016-07-08 03:27:25 UTC  ``` Dominic Scheirlinck of VendHQ reports:  Many software projects and vendors have implemented support for the “Proxy” request header in their respective CGI implementations and languages by creating the “HTTP_PROXY” environmental variable based on the header value. When this variable is used (in many cases automatically by various HTTP client libraries) any outgoing requests generated in turn from the attackers original request can be redirected to an attacker controlled proxy. This allows attackers to view potentially sensitive information, reply with malformed data, or to hold connections open causing a potential denial of service.   The Go programming language can automatically populate the HTTP_PROXY environmental variable with a user supplied "Proxy" header.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2016-07-08 03:27:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Scott Geary (VendHQ)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c2)  Doran Moppert    2016-07-08 05:49:05 UTC  ``` To go package "net/http" honours $HTTP_PROXY as well as $http_proxy when making outbound requests, making CGI programs written in go vulnerable.  Go HTTP servers that do not invoke CGI scripts are not directly vulnerable:    - the HTTP_PROXY var is not set in the server process's environment   - the HTTP_PROXY var is not set in subprocesses launched directly by os.exec   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c4)  Stefan Cornelius    2016-07-18 15:35:24 UTC  ```  Created golang tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1357601](show_bug.cgi?id=1357601 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-5386 golang: Go: sets environmental variable based on user supplied Proxy request header [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1357602](show_bug.cgi?id=1357602 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-5386 golang: Go: sets environmental variable based on user supplied Proxy request header [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1353798#c8)  Summer Long    2016-07-26 00:52:17 UTC  ``` Upstream announcement on golang-announce mailing list:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-announce/7jZDOQ8f8tM>  [security] Go 1.6.3 and 1.7rc2 are released  Chris Broadfoot 	 Jul 19  A security-related issue was recently reported in Go's net/http/cgi package and net/http package when used in a CGI environment. Go 1.6.3 and Go 1.7rc2 will contain a fix for this issue.  Go versions 1.0-1.6.2 and 1.7rc1 are vulnerable to an input validation flaw in the CGI components resulting in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable being set by the incoming Proxy header. This environment variable was also used to set the outgoing proxy, enabling an attacker to insert a proxy into outgoing requests of a CGI program.  This is [CVE-2016-5386](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5386) and was addressed by this change: <https://golang.org/cl/25010>, tracked in this issue: <https://golang.org/issue/16405>  The Go team would like to thank Dominic Scheirlinck for coordinating disclosure of this issue across multiple languages and CGI environments. Read more about "httpoxy" here: <https://httpoxy.org/>  Go 1.6.3 also adds support for macOS Sierra. See <https://golang.org/issue/16354> for details.  Downloads are available at <https://golang.org/dl> for all supported platforms.

## Synopsis

Moderate: golang security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1538)

## Topic

An update for golang is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The golang packages provide the Go programming language compiler.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: golang (1.6.3). (BZ#1346331)

Security Fix(es):

* An input-validation flaw was discovered in the Go programming language built in CGI implementation, which set the environment variable "HTTP\_PROXY" using the incoming "Proxy" HTTP-request header. The environment variable "HTTP\_PROXY" is used by numerous web clients, including Go's net/http package, to specify a proxy server to use for HTTP and, in some cases, HTTPS requests. This meant that when a CGI-based web application ran, an attacker could specify a proxy server which the application then used for subsequent outgoing requests, allowing a man-in-the-middle attack. (CVE-2016-5386)

Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting this issue.
