{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a naming convention in RFC 3875 (CGI), which converts HTTP header field names to uppercase, replaces hyphens with underscores, and prepends \"HTTP_\", leading to a collision where a client-provided \"Proxy\" header becomes the server's internal HTTP_PROXY environment variable. This environment variable is then used by certain libraries to configure outgoing proxies.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision (CWE-807)",
      "External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores (CWE-454)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on internal server subrequests or direct the server to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts. This can lead to proxying of outgoing HTTP requests, redirection of connections to arbitrary hosts and ports, and potential denial of service by tying up server resources through a malicious proxy.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing the `Proxy` header to a vulnerable server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable server. No authentication or specific privileges are required."
