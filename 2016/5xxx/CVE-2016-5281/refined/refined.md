Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-5281:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) issue in the `DOMSVGLength` object within Mozilla products (specifically Firefox and Thunderbird). This occurs when manipulating SVG content through JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The `DOMSVGLength` object has attributes `nsSVGLength2* mVal` and `RefPtr<nsSVGElement> mSVGElement`. During cycle collection, `mSVGElement` is cleared, allowing the associated SVG element to be destroyed. However, the `mVal` pointer, which may point to data within the destroyed element, is not cleared, resulting in a dangling pointer. This can then be used in subsequent operations, leading to a use-after-free.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash, which is deemed potentially exploitable and able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. This is due to the use-after-free leading to memory corruption.
*   **Information disclosure:** There's potential for an attacker to read memory that they shouldn't have access to.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web pages with malicious SVG content:** The vulnerability is triggered when manipulating SVG content using JavaScript in a web page.
*   **Malicious add-on updates:** An attacker able to get a mis-issued certificate for a Mozilla web site could send malicious add-on updates which contain this vulnerability. This particular attack vector depends on an additional certificate pinning expiration issue (CVE-2016-5284)
*   This vulnerability is not limited to remote exploitation through websites. Local or authenticated users could trigger it via local or non-mail application interactions with SVG content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to control SVG content:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the content of an SVG image and its associated JavaScript.
*   **Network access**: For remote attacks, network access is needed to serve the malicious SVG content or send the malicious updates. Local or authenticated attacks require local access to the system.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to how text direction is changed, or when `aria-owns` attribute is set in accessibility functionality.
*   The vulnerability is present in Firefox versions ranging from 31 to 50 and Thunderbird version 45.4.
*   The vulnerability was introduced by the implementation of WebIDL in the SVGLength implementation ([bug 886416](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=886416)).
*   The fix involves ensuring that the `mVal` pointer is cleared during cycle collection to avoid dangling pointers.
*   Red Hat assigned the vulnerability a "high" severity rating.
*   Mozilla has classified this as a high impact vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is also present in Thunderbird, but can not be exploited through email due to scripting being disabled when reading mail.
