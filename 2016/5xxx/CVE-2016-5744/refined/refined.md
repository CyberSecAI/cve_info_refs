- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in Siemens SIMATIC WinCC products. Specifically, specially crafted packets sent to SIMATIC WinCC could allow unauthenticated users to extract arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation (CWE-20) leading to arbitrary file extraction.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can extract arbitrary files from the WinCC station.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted network packets to a vulnerable SIMATIC WinCC system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable system.
