Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-5078:

**CVE-2016-5078**

*   **Vulnerable Product:** Paessler PRTG Network Management System (NMS)
*   **Vulnerable Version:** 16.2.24.3791
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization of data obtained via SNMP. Specifically, the system fails to properly sanitize the `sysDescr`, `sysLocation`, and `sysContact` fields from SNMP responses.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The injected code is stored in the system and executed when a user views the affected page.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The vulnerability is exploited through the network SNMP discovery process. A malicious actor configures a device to respond to SNMP queries with malicious JavaScript or HTML code in the `sysDescr`, `sysLocation`, and `sysContact` OID objects. When this device is discovered by PRTG, the malicious payload is stored.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to introduce a device with a malicious SNMP configuration to be discovered by the Paessler PRTG instance. No prior authentication to the PRTG system is required.
*   **Impact:** When an authenticated user views the "System Information" page of the compromised device in the PRTG web console, the malicious JavaScript or HTML code executes in the context of that user's browser session. This enables the attacker to:
    *   Modify system configurations.
    *   Compromise data.
    *   Potentially gain control of the PRTG product.
    *   Launch attacks against the authenticated user's system.

**Technical Details:**

*   The malicious code is injected via the following SNMP OIDs:
    *   `sysDescr` (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0)
    *   `sysLocation` (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0)
    *   `sysContact` (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0)
*   The injected code executes when the user views the "System Information" page for the device in the PRTG web interface.
*   The provided example demonstrates injecting the following HTML code via the `sysDescr` OID: `<embed src=//ld1.us/4.swf>`. This would embed a Flash file in the authenticated user's browser when the page is viewed, but any valid javascript or html could be injected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in PRTG version 16.2.24.4045.
*   The vulnerability is similar to other XSS vulnerabilities in other NMS products documented in the same report, all stemming from a lack of input sanitization on data obtained from SNMP.
