  "CVE-2016-5251": {
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 48.0 allows remote attackers to spoof the location bar via crafted characters in the media type of a data: URL.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of url-encoded values within the mediatype of `data:` URLs. Specifically, the browser would decode non-ASCII and emoji characters in a way that allowed for spoofing of the address bar.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper URL parsing",
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "URL Spoofing"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit allows an attacker to control the location bar's display, leading users to believe they are on a different site than the one actually loaded. This can facilitate phishing attacks or other malicious activities where users are tricked into interacting with a spoofed site.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted data: URL"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to cause the victim to navigate to a crafted `data:` URL. This can be accomplished through various techniques such as embedding the URL in a link, redirecting or using JavaScript."
