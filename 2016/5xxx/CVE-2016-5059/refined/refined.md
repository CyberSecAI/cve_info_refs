The provided content is related to CVE-2016-5059.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The mobile application caches screenshots of the current page when the iPad's home button is pressed. This practice can store sensitive data, such as plain text passwords, in the snapshot folder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application caches screenshots without sanitizing sensitive data.
- Sensitive information, such as gateway passwords, is displayed in plain text and captured in the screenshot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the iPad can view cached screenshots and obtain sensitive data, including passwords.
- This could allow unauthorized access to the device's configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the iPad device where the application is installed.
- An attacker could steal or otherwise obtain the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have physical access to the device and be able to browse the file system to access the cached screenshot folder.
