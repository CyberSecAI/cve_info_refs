- **Potential data breach:** Compromised accounts can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access
- User initiated password change

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience application.
