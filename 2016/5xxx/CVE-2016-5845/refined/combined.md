7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

SAP distributes software and packages using an archive program called SAPCAR. This program uses a custom archive file
format. Vulnerabilities were found in the extraction of specially crafted archive files, that could lead to denial of
service conditions or escalation of privileges.

The code that handles the extraction of archive files is prone to privilege escalation and denial of service
vulnerabilities.

7.1. Denial of service via invalid file names

[CVE-2016-5845] Denial of service vulnerability due the SAPCAR program not checking the return value of file operations
when extracting files. This might result in the program crashing when trying to extract files from an specially crafted
archive file that contains invalid file names for the target platform. Of special interest are applications or
solutions that makes use of SAPCAR in an automated way.

The following is a proof of concept to demonstrate the vulnerability:

        $ xxd SAPCAR_crash.SAR
        0000000: 4341 5220 322e 3031 4452 0081 0000 0f00  CAR 2.01DR......

        $ ./SAPCAR -dvf SAPCAR_crash.SAR
        SAPCAR: processing archive SAPCAR_crash.SAR (version 2.01)
        d input-dir/inp#t
        SAPCAR: checksum error in input-dir/inp#t (error 12). No such file or director

        $ ./SAPCAR -xvf SAPCAR_crash.SAR
        SAPCAR: processing archive SAPCAR_crash.SAR (version 2.01)
        x input-dir/inp#t
        Segmentation fault

7.2. Race condition on permission change

[CVE-2016-5847] Race condition vulnerability due to the way the SAPCAR program change the permissions of extracted
files. If a malicious local user has access to a directory where a user is extracting files using SAPCAR, the attacker
might use this vulnerability to change the permissions of arbitrary files belonging to the user.

The SAPCAR program writes the file being extracted and after closing it, the program changes the permissions to the
ones set on the archive file. There's a time gap between the creating of the file and the change of the permissions.
During this time frame, a malicious local user can replace the extracted file with a hard link to a file belonging to
another user, resulting in the SAPCAR program changing the permissions on the hard-linked file to be the same as that
of the compressed file.

The following is a proof of concept to demonstrate the vulnerability:

      $ xxd SAPCAR_race_condition.SAR
      0000000: 4341 5220 322e 3031 5247 b481 0000 2b00  CAR 2.01RG....+.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Denial of Service Attacks: SAP Security Notes August 2016

By:
[JP Perez-Etchegoyen](#author)

August 9, 2016

Today, SAP released their latest batch of monthly Security Notes. Despite this month not being specifically critical, **Denial of Service** attacks are a central point of concern. A [Denial of Service](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denial_of_Service) (DoS) attack intends to make one or more resource unavailable. In the case of SAP, DoS attacks could be a partial and affect only a specific program or database, or they could be complete, taking all SAP infrastructure offline. This month, there are only 16 new Security Notes, and 13 updates to previously published security notes. The CVSS scores we’ve outlined below were defined by our Research Labs based on a few criteria including impact on availability, and how easy it is to exploit the vulnerability. Out of the 16 new Security Notes released this month, four are categorized as DoS attacks. Of those four, two are considered “high risk” scoring a 7.5 CVSS – one of which was reported by the [Onapsis Research Labs](https://onapsis.com/research).

## Denial of Service SAP Security Notes

This month has the largest amount of Denial Of Service Security Notes so far in 2016. Historically speaking, if we take a look at previously released SAP Security Notes, July and August have more DoS vulnerabilities than the entire first half of the year. This year SAP has published 10 of 12 SAP Security Notes historically titled as Denial of Service bugs (there are also other 39 SAP Security Notes marked as “Potential DoS attack”).

![aug 1 ](https://onapsis.com/wp-content/uploads/aug_1.png)

**This month’s SAP security notes categorized as Denial of Service are:**

* 2292714: Denial of service (DOS) vulnerability in Memory Snapshot Creation; CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.5 / 10
* 2313835: Denial of service (DOS) in SAP Internet Communication Manager CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.5 / 10
* 2296909: Denial of service (DOS) vulnerability in BPM; CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.4 / 10
* 2312905: Denial of service (DOS) in SAPCAR; CVSS v3 Base Score: 3.4 / 10

The first two vulnerabilities, (including the SAP Security Note 2292714 reported by Onapsis) have the highest CVSS score for this type of attacks in SAP (including all past security notes). We never publish details of the security notes before 90 days after their publication, due to our responsible disclosure policy, but it is important to mention that the main difference between the ones with the highest score and the other ones are that both can be **remotely exploited and with low attack complexity**.

## How bad can a Denial of Service on SAP systems be?

According to [a recent study](https://onapsis.com/ponemon-report) on SAP cybersecurity released by the Ponemon Institute, **systems taken offline can represent an average cost for the company of $4.5 millions dollars**. Since business continuity is based on SAP systems staying online, sometimes CVSS scores or vulnerability descriptions are not enough to represent how a simple bug can lead to a significant loss for companies.

## Top 5 SAP Denial of Service Security Notes of All Time:

As previously explained, 7.5 CVSS v3 score is the highest scoring of the Denial of Service SAP Security Notes to date. Based on the scoring and affected components, here’s a summary of the most important notes of all time with this scoring. Two of these were discovered by our Onapsis Research Labs. August notes were not included for this analysis:

* 1.**#2262710:** [Denial of service (DOS) vulnerability in HANA DP Agent](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2262710) (Apr16). Discovered by Onapsis, this note corrects how SAP HANA DP handles memory. Initially, the agent allocates memory based on the “packet length” field of that protocol and doesn’t free that memory until all bytes are transmitted. However, by abusing this behavior, a remote unauthenticated attacker could send customized packets to allocate a large amount of memory in the SAP HANA DP Agent server rendering it unavailable to other users. An advisory for this vulnerability will be published soon.
* 2. **#2165583:** [SAP HANA secure configuration of internal communication](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2165583) (Nov15). SAP HANA internal services could be accessed without authentication if the HANA system is insecurely configured and no other security measures are in place. This could allow a full compromise of system availability, among others. An advisory for this vulnerability can be downloaded [here](https://onapsis.com/research/security-advisories/SAP-HANA-trexnet-TNS-information-disclosure).
* 3. **#2306571:** [Denial of service (DOS) in SAP Data Services](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2306571) (Jun16). SAP Data Services allows an attacker to prevent legitimate users from accessing the Metadata Service from Workbench when attacker sends a crafted packet. Thus causing service disruptions during development of data services jobs.
* 4. **#2330839:** [Denial of service (DOS) in multiple SAP Sybase products](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2330839) (July16). An Open Server application may crash with a segmentation violation preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
* 5. **#2258784:** [Denial of service (DOS) vulnerability in Enqueue Server](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2258784) (Apr16). Standalone Enqueue Server (ENSA) allows an attacker to prevent legitimate users from accessing a service, either by crashing or flooding the service.

## Other Notes Summary

The following box-plot graph illustrates the distribution of CVSS scores across the released Security Notes. As previously mentioned, August notes are not particularly critical compared with last month and the year average:

![Aug 2](https://onapsis.com/wp-content/uploads/aug_2.png)

The box-plot graph is used to show where the most vulnerabilities are concentrated, and identifies the most and least critical value notes. In both cases, this month shows lower CVSS scoring compared to July and the year average. Despite what we already explained in the previous section, Denial Of Service bugs can be more dangerous than the CVSS score depicts. The below graph summarizes the types of vulnerabilities fixed this month:

![aug 3](https://onapsis.com/wp-content/uploads/aug_3.png)

Finally, considering non-DOS notes, there are three high impact notes this month:

* **#2319506:** [SQL Injection vulnerability in Database Monitors for Oracle](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2319506): this is a traditional SQL injection bug where certain input parameters of function modules are not properly sanitized. Injecting specific malicious queries could lead to sensitive data exposure, and could allow the attacker to modify or delete data from database, among other actions. CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.2 / 10.
* **#1477597:** [Unauthorized modification of stored content in NW KMC:](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1477597) malicious users can abuse this vulnerability and modify application content without authorization. This can lead to stored cross site scripting attacks, where the attacker could render the content automatically without the need of individually target the victims. No CVSS published.
* **#1718230:**  [Unauthorized modification of displayed content in StratBuild:](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1718230) an attacker can modify the content without permissions. In this case the attack could lead to a reflected cross-site scripting attack, that can be used for instance, to steal another user’s authentication information. No CVSS published.

The goal of this analysis is to provide SAP clients with the latest information about newly released SAP security notes and vulnerabilities affecting their SAP systems. We hope that this post will help to prompt a timely update to systems in order to ensure that newly disclosed vulnerabilities are mitigated as quickly as possible. The [Onapsis Research Labs](https://onapsis.com/research) are currently in the process of updating the Onapsis Security Platform to incorporate these newly published vulnerabilities. This will allow you to check whether your systems are up to date with these latest SAP Security Notes, and ensures that those systems are configured with the appropriate level of security to meet your audit and compliance requirements. Stay tuned for next month’s SAP Security Notes analysis.
