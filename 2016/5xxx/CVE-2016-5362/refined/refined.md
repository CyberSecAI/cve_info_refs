      "type": "vulnerability",
      "description": "Neutron anti-spoof protection bypass in OpenStack Neutron. By forging DHCP discovery messages or non-IP traffic, such as ARP or ICMPv6, an instance may spoof IP or MAC source addresses on attached networks resulting in denial of services and/or traffic interception. When L2population isnâ€™t used, other tenants attached to a shared network are also vulnerable. Neutron setups using the IPTables firewall driver are affected.",

      "type": "mitigation",
      "description": "The vulnerability was fixed by updating the IptablesFirewallDriver to prevent spoofing other instances or a routers MAC and/or IP addresses. The rule to permit DHCP discovery and request messages was too permissive, it did not enforce the source MAC or IP address. This was fixed by splitting the fixed DHCP rules into two, one for the discovery and request messages which take place before the instance has bound an IP address and a second to permit DHCP renewals.",
