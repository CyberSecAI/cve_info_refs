- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience does not enforce minimum password lengths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of minimum password length enforcement.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Increased susceptibility to brute-force attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system and sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting the user authentication process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or user interaction required; an attacker can attempt brute-force attacks remotely without needing to be authenticated.
