{
  "CVE-2016-5432": {
    "Description": "The ovirt-engine-provisiondb utility did not correctly sanitize the authentication details used with the \"--provision*db\" options from the output before storing them in log files. This could allow an attacker with read access to these log files to obtain sensitive information such as passwords.",
    "Root cause": "The ovirt-engine-provisiondb utility was logging database authentication details, including passwords, in plain text to log files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of authentication details in log files.",
      "Storage of sensitive information (passwords) in plain text."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with read access to the log files could obtain sensitive information such as database passwords.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to gain read access to the log files where the database credentials are being stored.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have sufficient privileges to read the server's log files."
  }
