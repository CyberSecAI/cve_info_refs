- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Huawei smart phones.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to crash the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious app which has the permissions of some modules. The attacker could then use the malicious app to send a malformed message which causes a buffer overflow and crashes the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to install a malicious app and the malicious app requires permissions for some modules.
