## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2016/10/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, October 12, 2016

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 54 to the stable channel - 54.0.2840.59 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 54.0.2840.59 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/53.0.2785.143..54.0.2840.59?pretty=fuller&n=10000).  Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 54.
Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [21](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0-M54) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[654782](https://crbug.com/654782)] CVE-2016-5194: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), or [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).
