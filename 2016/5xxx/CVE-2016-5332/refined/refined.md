- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Directory traversal vulnerability in vRealize Log Insight.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal, allowing access to files/directories outside the intended scope.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Partial information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**:  Not explicitly stated, but implied to be through the web interface or API of vRealize Log Insight. The attacker would likely use specially crafted requests containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../") to access unintended locations on the filesystem.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need network access to the vRealize Log Insight server. No mention of authentication requirements for the vulnerability.
