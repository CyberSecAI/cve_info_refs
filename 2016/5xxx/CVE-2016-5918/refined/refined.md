- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application displays the obfuscated Tivoli Storage Manager password in application trace output when the password access option is set to prompt and the password is changed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Password disclosure through application tracing. The password, though obfuscated, is still exposed in the trace logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor with access to the trace files can potentially recover the obfuscated password, leading to unauthorized access to the Tivoli Storage Manager.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to the trace files generated by the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Access to the server where Tivoli Storage Manager HSM for Windows is installed and has tracing enabled and the trace logs that are generated by the application. The attacker must also be able to reverse the obfuscation to obtain the original password.
