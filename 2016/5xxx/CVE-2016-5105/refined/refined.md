Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter emulation in QEMU.
- Specifically, the `megasas_dcmd_cfg_read` function, which is used to read device configuration data via MegaRAID Firmware Interface (MFI) commands, uses a local data buffer without initializing it first.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Information Leakage:** Due to the uninitialized local buffer, the function could leak sensitive host memory data located on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A privileged user inside the guest operating system could exploit this flaw to read arbitrary bytes from the host's memory, potentially revealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Guest OS Access:** The attack requires a privileged user or process within the guest operating system.
- **MFI Command:** The attacker must trigger the vulnerable code path by sending a specific MFI command to read the device configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Access in Guest:** The attacker needs to have administrative or root-level privileges inside the virtual machine.
- **Ability to send MFI commands:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the emulated MegaRAID controller and send MFI commands.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Li Qiang of Qihoo 360 Inc.
- A patch was created to initialize the data buffer before use, resolving the leak.
- Affected Ubuntu versions are 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS.
- Affected Debian version is 8 "Jessie".
