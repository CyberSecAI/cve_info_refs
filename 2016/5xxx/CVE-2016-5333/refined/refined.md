Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2016-5333:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A default public SSH key, used during the build process of VMware's Photon OS, was unintentionally included in the original Photon OS 1.0 and 3.0 OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inclusion of a Default Public SSH Key:** The vulnerability stems from the presence of a public SSH key within the released OVA images. This public key corresponds to a private key held by the build environment.
- **Shared Credentials:** The same public key was present across all instances of Photon OS built using the vulnerable OVA, meaning that a single corresponding private key could be used to access all of them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker possessing the corresponding private key could gain unauthorized SSH access to any Photon OS system deployed from the vulnerable OVA.
- **System Compromise:** This unauthorized access could lead to full system compromise including data exfiltration, malware installation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers could gain access through the SSH service on the affected systems, assuming network connectivity was available and the service was exposed.
- **Exploitation of Default Key:** The core attack vector is the use of the pre-existing private key to gain unauthorized access to any instance of the vulnerable OS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware that the Photon OS 1.0 or 3.0 OVAs included the default public key.
- **Possession of the Private Key:** The most crucial capability is possession of the private key corresponding to the embedded public key.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system to leverage the SSH vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- VMware internally discovered the issue and deleted all instances of the private key within their organization.
- VMware released updated OVAs to resolve the issue.
- VMware provided specific commands for users to remove the public key from affected systems as a workaround.
- The issue was specific to the original Photon OS 1.0 and 3.0 OVAs.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2016-5333.
- The advisory notes that the vulnerability is considered "High" severity.
