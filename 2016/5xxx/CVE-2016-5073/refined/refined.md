Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5073:

**1. Verification:**
The content directly mentions "R7-2016-11.1 | CVE-2016-5073 | XSS | CloudView" and "R7-2016-11.2 | CVE-2016-5073 | XSS | Cloudview" along with a description of the vulnerabilities, confirming its relevance to CVE-2016-5073.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-controlled input within the CloudView NMS software. This occurs in two distinct contexts:

   *   **R7-2016-11.1:**  The vulnerability stems from the software's inability to sanitize HTML or JavaScript code present in the `sysDescr` field of SNMP agent responses during the network discovery process.
    *   **R7-2016-11.2:** The vulnerability stems from the software's inability to sanitize HTML or JavaScript code in SNMP trap messages.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows malicious actors to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript into the application and stored persistently. Specifically:

*   The software fails to sanitize or encode the injected code before storing it in the database or logs.
*   When this stored data is later rendered within the web management console, the injected code executes within the context of an authenticated user's browser.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the following:

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a legitimate user's browser session.
*   **System Configuration Modification:** The attacker could modify the system's configuration via the web interface.
*   **Data Compromise:** The attacker can steal or manipulate data accessible within the web console context.
*   **Product Takeover:** The attacker could potentially take full control of the vulnerable NMS product.
*   **Attacks on User Hosts:** The attacker could launch attacks against the authenticated user's system, leveraging access and trust within the user's environment.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **R7-2016-11.1:**
    *   An attacker needs to have control or compromise a network device and configure its SNMP agent to include malicious code in the `sysDescr` field.
    *   When the CloudView NMS discovers this device and imports the data, the malicious code is injected.

*   **R7-2016-11.2:**
    *   An attacker can craft and send unsolicited SNMP trap messages containing malicious JavaScript or HTML code.
    *   When a user views the logs containing the trap message details, the injected code is executed.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the NMS server to deliver malicious SNMP responses (for sysDescr field) or trap messages.
*  **SNMP Agent Compromise (for sysDescr attack):** The attacker needs to have the ability to configure SNMP sysDescr field on network device.
*  **No authentication:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit the XSS via SNMP agent or traps messages.

**Summary:**
CVE-2016-5073 involves a persistent XSS vulnerability in CloudView NMS, caused by a lack of proper input sanitization of SNMP agent responses and SNMP trap messages. Exploitation can lead to a variety of attacks, including configuration modification, data compromise, system takeover and potential attacks to user's machines, and requires network access and in one vector the compromise of an SNMP agent.

This detailed analysis provides more context than the basic CVE description and outlines specific attack vectors and impacts.
