# 2016-08-11 Security Update Release

Posted on **2016-08-11** by PostgreSQL Global Development Group

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported versions of our database system, including 9.5.4, 9.4.9, 9.3.14, 9.2.18 and 9.1.23. This release fixes two security issues. It also patches a number of other bugs reported over the last three months. Users who rely on security isolation between database users should update as soon as possible. Other users should plan to update at the next convenient
downtime.

## Security Issues

Two security holes have been closed by this release:

* [CVE-2016-5423](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5423): certain nested CASE expressions can cause the server to crash.
* [CVE-2016-5424](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5424): database and role names with embedded special characters
  can allow code injection during administrative operations like pg\_dumpall.

The fix for the second issue also adds an option, -reuse-previous, to
psql's \connect command. pg\_dumpall will also refuse to handle database and
role names containing line breaks after the update. For more information on
these issues and how they affect backwards-compatibility, see the Release Notes.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

This update also fixes a number of bugs reported in the last few months. Some
of these issues affect only version 9.5, but many affect all supported versions:

* Fix misbehaviors of IS NULL/IS NOT NULL with composite values
* Fix three areas where INSERT ... ON CONFLICT failed to work properly
  with other SQL features.
* Make INET and CIDR data types properly reject bad IPv6 values
* Prevent crash in "point ## lseg" operator for NaN input
* Avoid possible crash in pg\_get\_expr()
* Fix several one-byte buffer over-reads in to\_number()
* Don't needlessly plan query if WITH NO DATA is specified
* Avoid crash-unsafe state in expensive heap\_update() paths
* Fix hint bit update during WAL replay of row locking operations
* Avoid unnecessary "could not serialize access" with FOR KEY SHARE
* Avoid crash in postgres -C when the specified variable is a null string
* Fix two issues with logical decoding and subtransactions
* Ensure that backends see up-to-date statistics for shared catalogs
* Prevent possible failure when vacuuming multixact IDs in an upgraded database
* When a manual ANALYZE specifies columns, don't reset changes\_since\_analyze
* Fix ANALYZE's overestimation of n\_distinct for columns with nulls
* Fix bug in b-tree mark/restore processing
* Fix building of large (bigger than shared\_buffers) hash indexes
* Prevent infinite loop in GiST index build with NaN values
* Fix possible crash during a nearest-neighbor indexscan
* Fix "PANIC: failed to add BRIN tuple" error
* Prevent possible crash during background worker shutdown
* Many fixes for issues in parallel pg\_dump and pg\_restore
* Make pg\_basebackup accept -Z 0 as no compression
* Make regression tests safe for Danish and Welsh locales

The libpq client library has also been updated to support future two-part
PostgreSQL version numbers. This update also contains tzdata release 2016f,
with updates for Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Morocco.

## EOL Warning for Version 9.1

PostgreSQL version 9.1 will be End-of-Life in September 2016. The project expects to only release one more update for that version. We urge users to start
planning an upgrade to a later version of PostgreSQL as soon as possible. See our
Versioning Policy for more information.

## Updating

All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or use pg\_upgrade in order to apply this update release; you may simply shut down PostgreSQL and update its binaries. Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional, post-update steps; please see the release notes for earlier versions for details.

## Synopsis

Moderate: postgresql92-postgresql security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1820)

## Topic

An update for postgresql92-postgresql is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: postgresql92-postgresql (9.2.18)

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL server handled certain SQL statements containing CASE/WHEN commands. A remote, authenticated attacker could use a specially crafted SQL statement to cause PostgreSQL to crash or disclose a few bytes of server memory or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5423)
* A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL client programs handled database and role names containing newlines, carriage returns, double quotes, or backslashes. By crafting such an object name, roles with the CREATEDB or CREATEROLE option could escalate their privileges to superuser when a superuser next executes maintenance with a vulnerable client program. (CVE-2016-5424)

Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Heikki Linnakangas as the original reporter of CVE-2016-5423; and Nathan Bossart as the original reporter of CVE-2016-5424.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

If the postgresql service is running, it will be automatically restarted after installing this update.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2606)

## Topic

An update for postgresql is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: postgresql (9.2.18).

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL server handled certain SQL statements containing CASE/WHEN commands. A remote, authenticated attacker could use a specially crafted SQL statement to cause PostgreSQL to crash or disclose a few bytes of server memory or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5423)
* A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL client programs handled database and role names containing newlines, carriage returns, double quotes, or backslashes. By crafting such an object name, roles with the CREATEDB or CREATEROLE option could escalate their privileges to superuser when a superuser next executes maintenance with a vulnerable client program. (CVE-2016-5424)

Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Heikki Linnakangas as the original reporter of CVE-2016-5423; and Nathan Bossart as the original reporter of CVE-2016-5424.

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

If the postgresql service is running, it will be automatically restarted after installing this update.

# E.22. Release 9.5.4

**Release date:** 2016-08-11

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.5.3. For information about new features in the 9.5 major release, see [Section E.26](release-9-5.html).

## E.22.1. Migration to Version 9.5.4

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.5.X.

However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 9.5.2, see [Section E.24](release-9-5-2.html).

## E.22.2. Changes

* Fix possible mis-evaluation of nested CASE-WHEN expressions (Heikki Linnakangas, Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

  A CASE expression appearing within the test value subexpression of another CASE could become confused about whether its own test value was null or not. Also, inlining of a SQL function implementing the equality operator used by a CASE expression could result in passing the wrong test value to functions called within a CASE expression in the SQL function's body. If the test values were of different data types, a crash might result; moreover such situations could be abused to allow disclosure of portions of server memory. (CVE-2016-5423)
* Fix client programs' handling of special characters in database and role names (Noah Misch, Nathan Bossart, Michael Paquier)

  Numerous places in vacuumdb and other client programs could become confused by database and role names containing double quotes or backslashes. Tighten up quoting rules to make that safe. Also, ensure that when a conninfo string is used as a database name parameter to these programs, it is correctly treated as such throughout.

  Fix handling of paired double quotes in psql's \connect and \password commands to match the documentation.

  Introduce a new -reuse-previous option in psql's \connect command to allow explicit control of whether to re-use connection parameters from a previous connection. (Without this, the choice is based on whether the database name looks like a conninfo string, as before.) This allows secure handling of database names containing special characters in pg\_dumpall scripts.

  pg\_dumpall now refuses to deal with database and role names containing carriage returns or newlines, as it seems impractical to quote those characters safely on Windows. In future we may reject such names on the server side, but that step has not been taken yet.

  These are considered security fixes because crafted object names containing special characters could have been used to execute commands with superuser privileges the next time a superuser executes pg\_dumpall or other routine maintenance operations. (CVE-2016-5424)
* Fix corner-case misbehaviors for IS NULL/IS NOT NULL applied to nested composite values (Andrew Gierth, Tom Lane)

  The SQL standard specifies that IS NULL should return TRUE for a row of all null values (thus ROW(NULL,NULL) IS NULL yields TRUE), but this is not meant to apply recursively (thus ROW(NULL, ROW(NULL,NULL)) IS NULL yields FALSE). The core executor got this right, but certain planner optimizations treated the test as recursive (thus producing TRUE in both cases), and contrib/postgres\_fdw could produce remote queries that misbehaved similarly.
* Fix "unrecognized node type" error for INSERT ... ON CONFLICT within a recursive CTE (a WITH item) (Peter Geoghegan)
* Fix INSERT ... ON CONFLICT to successfully match index expressions or index predicates that are simplified during the planner's expression preprocessing phase (Tom Lane)
* Correctly handle violations of exclusion constraints that apply to the target table of an INSERT ... ON CONFLICT command, but are not one of the selected arbiter indexes (Tom Lane)

  Such a case should raise a normal constraint-violation error, but it got into an infinite loop instead.
* Fix INSERT ... ON CONFLICT to not fail if the target table has a unique index on OID (Tom Lane)
* Make the inet and cidr data types properly reject IPv6 addresses with too many colon-separated fields (Tom Lane)
* Prevent crash in `close_ps()` (the point ## lseg operator) for NaN input coordinates (Tom Lane)

  Make it return NULL instead of crashing.
* Avoid possible crash in `pg_get_expr()` when inconsistent values are passed to it (Michael Paquier, Thomas Munro)
* Fix several one-byte buffer over-reads in `to_number()` (Peter Eisentraut)

  In several cases the `to_number()` function would read one more character than it should from the input string. There is a small chance of a crash, if the input happens to be adjacent to the end of memory.
* Do not run the planner on the query contained in CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW or CREATE TABLE AS when WITH NO DATA is specified (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

  This avoids some unnecessary failure conditions, for example if a stable function invoked by the materialized view depends on a table that doesn't exist yet.
* Avoid unsafe intermediate state during expensive paths through `heap_update()` (Masahiko Sawada, Andres Freund)

  Previously, these cases locked the target tuple (by setting its XMAX) but did not WAL-log that action, thus risking data integrity problems if the page were spilled to disk and then a database crash occurred before the tuple update could be completed.
* Fix hint bit update during WAL replay of row locking operations (Andres Freund)

  The only known consequence of this problem is that row locks held by a prepared, but uncommitted, transaction might fail to be enforced after a crash and restart.
* Avoid unnecessary "could not serialize access" errors when acquiring FOR KEY SHARE row locks in serializable mode (Álvaro Herrera)
* Make sure "expanded" datums returned by a plan node are read-only (Tom Lane)

  This avoids failures in some cases where the result of a lower plan node is referenced in multiple places in upper nodes. So far as core PostgreSQL is concerned, only array values returned by PL/pgSQL functions are at risk; but extensions might use expanded datums for other things.
* Avoid crash in postgres -C when the specified variable has a null string value (Michael Paquier)
* Prevent unintended waits for the receiver in WAL sender processes (Kyotaro Horiguchi)
* Fix possible loss of large subtransactions in logical decoding (Petru-Florin Mihancea)
* Fix failure of logical decoding when a subtransaction contains no actual changes (Marko Tiikkaja, Andrew Gierth)
* Ensure that backends see up-to-date statistics for shared catalogs (Tom Lane)

  The statistics collector failed to update the statistics file for shared catalogs after a request from a regular backend. This problem was partially masked because the autovacuum launcher regularly makes requests that did cause such updates; however, it became obvious with autovacuum disabled.
* Avoid redundant writes of the statistics files when multiple backends request updates close together (Tom Lane, Tomas Vondra)
* Avoid consuming a transaction ID during VACUUM (Alexander Korotkov)

  Some cases in VACUUM unnecessarily caused an XID to be assigned to the current transaction. Normally this is negligible, but if one is up against the XID wraparound limit, consuming more XIDs during anti-wraparound vacuums is a very bad thing.
* Prevent possible failure when vacuuming multixact IDs in an installation that has been pg\_upgrade'd from pre-9.3 (Andrew Gierth, Álvaro Herrera)

  The usual symptom of this bug is errors like "MultiXactId NNN has not been created yet -- apparent wraparound".
* When a manual ANALYZE specifies a column list, don't reset the table's changes\_since\_analyze counter (Tom Lane)

  If we're only analyzing some columns, we should not prevent routine auto-analyze from happening for the other columns.
* Fix ANALYZE's overestimation of n\_distinct for a unique or nearly-unique column with many null entries (Tom Lane)

  The nulls could get counted as though they were themselves distinct values, leading to serious planner misestimates in some types of queries.
* Prevent autovacuum from starting multiple workers for the same shared catalog (Álvaro Herrera)

  Normally this isn't much of a problem because the vacuum doesn't take long anyway; but in the case of a severely bloated catalog, it could result in all but one worker uselessly waiting instead of doing useful work on other tables.
* Fix bug in b-tree mark/restore processing (Kevin Grittner)

  This error could lead to incorrect join results or assertion failures in a merge join whose inner source node is a b-tree indexscan.
* Avoid duplicate buffer lock release when abandoning a b-tree index page deletion attempt (Tom Lane)

  This mistake prevented VACUUM from completing in some cases involving corrupt b-tree indexes.
* Fix building of large (bigger than shared\_buffers) hash indexes (Tom Lane)

  The code path used for large indexes contained a bug causing incorrect hash values to be inserted into the index, so that subsequent index searches always failed, except for tuples inserted into the index after the initial build.
* Prevent infinite loop in GiST index build for geometric columns containing NaN component values (Tom Lane)
* Fix possible crash during a nearest-neighbor (ORDER BY distance) indexscan on a contrib/btree\_gist index on an interval column (Peter Geoghegan)
* Fix "PANIC: failed to add BRIN tuple" error when attempting to update a BRIN index entry (Álvaro Herrera)
* Fix possible crash during background worker shutdown (Dmitry Ivanov)
* Fix PL/pgSQL's handling of the INTO clause within IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA commands (Tom Lane)
* Fix contrib/btree\_gin to handle the smallest possible bigint value correctly (Peter Eisentraut)
* Teach libpq to correctly decode server version from future servers (Peter Eisentraut)

  It's planned to switch to two-part instead of three-part server version numbers for releases after 9.6. Make sure that `PQserverVersion()` returns the correct value for such cases.
* Fix ecpg's code for unsigned long long array elements (Michael Meskes)
* In pg\_dump with both -c and -C options, avoid emitting an unwanted CREATE SCHEMA public command (David Johnston, Tom Lane)
* Improve handling of SIGTERM/control-C in parallel pg\_dump and pg\_restore (Tom Lane)

  Make sure that the worker processes will exit promptly, and also arrange to send query-cancel requests to the connected backends, in case they are doing something long-running such as a CREATE INDEX.
* Fix error reporting in parallel pg\_dump and pg\_restore (Tom Lane)

  Previously, errors reported by pg\_dump or pg\_restore worker processes might never make it to the user's console, because the messages went through the master process, and there were various deadlock scenarios that would prevent the master process from passing on the messages. Instead, just print everything to stderr. In some cases this will result in duplicate messages (for instance, if all the workers report a server shutdown), but that seems better than no message.
* Ensure that parallel pg\_dump or pg\_restore on Windows will shut down properly after an error (Kyotaro Horiguchi)

  Previously, it would report the error, but then just sit until manually stopped by the user.
* Make parallel pg\_dump fail cleanly when run against a standby server (Magnus Hagander)

  This usage is not supported unless --no-synchronized-snapshots is specified, but the error was not handled very well.
* Make pg\_dump behave better when built without zlib support (Kyotaro Horiguchi)

  It didn't work right for parallel dumps, and emitted some rather pointless warnings in other cases.
* Make pg\_basebackup accept -Z 0 as specifying no compression (Fujii Masao)
* Fix makefiles' rule for building AIX shared libraries to be safe for parallel make (Noah Misch)
* Fix TAP tests and MSVC scripts to work when build directory's path name contains spaces (Michael Paquier, Kyotaro Horiguchi)
* Be more predictable about reporting "statement timeout" versus "lock timeout" (Tom Lane)

  On heavily loaded machines, the regression tests sometimes failed due to reporting "lock timeout" even though the statement timeout should have occurred first.
* Make regression tests safe for Danish and Welsh locales (Jeff Janes, Tom Lane)

  Change some test data that triggered the unusual sorting rules of these locales.
* Update our copy of the timezone code to match IANA's tzcode release 2016c (Tom Lane)

  This is needed to cope with anticipated future changes in the time zone data files. It also fixes some corner-case bugs in coping with unusual time zones.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2016f for DST law changes in Kemerovo and Novosibirsk, plus historical corrections for Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Morocco.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3646-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : postgresql-9.4
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-5423 CVE-2016-5424

Several vulnerabilities have been found in PostgreSQL-9.4, a SQL
database system.

CVE-2016-5423

    Karthikeyan Jambu Rajaraman discovered that nested CASE-WHEN
    expressions are not properly evaluated, potentially leading to a
    crash or allowing to disclose portions of server memory.

CVE-2016-5424

    Nathan Bossart discovered that special characters in database and
    role names are not properly handled, potentially leading to the
    execution of commands with superuser privileges, when a superuser
    executes pg_dumpall or other routine maintenance operations.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.4.9-0+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.4 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

* Fix possible mis-evaluation of nested CASE-WHEN expressions (Heikki Linnakangas, Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

  A CASE expression appearing within the test value subexpression of another CASE could become confused about whether its own test value was null or not. Also, inlining of a SQL function implementing the equality operator used by a CASE expression could result in passing the wrong test value to functions called within a CASE expression in the SQL function's body. If the test values were of different data types, a crash might result; moreover such situations could be abused to allow disclosure of portions of server memory. (CVE-2016-5423)
* Fix client programs' handling of special characters in database and role names (Noah Misch, Nathan Bossart, Michael Paquier)

  Numerous places in vacuumdb and other client programs could become confused by database and role names containing double quotes or backslashes. Tighten up quoting rules to make that safe. Also, ensure that when a conninfo string is used as a database name parameter to these programs, it is correctly treated as such throughout.

  Fix handling of paired double quotes in psql's \connect and \password commands to match the documentation.

  Introduce a new -reuse-previous option in psql's \connect command to allow explicit control of whether to re-use connection parameters from a previous connection. (Without this, the choice is based on whether the database name looks like a conninfo string, as before.) This allows secure handling of database names containing special characters in pg\_dumpall scripts.

  pg\_dumpall now refuses to deal with database and role names containing carriage returns or newlines, as it seems impractical to quote those characters safely on Windows. In future we may reject such names on the server side, but that step has not been taken yet.

  These are considered security fixes because crafted object names containing special characters could have been used to execute commands with superuser privileges the next time a superuser executes pg\_dumpall or other routine maintenance operations. (CVE-2016-5424)
* Fix corner-case misbehaviors for IS NULL/IS NOT NULL applied to nested composite values (Andrew Gierth, Tom Lane)

  The SQL standard specifies that IS NULL should return TRUE for a row of all null values (thus ROW(NULL,NULL) IS NULL yields TRUE), but this is not meant to apply recursively (thus ROW(NULL, ROW(NULL,NULL)) IS NULL yields FALSE). The core executor got this right, but certain planner optimizations treated the test as recursive (thus producing TRUE in both cases), and contrib/postgres\_fdw could produce remote queries that misbehaved similarly.
* Make the inet and cidr data types properly reject IPv6 addresses with too many colon-separated fields (Tom Lane)
* Prevent crash in `close_ps()` (the point ## lseg operator) for NaN input coordinates (Tom Lane)

  Make it return NULL instead of crashing.
* Avoid possible crash in `pg_get_expr()` when inconsistent values are passed to it (Michael Paquier, Thomas Munro)
* Fix several one-byte buffer over-reads in `to_number()` (Peter Eisentraut)

  In several cases the `to_number()` function would read one more character than it should from the input string. There is a small chance of a crash, if the input happens to be adjacent to the end of memory.
* Do not run the planner on the query contained in CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW or CREATE TABLE AS when WITH NO DATA is specified (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

  This avoids some unnecessary failure conditions, for example if a stable function invoked by the materialized view depends on a table that doesn't exist yet.
* Avoid unsafe intermediate state during expensive paths through `heap_update()` (Masahiko Sawada, Andres Freund)

  Previously, these cases locked the target tuple (by setting its XMAX) but did not WAL-log that action, thus risking data integrity problems if the page were spilled to disk and then a database crash occurred before the tuple update could be completed.
* Fix hint bit update during WAL replay of row locking operations (Andres Freund)

  The only known consequence of this problem is that row locks held by a prepared, but uncommitted, transaction might fail to be enforced after a crash and restart.
* Avoid unnecessary "could not serialize access" errors when acquiring FOR KEY SHARE row locks in serializable mode (Álvaro Herrera)
* Avoid crash in postgres -C when the specified variable has a null string value (Michael Paquier)
* Fix possible loss of large subtransactions in logical decoding (Petru-Florin Mihancea)
* Fix failure of logical decoding when a subtransaction contains no actual changes (Marko Tiikkaja, Andrew Gierth)
* Ensure that backends see up-to-date statistics for shared catalogs (Tom Lane)

  The statistics collector failed to update the statistics file for shared catalogs after a request from a regular backend. This problem was partially masked because the autovacuum launcher regularly makes requests that did cause such updates; however, it became obvious with autovacuum disabled.
* Avoid redundant writes of the statistics files when multiple backends request updates close together (Tom Lane, Tomas Vondra)
* Avoid consuming a transaction ID during VACUUM (Alexander Korotkov)

  Some cases in VACUUM unnecessarily caused an XID to be assigned to the current transaction. Normally this is negligible, but if one is up against the XID wraparound limit, consuming more XIDs during anti-wraparound vacuums is a very bad thing.
* Avoid canceling hot-standby queries during VACUUM FREEZE (Simon Riggs, Álvaro Herrera)

  VACUUM FREEZE on an otherwise-idle master server could result in unnecessary cancellations of queries on its standby servers.
* Prevent possible failure when vacuuming multixact IDs in an installation that has been pg\_upgrade'd from pre-9.3 (Andrew Gierth, Álvaro Herrera)

  The usual symptom of this bug is errors like "MultiXactId NNN has not been created yet -- apparent wraparound".
* When a manual ANALYZE specifies a column list, don't reset the table's changes\_since\_analyze counter (Tom Lane)

  If we're only analyzing some columns, we should not prevent routine auto-analyze from happening for the other columns.
* Fix ANALYZE's overestimation of n\_distinct for a unique or nearly-unique column with many null entries (Tom Lane)

  The nulls could get counted as though they were themselves distinct values, leading to serious planner misestimates in some types of queries.
* Prevent autovacuum from starting multiple workers for the same shared catalog (Álvaro Herrera)

  Normally this isn't much of a problem because the vacuum doesn't take long anyway; but in the case of a severely bloated catalog, it could result in all but one worker uselessly waiting instead of doing useful work on other tables.
* Avoid duplicate buffer lock release when abandoning a b-tree index page deletion attempt (Tom Lane)

  This mistake prevented VACUUM from completing in some cases involving corrupt b-tree indexes.
* Prevent infinite loop in GiST index build for geometric columns containing NaN component values (Tom Lane)
* Fix contrib/btree\_gin to handle the smallest possible bigint value correctly (Peter Eisentraut)
* Teach libpq to correctly decode server version from future servers (Peter Eisentraut)

  It's planned to switch to two-part instead of three-part server version numbers for releases after 9.6. Make sure that `PQserverVersion()` returns the correct value for such cases.
* Fix ecpg's code for unsigned long long array elements (Michael Meskes)
* In pg\_dump with both -c and -C options, avoid emitting an unwanted CREATE SCHEMA public command (David Johnston, Tom Lane)
* Improve handling of SIGTERM/control-C in parallel pg\_dump and pg\_restore (Tom Lane)

  Make sure that the worker processes will exit promptly, and also arrange to send query-cancel requests to the connected backends, in case they are doing something long-running such as a CREATE INDEX.
* Fix error reporting in parallel pg\_dump and pg\_restore (Tom Lane)

  Previously, errors reported by pg\_dump or pg\_restore worker processes might never make it to the user's console, because the messages went through the master process, and there were various deadlock scenarios that would prevent the master process from passing on the messages. Instead, just print everything to stderr. In some cases this will result in duplicate messages (for instance, if all the workers report a server shutdown), but that seems better than no message.
* Ensure that parallel pg\_dump or pg\_restore on Windows will shut down properly after an error (Kyotaro Horiguchi)

  Previously, it would report the error, but then just sit until manually stopped by the user.
* Make pg\_dump behave better when built without zlib support (Kyotaro Horiguchi)

  It didn't work right for parallel dumps, and emitted some rather pointless warnings in other cases.
* Make pg\_basebackup accept -Z 0 as specifying no compression (Fujii Masao)
* Fix makefiles' rule for building AIX shared libraries to be safe for parallel make (Noah Misch)
* Fix TAP tests and MSVC scripts to work when build directory's path name contains spaces (Michael Paquier, Kyotaro Horiguchi)
* Be more predictable about reporting "statement timeout" versus "lock timeout" (Tom Lane)

  On heavily loaded machines, the regression tests sometimes failed due to reporting "lock timeout" even though the statement timeout should have occurred first.
* Make regression tests safe for Danish and Welsh locales (Jeff Janes, Tom Lane)

  Change some test data that triggered the unusual sorting rules of these locales.
* Update our copy of the timezone code to match IANA's tzcode release 2016c (Tom Lane)

  This is needed to cope with anticipated future changes in the time zone data files. It also fixes some corner-case bugs in coping with unusual time zones.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2016f for DST law changes in Kemerovo and Novosibirsk, plus historical corrections for Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Morocco.

## Synopsis

Moderate: rh-postgresql95-postgresql security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2425)

## Topic

An update for rh-postgresql95-postgresql is now available for Red Hat Satellite 5.7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

This update applies only to Satellite 5.7 instances using either embedded or managed PostgreSQL databases.

There are manual steps required in order to finish the migration from postgresql92-postgresql to rh-postgresql95-postgresql. If these steps are not undertaken, the affected Satellite will continue to use PostgreSQL 9.2.

postgresql92-postgresql will be upgraded automatically to rh-postgresql95-postgresql as part of an upgrade to Satellite 5.8.

## Description

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-postgresql95-postgresql (9.5.7). (BZ#1449701)

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL server handled certain SQL statements containing CASE/WHEN commands. A remote, authenticated attacker could use a specially crafted SQL statement to cause PostgreSQL to crash or disclose a few bytes of server memory or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5423)
* A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL client programs handled database and role names containing newlines, carriage returns, double quotes, or backslashes. By crafting such an object name, roles with the CREATEDB or CREATEROLE option could escalate their privileges to superuser when a superuser next executes maintenance with a vulnerable client program. (CVE-2016-5424)
* It was found that some selectivity estimation functions did not check user privileges before providing information from pg\_statistic, possibly leaking information. A non-administrative database user could use this flaw to steal some information from tables they are otherwise not allowed to access. (CVE-2017-7484)
* It was discovered that the PostgreSQL client library (libpq) did not enforce the use of TLS/SSL for a connection to a PostgreSQL server when the PGREQUIRESSL environment variable was set. An man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to strip the SSL/TLS protection from a connection between a client and a server. (CVE-2017-7485)
* It was found that the pg\_user\_mappings view could disclose information about user mappings to a foreign database to non-administrative database users. A database user with USAGE privilege for this mapping could, when querying the view, obtain user mapping data, such as the username and password used to connect to the foreign database. (CVE-2017-7486)

Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Robert Haas as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7484; Daniel Gustafsson as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7485; and Andrew Wheelwright as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7486.

## Solution

As part of this upgrade, PostgreSQL data files will be moved from /opt/rh/postgresql92/root/var/lib/pgsql/ to /var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql95/lib/pgsql/.

Before proceeding with command line portion of the upgrade please insure that there is enough free space under the /var/opt directory. The amount of free space required should be at least equal to size of your /opt/rh/postgresql92/root/var/lib/pgsql/ directory. This size can be determined using the following command:

du -sh /opt/rh/postgresql92/root/var/lib/pgsql/

After updating packages, run following command on your database machine (NOTE: in the embedded-database case this is the Satellite system itself; otherwise, run the command on the system running your PostgreSQL database):

/usr/bin/spacewalk-upgrade-postgresql

postgresql92-postgresql will be upgraded to rh-postgresql95-postgresql.

For details on how to apply this update, refer to:

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# E.12. Release 9.3.14

**Release date:** 2016-08-11

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.3.13. For
information about new features in the 9.3 major release, see
[Section E.26](release-9-3.html).

## E.12.1. Migration to Version 9.3.14

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.3.X.

However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 9.3.9,
see [Section E.17](release-9-3-9.html).

## E.12.2. Changes

* Fix possible mis-evaluation of nested CASE-WHEN expressions
  (Heikki Linnakangas, Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

  A CASE expression appearing within the
  test value subexpression of another CASE
  could become confused about whether its own test value was null or
  not. Also, inlining of a SQL function implementing the equality
  operator used by a CASE expression could
  result in passing the wrong test value to functions called within a
  CASE expression in the SQL function's
  body. If the test values were of different data types, a crash
  might result; moreover such situations could be abused to allow
  disclosure of portions of server memory. (CVE-2016-5423)
* Fix client programs' handling of special characters in database
  and role names (Noah Misch, Nathan Bossart, Michael Paquier)

  Numerous places in vacuumdb and
  other client programs could become confused by database and role
  names containing double quotes or backslashes. Tighten up quoting
  rules to make that safe. Also, ensure that when a conninfo string
  is used as a database name parameter to these programs, it is
  correctly treated as such throughout.

  Fix handling of paired double quotes in psql's \connect and
  \password commands to match the
  documentation.

  Introduce a new -reuse-previous option
  in psql's \connect command to allow explicit control of
  whether to re-use connection parameters from a previous connection.
  (Without this, the choice is based on whether the database name
  looks like a conninfo string, as before.) This allows secure
  handling of database names containing special characters in
  pg\_dumpall scripts.

  pg\_dumpall now refuses to deal
  with database and role names containing carriage returns or
  newlines, as it seems impractical to quote those characters safely
  on Windows. In future we may reject such names on the server side,
  but that step has not been taken yet.

  These are considered security fixes because crafted object names
  containing special characters could have been used to execute
  commands with superuser privileges the next time a superuser
  executes pg\_dumpall or other
  routine maintenance operations. (CVE-2016-5424)
* Fix corner-case misbehaviors for IS
  NULL/IS NOT NULL applied to nested
  composite values (Andrew Gierth, Tom Lane)

  The SQL standard specifies that IS NULL
  should return TRUE for a row of all null values (thus ROW(NULL,NULL) IS NULL yields TRUE), but this is not
  meant to apply recursively (thus ROW(NULL,
  ROW(NULL,NULL)) IS NULL yields FALSE). The core executor got
  this right, but certain planner optimizations treated the test as
  recursive (thus producing TRUE in both cases), and contrib/postgres\_fdw could produce remote queries
  that misbehaved similarly.
* Make the inet and cidr data types properly reject IPv6 addresses with too
  many colon-separated fields (Tom Lane)
* Prevent crash in `close_ps()` (the
  point ## lseg operator) for NaN input coordinates (Tom Lane)

  Make it return NULL instead of crashing.
* Avoid possible crash in `pg_get_expr()` when inconsistent values are passed
  to it (Michael Paquier, Thomas Munro)
* Fix several one-byte buffer over-reads in `to_number()` (Peter Eisentraut)

  In several cases the `to_number()`
  function would read one more character than it should from the
  input string. There is a small chance of a crash, if the input
  happens to be adjacent to the end of memory.
* Do not run the planner on the query contained in CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW or CREATE TABLE AS when WITH NO
  DATA is specified (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

  This avoids some unnecessary failure conditions, for example if
  a stable function invoked by the materialized view depends on a
  table that doesn't exist yet.
* Avoid unsafe intermediate state during expensive paths through
  `heap_update()` (Masahiko Sawada,
  Andres Freund)

  Previously, these cases locked the target tuple (by setting its
  XMAX) but did not WAL-log that action, thus risking data integrity
  problems if the page were spilled to disk and then a database crash
  occurred before the tuple update could be completed.
* Fix hint bit update during WAL replay of row locking operations
  (Andres Freund)

  The only known consequence of this problem is that row locks
  held by a prepared, but uncommitted, transaction might fail to be
  enforced after a crash and restart.
* Avoid unnecessary "could not serialize
  access" errors when acquiring FOR KEY
  SHARE row locks in serializable mode (Álvaro Herrera)
* Avoid crash in postgres -C when the
  specified variable has a null string value (Michael Paquier)
* Ensure that backends see up-to-date statistics for shared
  catalogs (Tom Lane)

  The statistics collector failed to update the statistics file
  for shared catalogs after a request from a regular backend. This
  problem was partially masked because the autovacuum launcher
  regularly makes requests that did cause such updates; however, it
  became obvious with autovacuum disabled.
* Avoid redundant writes of the statistics files when multiple
  backends request updates close together (Tom Lane, Tomas
  Vondra)
* Avoid consuming a transaction ID during VACUUM (Alexander Korotkov)

  Some cases in VACUUM unnecessarily
  caused an XID to be assigned to the current transaction. Normally
  this is negligible, but if one is up against the XID wraparound
  limit, consuming more XIDs during anti-wraparound vacuums is a very
  bad thing.
* Avoid canceling hot-standby queries during VACUUM FREEZE (Simon Riggs, Álvaro Herrera)

  VACUUM FREEZE on an otherwise-idle
  master server could result in unnecessary cancellations of queries
  on its standby servers.
* Prevent possible failure when vacuuming multixact IDs in an
  installation that has been pg\_upgrade'd from pre-9.3 (Andrew
  Gierth, Álvaro Herrera)

  The usual symptom of this bug is errors like "MultiXactId NNN has not
  been created yet -- apparent wraparound".
* When a manual ANALYZE specifies a
  column list, don't reset the table's changes\_since\_analyze counter (Tom Lane)

  If we're only analyzing some columns, we should not prevent
  routine auto-analyze from happening for the other columns.
* Fix ANALYZE's overestimation of
  n\_distinct for a unique or nearly-unique
  column with many null entries (Tom Lane)

  The nulls could get counted as though they were themselves
  distinct values, leading to serious planner misestimates in some
  types of queries.
* Prevent autovacuum from starting multiple workers for the same
  shared catalog (Álvaro Herrera)

  Normally this isn't much of a problem because the vacuum doesn't
  take long anyway; but in the case of a severely bloated catalog, it
  could result in all but one worker uselessly waiting instead of
  doing useful work on other tables.
* Prevent infinite loop in GiST index build for geometric columns
  containing NaN component values (Tom Lane)
* Fix contrib/btree\_gin to handle the
  smallest possible bigint value correctly
  (Peter Eisentraut)
* Teach libpq to correctly decode server version from future
  servers (Peter Eisentraut)

  It's planned to switch to two-part instead of three-part server
  version numbers for releases after 9.6. Make sure that `PQserverVersion()` returns the correct value for
  such cases.
* Fix ecpg's code for unsigned long long array elements (Michael
  Meskes)
* In pg\_dump with both -c and -C options, avoid
  emitting an unwanted CREATE SCHEMA public
  command (David Johnston, Tom Lane)
* Improve handling of SIGTERM/control-C in parallel pg\_dump and pg\_restore (Tom Lane)

  Make sure that the worker processes will exit promptly, and also
  arrange to send query-cancel requests to the connected backends, in
  case they are doing something long-running such as a CREATE INDEX.
* Fix error reporting in parallel pg\_dump and pg\_restore (Tom Lane)

  Previously, errors reported by pg\_dump or pg\_restore worker processes might never make
  it to the user's console, because the messages went through the
  master process, and there were various deadlock scenarios that
  would prevent the master process from passing on the messages.
  Instead, just print everything to stderr.
  In some cases this will result in duplicate messages (for instance,
  if all the workers report a server shutdown), but that seems better
  than no message.
* Ensure that parallel pg\_dump or
  pg\_restore on Windows will shut
  down properly after an error (Kyotaro Horiguchi)

  Previously, it would report the error, but then just sit until
  manually stopped by the user.
* Make pg\_dump behave better when
  built without zlib support (Kyotaro Horiguchi)

  It didn't work right for parallel dumps, and emitted some rather
  pointless warnings in other cases.
* Make pg\_basebackup accept
  -Z 0 as specifying no compression (Fujii
  Masao)
* Fix makefiles' rule for building AIX shared libraries to be safe
  for parallel make (Noah Misch)
* Fix TAP tests and MSVC scripts to work when build directory's
  path name contains spaces (Michael Paquier, Kyotaro Horiguchi)
* Be more predictable about reporting "statement timeout" versus "lock
  timeout" (Tom Lane)

  On heavily loaded machines, the regression tests sometimes
  failed due to reporting "lock timeout"
  even though the statement timeout should have occurred first.
* Make regression tests safe for Danish and Welsh locales (Jeff
  Janes, Tom Lane)

  Change some test data that triggered the unusual sorting rules
  of these locales.
* Update our copy of the timezone code to match IANA's
  tzcode release 2016c (Tom
  Lane)

  This is needed to cope with anticipated future changes in the
  time zone data files. It also fixes some corner-case bugs in coping
  with unusual time zones.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2016f for DST law changes in
  Kemerovo and Novosibirsk, plus historical corrections for
  Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Morocco.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

Before installing an update, make sure all previously released errata relevant to the system have been applied.

To access updates when using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, launch the graphical update tool through **Applications** and then **Software** which is visible in the Favorites dock (by default).

```
# gnome-software

```

Within the graphical interface, select **Updates**.

For a command line interface, use the following command to update the operating system:

```
# dnf upgrade

```

To install a specific package, such as vsftpd, use the following command:

```
# dnf install vsftpd

```

To update a specific package, such as bind, use the following command:

```
# dnf upgrade bind

```

To find more information about the command line options available for `yum`, use the following command:

## Topic

An update for rh-postgresql95-postgresql is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: rh-postgresql95-postgresql (9.5.4)

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL server handled certain SQL statements containing CASE/WHEN commands. A remote, authenticated attacker could use a specially crafted SQL statement to cause PostgreSQL to crash or disclose a few bytes of server memory or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5423)
* A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL client programs handled database and role names containing newlines, carriage returns, double quotes, or backslashes. By crafting such an object name, roles with the CREATEDB or CREATEROLE option could escalate their privileges to superuser when a superuser next executes maintenance with a vulnerable client program. (CVE-2016-5424)

Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Heikki Linnakangas as the original reporter of CVE-2016-5423; and Nathan Bossart as the original reporter of CVE-2016-5424.

## Solution

# E.2. Release 9.1.23

> **Release Date:** 2016-08-11

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.1.22. For
information about new features in the 9.1 major release, see
[Section E.25](release-9-1.html).

The PostgreSQL community will
stop releasing updates for the 9.1.X release series in September
2016. Users are encouraged to update to a newer release branch
soon.

## E.2.1. Migration to Version 9.1.23

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.1.X.

However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than
9.1.16, see [Section E.9](release-9-1-16.html).

## E.2.2. Changes

* Fix possible mis-evaluation of nested CASE-WHEN
  expressions (Heikki Linnakangas, Michael Paquier, Tom
  Lane)

  A CASE expression appearing
  within the test value subexpression of another CASE could become confused about whether its
  own test value was null or not. Also, inlining of a SQL
  function implementing the equality operator used by a
  CASE expression could result in
  passing the wrong test value to functions called within a
  CASE expression in the SQL
  function's body. If the test values were of different data
  types, a crash might result; moreover such situations could
  be abused to allow disclosure of portions of server memory.
  (CVE-2016-5423)
* Fix client programs' handling of special characters in
  database and role names (Noah Misch, Nathan Bossart,
  Michael Paquier)

  Numerous places in vacuumdb and other client programs
  could become confused by database and role names containing
  double quotes or backslashes. Tighten up quoting rules to
  make that safe. Also, ensure that when a conninfo string is
  used as a database name parameter to these programs, it is
  correctly treated as such throughout.

  Fix handling of paired double quotes in psql's \connect and \password commands to match the
  documentation.

  Introduce a new -reuse-previous
  option in psql's
  \connect command to allow explicit
  control of whether to re-use connection parameters from a
  previous connection. (Without this, the choice is based on
  whether the database name looks like a conninfo string, as
  before.) This allows secure handling of database names
  containing special characters in pg\_dumpall scripts.

  pg\_dumpall now refuses
  to deal with database and role names containing carriage
  returns or newlines, as it seems impractical to quote those
  characters safely on Windows. In future we may reject such
  names on the server side, but that step has not been taken
  yet.

  These are considered security fixes because crafted
  object names containing special characters could have been
  used to execute commands with superuser privileges the next
  time a superuser executes pg\_dumpall or other routine
  maintenance operations. (CVE-2016-5424)
* Fix corner-case misbehaviors for IS
  NULL/IS NOT NULL applied to
  nested composite values (Andrew Gierth, Tom Lane)

  The SQL standard specifies that IS
  NULL should return TRUE for a row of all null values
  (thus ROW(NULL,NULL) IS NULL
  yields TRUE), but this is not meant to apply recursively
  (thus ROW(NULL, ROW(NULL,NULL)) IS
  NULL yields FALSE). The core executor got this right,
  but certain planner optimizations treated the test as
  recursive (thus producing TRUE in both cases), and
  contrib/postgres\_fdw could
  produce remote queries that misbehaved similarly.
* Make the inet and cidr data types properly reject IPv6 addresses
  with too many colon-separated fields (Tom Lane)
* Prevent crash in `close_ps()` (the point ## lseg operator) for NaN input coordinates (Tom
  Lane)

  Make it return NULL instead of crashing.
* Fix several one-byte buffer over-reads in `to_number()` (Peter Eisentraut)

  In several cases the `to_number()` function would read one more
  character than it should from the input string. There is a
  small chance of a crash, if the input happens to be
  adjacent to the end of memory.
* Avoid unsafe intermediate state during expensive paths
  through `heap_update()`
  (Masahiko Sawada, Andres Freund)

  Previously, these cases locked the target tuple (by
  setting its XMAX) but did not WAL-log that action, thus
  risking data integrity problems if the page were spilled to
  disk and then a database crash occurred before the tuple
  update could be completed.
* Avoid consuming a transaction ID during VACUUM (Alexander Korotkov)

  Some cases in VACUUM
  unnecessarily caused an XID to be assigned to the current
  transaction. Normally this is negligible, but if one is up
  against the XID wraparound limit, consuming more XIDs
  during anti-wraparound vacuums is a very bad thing.
* Avoid canceling hot-standby queries during VACUUM FREEZE (Simon Riggs, Álvaro
  Herrera)

  VACUUM FREEZE on an
  otherwise-idle master server could result in unnecessary
  cancellations of queries on its standby servers.
* When a manual ANALYZE specifies
  a column list, don't reset the table's changes\_since\_analyze counter (Tom Lane)

  If we're only analyzing some columns, we should not
  prevent routine auto-analyze from happening for the other
  columns.
* Fix ANALYZE's overestimation of
  n\_distinct for a unique or
  nearly-unique column with many null entries (Tom Lane)

  The nulls could get counted as though they were
  themselves distinct values, leading to serious planner
  misestimates in some types of queries.
* Prevent autovacuum from starting multiple workers for
  the same shared catalog (Álvaro Herrera)

  Normally this isn't much of a problem because the vacuum
  doesn't take long anyway; but in the case of a severely
  bloated catalog, it could result in all but one worker
  uselessly waiting instead of doing useful work on other
  tables.
* Fix contrib/btree\_gin to
  handle the smallest possible bigint
  value correctly (Peter Eisentraut)
* Teach libpq to correctly decode server version from
  future servers (Peter Eisentraut)

  It's planned to switch to two-part instead of three-part
  server version numbers for releases after 9.6. Make sure
  that `PQserverVersion()`
  returns the correct value for such cases.
* Fix ecpg's code for
  unsigned long long array elements
  (Michael Meskes)
* Make pg\_basebackup
  accept -Z 0 as specifying no
  compression (Fujii Masao)
* Revert to the old heuristic timeout for pg\_ctl start -w (Tom Lane)

  The new method adopted as of release 9.1.20 does not
  work when silent\_mode is enabled,
  so go back to the old way.
* Fix makefiles' rule for building AIX shared libraries to
  be safe for parallel make (Noah Misch)
* Fix TAP tests and MSVC scripts to work when build
  directory's path name contains spaces (Michael Paquier,
  Kyotaro Horiguchi)
* Make regression tests safe for Danish and Welsh locales
  (Jeff Janes, Tom Lane)

  Change some test data that triggered the unusual sorting
  rules of these locales.
* Update our copy of the timezone code to match IANA's
  tzcode release 2016c (Tom
  Lane)

  This is needed to cope with anticipated future changes
  in the time zone data files. It also fixes some corner-case
  bugs in coping with unusual time zones.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2016f for DST law
  changes in Kemerovo and Novosibirsk, plus historical
  corrections for Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Morocco.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1364002#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-04 09:10:29 UTC  ``` It was found that PostgreSQL client programs mishandle database and role names containing newlines, carriage returns, double quotes, or backslashes. By crafting such an object name, roles with the CREATEDB or CREATEROLE option could escalate their privileges to superuser when a superuser next executes maintenance with a vulnerable program. Vulnerable programs include pg_dumpall, pg_upgrade, vacuumdb, reindexdb, and clusterdb.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1364002#c1)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-04 09:10:47 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the PostgreSQL project Upstream: Nathan Bossart   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1364002#c2)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-11 17:25:48 UTC  ``` Public via:  <https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1688/>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1364002#c3)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-11 17:33:23 UTC  ```  Created postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1366346](show_bug.cgi?id=1366346 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-5424 postgresql: privilege escalation via crafted database and role names [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1364002#c4)  Martin Prpič    2016-08-11 17:34:20 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=fcd15f13581f6d75c63d213220d5a94889206c1b>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1364002#c14)  Fedora Update System    2016-08-23 12:49:33 UTC  ``` postgresql-9.5.4-1.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository.

## Topic

An update for rh-postgresql94-postgresql is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: rh-postgresql94-postgresql (9.4.9)

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL server handled certain SQL statements containing CASE/WHEN commands. A remote, authenticated attacker could use a specially crafted SQL statement to cause PostgreSQL to crash or disclose a few bytes of server memory or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5423)
* A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL client programs handled database and role names containing newlines, carriage returns, double quotes, or backslashes. By crafting such an object name, roles with the CREATEDB or CREATEROLE option could escalate their privileges to superuser when a superuser next executes maintenance with a vulnerable client program. (CVE-2016-5424)

Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Heikki Linnakangas as the original reporter of CVE-2016-5423; and Nathan Bossart as the original reporter of CVE-2016-5424.

## Solution

# E.7. Release 9.2.18

**Release date:** 2016-08-11

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.2.17. For
information about new features in the 9.2 major release, see
[Section E.25](release-9-2.html).

## E.7.1. Migration to Version 9.2.18

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.2.X.

However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than
9.2.11, see [Section E.14](release-9-2-11.html).

## E.7.2. Changes

* Fix possible mis-evaluation of nested CASE-WHEN
  expressions (Heikki Linnakangas, Michael Paquier, Tom
  Lane)

  A CASE expression appearing
  within the test value subexpression of another CASE could become confused about whether its
  own test value was null or not. Also, inlining of a SQL
  function implementing the equality operator used by a
  CASE expression could result in
  passing the wrong test value to functions called within a
  CASE expression in the SQL
  function's body. If the test values were of different data
  types, a crash might result; moreover such situations could
  be abused to allow disclosure of portions of server memory.
  (CVE-2016-5423)
* Fix client programs' handling of special characters in
  database and role names (Noah Misch, Nathan Bossart,
  Michael Paquier)

  Numerous places in vacuumdb and other client programs
  could become confused by database and role names containing
  double quotes or backslashes. Tighten up quoting rules to
  make that safe. Also, ensure that when a conninfo string is
  used as a database name parameter to these programs, it is
  correctly treated as such throughout.

  Fix handling of paired double quotes in psql's \connect and \password commands to match the
  documentation.

  Introduce a new -reuse-previous
  option in psql's
  \connect command to allow explicit
  control of whether to re-use connection parameters from a
  previous connection. (Without this, the choice is based on
  whether the database name looks like a conninfo string, as
  before.) This allows secure handling of database names
  containing special characters in pg\_dumpall scripts.

  pg\_dumpall now refuses
  to deal with database and role names containing carriage
  returns or newlines, as it seems impractical to quote those
  characters safely on Windows. In future we may reject such
  names on the server side, but that step has not been taken
  yet.

  These are considered security fixes because crafted
  object names containing special characters could have been
  used to execute commands with superuser privileges the next
  time a superuser executes pg\_dumpall or other routine
  maintenance operations. (CVE-2016-5424)
* Fix corner-case misbehaviors for IS
  NULL/IS NOT NULL applied to
  nested composite values (Andrew Gierth, Tom Lane)

  The SQL standard specifies that IS
  NULL should return TRUE for a row of all null values
  (thus ROW(NULL,NULL) IS NULL
  yields TRUE), but this is not meant to apply recursively
  (thus ROW(NULL, ROW(NULL,NULL)) IS
  NULL yields FALSE). The core executor got this right,
  but certain planner optimizations treated the test as
  recursive (thus producing TRUE in both cases), and
  contrib/postgres\_fdw could
  produce remote queries that misbehaved similarly.
* Make the inet and cidr data types properly reject IPv6 addresses
  with too many colon-separated fields (Tom Lane)
* Prevent crash in `close_ps()` (the point ## lseg operator) for NaN input coordinates (Tom
  Lane)

  Make it return NULL instead of crashing.
* Fix several one-byte buffer over-reads in `to_number()` (Peter Eisentraut)

  In several cases the `to_number()` function would read one more
  character than it should from the input string. There is a
  small chance of a crash, if the input happens to be
  adjacent to the end of memory.
* Avoid unsafe intermediate state during expensive paths
  through `heap_update()`
  (Masahiko Sawada, Andres Freund)

  Previously, these cases locked the target tuple (by
  setting its XMAX) but did not WAL-log that action, thus
  risking data integrity problems if the page were spilled to
  disk and then a database crash occurred before the tuple
  update could be completed.
* Avoid crash in postgres -C when
  the specified variable has a null string value (Michael
  Paquier)
* Avoid consuming a transaction ID during VACUUM (Alexander Korotkov)

  Some cases in VACUUM
  unnecessarily caused an XID to be assigned to the current
  transaction. Normally this is negligible, but if one is up
  against the XID wraparound limit, consuming more XIDs
  during anti-wraparound vacuums is a very bad thing.
* Avoid canceling hot-standby queries during VACUUM FREEZE (Simon Riggs, Álvaro
  Herrera)

  VACUUM FREEZE on an
  otherwise-idle master server could result in unnecessary
  cancellations of queries on its standby servers.
* When a manual ANALYZE specifies
  a column list, don't reset the table's changes\_since\_analyze counter (Tom Lane)

  If we're only analyzing some columns, we should not
  prevent routine auto-analyze from happening for the other
  columns.
* Fix ANALYZE's overestimation of
  n\_distinct for a unique or
  nearly-unique column with many null entries (Tom Lane)

  The nulls could get counted as though they were
  themselves distinct values, leading to serious planner
  misestimates in some types of queries.
* Prevent autovacuum from starting multiple workers for
  the same shared catalog (Álvaro Herrera)

  Normally this isn't much of a problem because the vacuum
  doesn't take long anyway; but in the case of a severely
  bloated catalog, it could result in all but one worker
  uselessly waiting instead of doing useful work on other
  tables.
* Prevent infinite loop in GiST index build for geometric
  columns containing NaN component values (Tom Lane)
* Fix contrib/btree\_gin to
  handle the smallest possible bigint
  value correctly (Peter Eisentraut)
* Teach libpq to correctly decode server version from
  future servers (Peter Eisentraut)

  It's planned to switch to two-part instead of three-part
  server version numbers for releases after 9.6. Make sure
  that `PQserverVersion()`
  returns the correct value for such cases.
* Fix ecpg's code for
  unsigned long long array elements
  (Michael Meskes)
* In pg\_dump with both
  -c and -C
  options, avoid emitting an unwanted CREATE SCHEMA public command (David
  Johnston, Tom Lane)
* Make pg\_basebackup
  accept -Z 0 as specifying no
  compression (Fujii Masao)
* Fix makefiles' rule for building AIX shared libraries to
  be safe for parallel make (Noah Misch)
* Fix TAP tests and MSVC scripts to work when build
  directory's path name contains spaces (Michael Paquier,
  Kyotaro Horiguchi)
* Make regression tests safe for Danish and Welsh locales
  (Jeff Janes, Tom Lane)

  Change some test data that triggered the unusual sorting
  rules of these locales.
* Update our copy of the timezone code to match IANA's
  tzcode release 2016c (Tom
  Lane)

  This is needed to cope with anticipated future changes
  in the time zone data files. It also fixes some corner-case
  bugs in coping with unusual time zones.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2016f for DST law
  changes in Kemerovo and Novosibirsk, plus historical
  corrections for Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Morocco.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
