Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-5287:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) condition that occurs during the destruction of an actor related to service workers. Specifically, it involves a race condition where the `FileDescriptorSetChild` actor's `ForgetFileDescriptors` method is called *after* the actor itself has been deleted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a UAF. The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This leads to memory corruption and potential crashes.
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability stems from a race condition between the destruction of the actor and the call to the `ForgetFileDescriptors` method. The destruction can occur due to `Send__delete__()` being called.
*   **Incorrect Ordering:** The core issue is an incorrect ordering of operations. The `ForgetFileDescriptors` method should be called *before* the actor is destroyed, not after.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Impact:** The primary impact is a crash, but it's a potentially exploitable crash that can be triggered remotely by an attacker.
*   **Code Execution Potential**: Although not explicitly stated, UAF vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution by a malicious actor.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The crash can lead to denial-of-service, especially if it occurs frequently.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Service Workers:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of service workers in the browser.
*   **Web Content:** Malicious web content can be crafted to trigger the UAF through service worker interactions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server:** An attacker needs to control a web server that serves the malicious content.
*   **Service Worker Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of service worker APIs and how to manipulate them to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction**: The user must navigate to the malicious website.

**Technical Details:**

*   The crash occurs within the `nsTArray_base<T>::SwapArrayElements<T>` method. This suggests the use-after-free happens within the array manipulation during the destruction of `FileDescriptorSetChild` or `FileDescriptorSetParent`.
*   The fix involves reordering the code so that `fdSetActor->ForgetFileDescriptors(fds);` is called *before* `Unused << fdSetActor->Send__delete__(fdSetActor);`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in Firefox 49 with the implementation of cross-process pipes (bug 1093357).
*   The issue was classified as "sec-high" which is a high severity vulnerability and the fix was backported to Firefox 49, 50, 51 and 52.
*   The bug report includes a small exploit example written in python that can be used to trigger the crash using a malicious webpage.
