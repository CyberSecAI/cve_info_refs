Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-5008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how libvirt handles an empty string when setting a VNC password. Instead of disabling access as documented, an empty string results in no authentication being required for VNC connections, effectively bypassing the intended password protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the authentication bypass. Setting the VNC password to an empty string, which should disable authentication, instead allows anyone to connect without any password validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the VNC console of a virtual machine. This access could lead to further compromise of the guest operating system or data exfiltration.
*  **Lack of Authentication:** The VNC server, configured with an empty password, does not enforce authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the VNC port of the target virtual machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the VNC port of the vulnerable virtual machine.
*   **No Credentials Required:** No username or password is required by an attacker when attempting to connect to the vulnerable VNC endpoint, as long as it has an empty string configured as password.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   **libvirt behavior:** When using the set_password QMP command, `password=""` is treated as an empty string password instead of disabling authentication
*   **qemu behavior:** setting the password to empty with the `-vnc` option disables authentication. The `change vnc ""` monitor command does the same
*   **spice behavior**: `password=""` shows a password prompt but won't accept any password. This effectively blocks access when configured.
*   **Root Cause Code change:** libvirt uses `set_password` QMP command for configuring the VNC password. However the `set_password` command deliberately does _not_ have the documented semantics for VNC: password="" is treated as an empty string password.
*  **Solution:**  The fix enforces the intended behavior by setting the password expiration to "now" when the password is set to empty. This makes the VNC server require authentication and prevents connection attempts if no password is provided.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is also present in Spice connections, but the effect is to prevent any connection rather than allowing anonymous access, which has different implications.
*   The fix to this CVE was backported to multiple versions of the libvirt library.

This summary combines information from various sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability. The information from the Red Hat Security Advisory, openSUSE mailing lists, Launchpad page, and bugzilla entries all confirm the vulnerability and the fix that was applied. The core issue lies in inconsistent handling of an empty password string in the libvirt library's VNC implementation, where it would not disable authentication as expected.
