- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The session token is transmitted in plaintext within the HTTP header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unencrypted transmission of session tokens in HTTP headers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can capture the plaintext session tokens and use them to launch replay attacks, leading to information leakage, damage to the product's integrity, and disruption of availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access is required to capture network traffic and extract the session tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned on the network to sniff traffic and capture packets containing the session tokens.
