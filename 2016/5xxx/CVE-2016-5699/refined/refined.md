  "summary": "The Python httplib library did not properly check HTTPConnection.putheader() function arguments, allowing an attacker to inject additional headers in a Python application that allowed user provided header names or values.",
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "The httplib library in Python did not perform adequate validation of arguments passed to the HTTPConnection.putheader() function.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "HTTP header injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into a Python application that uses the vulnerable httplib library.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker could inject additional headers via crafted user-provided header names or values to an application using the Python's httplib library.",
         "HTTP requests"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control or influence header names or values that are processed by a Python application using the httplib library.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability lies within the httplib library, specifically in how it handles arguments for the HTTPConnection.putheader() function. This library is used by urllib, urllib2 and others. An attacker could exploit this by injecting additional headers, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure."
