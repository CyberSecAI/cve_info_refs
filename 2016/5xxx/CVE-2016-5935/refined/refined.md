- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of certificate verification when connecting to remote datastores from WebSphere Admin Console in federation scenarios. The system fails to properly validate the SSL certificate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient SSL certificate validation during communication with remote datastores.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could obtain sensitive information by exploiting the lack of SSL certificate validation, possibly through man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, leveraging man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable system and remote datastores. The attacker does not require any privileges on the target system.
