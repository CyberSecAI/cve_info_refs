  "CVE-2016-5300": {
    "Description": "The XML parser in Expat does not use sufficient entropy for hash initialization, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted identifiers in an XML document. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0876.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient entropy for hash initialization in the XML parser.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient entropy",
       "Incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0876"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (CPU consumption)",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted identifiers in an XML document"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Context-dependent attacker"
