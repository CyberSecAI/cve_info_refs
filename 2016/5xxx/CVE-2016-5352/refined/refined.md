Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5352:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `AirPDcapDecryptWPABroadcastKey` function of the Wireshark IEEE 802.11 dissector. This is caused by insufficient validation of the `eapol_len` value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based out-of-bounds read. Specifically, the code was not properly checking if `eapol_len` was large enough before calculating the key length. If `eapol_len` was smaller than `sizeof(EAPOL_RSN_KEY)`, the key length calculation could result in a large positive value and an out-of-bounds read when accessing `pEAPKey`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can cause Wireshark to crash. An attacker can trigger this crash by crafting a malformed 802.11 packet and either injecting it onto the network or by convincing a user to open a malicious packet capture file.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malformed 802.11 packets.
- Malicious packet capture files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to either inject a malicious packet onto a network being monitored by Wireshark or the ability to convince a Wireshark user to open a malicious capture file.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves a sanity check on the `eapol_len` value to ensure it's large enough to contain the EAPOL RSN key.
- The vulnerable code is in `epan/crypt/airpdcap.c`.
- This vulnerability is addressed in Wireshark version 2.0.4.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk.
