## Workarounds and Mitigations

The following remediation instructions will remove the vulnerability without side-effects. The user executing the commands must be root and the instructions must be repeated for each DB2 instance and in the DB2 install directory.

The following example will use /home/db2inst1/sqllib as the DB2 instance install directory. You should replace the sample directory with your DB2 instance install directory. Repeat the procedure with the DB2 install directory which is under /opt/ibm/db2/<db2\_release\_name> or /opt/IBM/db2/<db2\_release\_name>, depending on the platform.

The following will fix the install component that exists at the DB2 client and server.

cd /home/db2inst1/sqllib

bin/db2chglibpath -s '\.:' -r '' adm/db2iclean
