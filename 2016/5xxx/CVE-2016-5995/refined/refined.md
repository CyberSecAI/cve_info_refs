Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-5995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from IBM DB2 loading libraries from insecure locations. This allows a local user to exploit the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure library loading practices. DB2 was vulnerable to loading libraries from locations writable by local users.
- Privilege escalation due to the execution of SETGID or SETUID binaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a local user to gain root level access. This means complete control over the system, including data access and modification, service disruption, and potentially further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker. A malicious actor needs local access to the vulnerable system.
- Placing a malicious library in an insecure location. This involves crafting a library that, when loaded by a vulnerable DB2 component, allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local user access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious library in a specific location that DB2 will attempt to load from.

**Summary:**
CVE-2016-5995 describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability in IBM DB2 due to insecure library loading. A local user can exploit this by placing a malicious library in a vulnerable path, allowing them to gain root privileges when a SETUID/SETGID binary attempts to load it.
