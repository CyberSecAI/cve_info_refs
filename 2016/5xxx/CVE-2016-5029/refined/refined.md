  "cveId": "CVE-2016-5029",
  "date": "2016-05-22",
  "vulnerability": "Null dereference in create_fullest_file_path().",
  "affectedProduct": "libdwarf",
  "description": "The null dereference in create_fullest_file_path() causes a crash. This is due to corrupted dwarf and the fix detects this corruption and if that null string pointer happens undetected a static string is substituted so readers can notice the situation.",
  "rootCause": "A null string pointer in `line_context->lc_include_directories` is dereferenced using `strlen()`. This can occur when the DWARF data is corrupted and includes an invalid directory index.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of corrupted DWARF data",
    "NULL pointer dereference"
  ],
   "impact": "The vulnerability results in a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition. The vulnerability can be triggered by a corrupted DWARF file, which could be caused by a malicious actor.",
  "attackVector": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted ELF file with a corrupted DWARF section containing an invalid directory index in the line number information.",
  "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted ELF file to the vulnerable software (libdwarf/dwarfdump). The attacker must have the ability to create a malformed DWARF file that causes a null pointer to be dereferenced."
