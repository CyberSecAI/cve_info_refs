See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.82 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Firefox Version: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
1. Download the poc.zip file
2. Put the p.url file into the Path 'C:/'
3. Open the spoof.html, click the 'sumbit' button, wait and reproduce this issue.
spoof.html:
<form action="file://127.0.0.1/c:/p.url" target="xx" method="post" onsubmit="setTimeout(k, 2020)" id="c">
<input type="submit">a</input>
</form>
<script>
function k(){
window.open("ja vascript:document.writeln('Spoof Google.com<img src=# onerror=alert(location.href)>!!')","xx");
}
</script>
You could find more details by watching PoC.mp4 and watch PoC.png
Actual results:
The attacker could spoof and inject javascript code into any web pages. In the PoC, you could find the google.com is spoofed and the same-origin police has been bypassed.
Expected results:
Never change the address bar and navigation utill the page has been full loaded.

If you have to convince a user to download a file to a specific path that the website then needs knowledge of to get to a spoof, that feels like it's very hard to exploit. If you can direct the user to download a particular file to a particular location, it feels like that would enable you to do more severe things than spoof the location bar. In other words, I'm not really sure about the severity here.
In fact, does this work if spoof.html is hosted on http? The screenshot shows it on file:///. I would expect it to only work if hosted locally, because the POST to file:/// is presumably not allowed. And if that \*is\* allowed, that feels much more like a docnav issue to me than something to do with the location bar.

As written, I don't believe this helps (and it has other downsides both from a UX and security perspective). AIUI, it is possible for the testcase to work even if google.com loads fully - in fact, if location.href has been updated to reflect google.com, it \*is\* loaded (at least to some degree - waiting for extra images or stylesheets or whatever won't make a difference here).
Instead, the location bar should be updating when the JS runs, though I'd argue that the JS shouldn't be running against the other window at all, because it shouldn't have the same principal as the file-linked-to-google.com document. That's a Core issue, and it wouldn't go away by just not updating the location bar.
Boris, I would expect that we get notified (like through nsIWebProgressListener) when the JS runs here somehow. As noted, I also think the JS shouldn't be running at all, and the fact that it does is a Core issue that needs to be addressed. Am I missing something?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Also pulling in Christoph because of the ... interesting... similarities with [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss"). Which is fixed for 48. Not sure why it's not helping here.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

There is nothing preventing POST to a file:/// URL that I know of. It just gets turned into a GET, with the postdata dropped on the floor.
This does in fact look like [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") to me. And at least on Mac if I try the attached testcase (replacing the .url file with an equivalent .desktop file) I don't see the JS running or the spoof working.
I assume the problem \_is\_ reproducible on Windows? If so, I'd really appreciate it if someone who has easy access to a Windows debug build could check what things look like in nsJSProtocolHandler.cpp, in the nsJSThunk::EvaluateScript, around the principal->Subsumes(objectPrincipal) call. What are principal and objectPrincipal in this case?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

The patch for [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") is using "^" and not "&~" to remove the security-inheritance bit? Which means it might be \_adding\_ it in this case in some situations? That could explain what's going on, if so... :(
Gijs, if you change
nsSecurityFlags secFlags = mLoadInfo->GetSecurityFlags() ^
nsILoadInfo::SEC\_FORCE\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL;
to:
nsSecurityFlags secFlags = mLoadInfo->GetSecurityFlags() &
~nsILoadInfo::SEC\_FORCE\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL;
in nsBaseChannel::Redirect, does that fix the problem?

With this change, AFAICT the JS no longer runs. It's hard to be 100% sure because of the timeout, which means the testcase feels like it'll be a bit racy, but actually it's 100% reproducible for me on beta, and 0% reproducible after this change, when testing on self-compiled nightly. So I suspect you're right. Please needinfo if it'd be helpful for me to poke at this more (e.g. stacks for how we're hitting this case for this exploit) and I'll try and answer any questions tomorrow if that's helpful.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

OK, I thought about it more, and I can reproduce this bug on Mac too. All I have to do is make sure that p.desktop is in the \_parent\_ of the directory that houses spoof.html, so that normally the load of p.desktop would \_not\_ inherit the principal. The use of xor instead of &~ means the inherit bit gets added in that situation...

Be more careful about removing the inherit principal bit on base channel redirects
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Good question. Probably pretty easily if you know how this codepath is hit and how our file security model works.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not as far as I could avoid. I did explicitly talk about removing the bit, but I assume anyone who sees fooo & ~bar will know that anyway.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
45esr, 48, 49, 50, 51.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This should be a trivial backport.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
This seems pretty safe to me. Minimal testing is probably OK.

Daniel, note that this bug basically allows file:// stuff to violate our security model for file://. Place a .url/.desktop file in a dir pointing to an arbitrary file, have a file in a \_child\_ of that dir that links to that .url/.desktop, load that file from the child dir, and suddenly you are same-origin with the arbitrary file the .url/.desktop links to.
So it may be worth taking this in a security update to 48, unless there simply isn't time for one before 49 ships anyway.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

[User impact if declined]: Allows files to attack other files on the hard drive
in ways they shouldn't be able to do, in addition to creating spoofing risks.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: Test coverage is lacking for
file:// stuff.
[Risks and why]: I think this is pretty low risk, but since this is a regression

Generally sec-high or sec-critical unless a special case is made. We don't take moderate or low rated issues on the ESR branch normally for stability reasons.

Dan is the one who rated it sec-moderate so you would need to ask him why it isn't a high if you think it is misrated. Otherwise, policy is that we don't take moderate or low bugs on ESR.

This was already marked "49+", because on security grounds it does. "sec-moderate" doesn't mean "we never take it on ESR", it means we judge it case-by-case. The download requirement lessens the mass-pwnage possibilities (thus not "high"), but the impact to affected individuals can still be severe.
Looks like it's too late for 49 (RC already shipped, this isn't a re-spin type fix) so I'll move the ESR to match "50+", but we do still want it on ESR just as we took [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") on ESR.

Yes, we have to draw a line somewhere for ESR. As Al said, sec-high and sec-moderate.

Well, I can't tell, because our severity ratings are all web-site-centric and don't really address the threat vector being a local file.
In this case, the attack would involve placing a specially crafted .desktop/.url file on the users disk, so maybe it's not that dangerous. I just can't tell. Do we consider a file on a network drive reading arbitrary files off your hard disk a sec-moderate or a sec-high?

We do take exceptions to this policy. The dev or someone else just makes a case for it normally. I didn't realize Dan had wanted it. Bumping the severity isn't really a solution as it messes up our rating system, which is not "make this more severe so we'll take it on ESR." The ratings have specific meanings (as much as possible).

Additionally, as Dan said in [comment #30](/show_bug.cgi?id=1292159#c30 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox V48.0 UXSS & Address Bar Spoofing"), we took [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") on ESR, which was also sec-moderate rated and involved a similar-ish problem. This bug is a direct regression from that bug, and so arguably as a regression that we uplifted to ESR, the fix for that regression should be uplifted as well, particularly because it is a security issue that, as noted in [comment #16](/show_bug.cgi?id=1292159#c16 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox V48.0 UXSS & Address Bar Spoofing"), is reasonably "obvious" given both the commit here and the previous fix which was already CVE'd and made public as fixed in earlier versions of ESR.

Be more careful about removing the inherit principal bit on base channel redirects
As we will ship 50 with the sec fix and several people think we should take it despite its severity, let's do it.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-44

## Local privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service

Announced

Seb Patane
Impact

### Description

Security researcher **Seb Patane** reported an issue with the
Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows. This issue allows unprivileged users to
local privilege escalation through the system privileges used by the service
when interacting with local malicious software. This allows the user to bypass
integrity checks leading to local privilege escalation. Local file system access
is necessary in order for this issue to be exploitable and it cannot be
triggered through web content.

I noticed the problem is known ([Bug 850492](/show_bug.cgi?id=850492 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution by Maintenance Service with junctions")) but wasn't fixed because the poc was not working. I have developed a poc which relies on the Volume Snapshot Service of windows to copy locked protected files. I tested the poc with the moz maintenance service at C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service and win7 64 bit.
If the Volume Snapshot Service is enabled and already a restore point was created (!) the poc is able to copy the C:\Windows\system32\config\SAM file and other protected files.

I'm attempting to fix this by having the service claim an exclusive lock on the copy of updater.exe while performing the copy and the validation steps, so that it's not possible for an outside process to read the file until after we've determined that it's a good updater.exe. Hopefully I'll have a patch ready to post here soon.

Well, that plan did not survive contact with reality. It turns out most of the validation process involves API's that attempt to open their own handles, so holding one with an exclusive lock keeps those from working, and it isn't exactly worth rewriting them all.
There's a second option, which is to still hold that lock while performing the copy, but then apply a tightly limited set of permissions to the copied file and then release the lock. This approach seems to work, in that I can no longer reproduce the bug with that fix in place, and tests are passing locally. So we'll go with that instead, unless a better idea comes along.

I'm checking out the patch but I have to say that setting restrictive permissions to try to fix these types of issues always scares me since it could possibly lock out part of the process.

Set tighter permissions on copies of updater.exe created by the maintenance service
So, copying the updater was added to prevent an exploit with the maintenance service when we were using the updater from the updates/0 directory. We no longer do that per [bug 1127481](/show_bug.cgi?id=1127481 "VERIFIED FIXED - Run updater.exe from the application directory when not using the service for an update"). It should be possible to not copy the file and run the updater from the install directory for the service as well to fix this.

At some point we should also remove the following removals for the /update directory as well but I'd like to wait a bit. Could you file a followup for this?

[Patch - Only copy updater.exe from install path, and verify it first](attachment.cgi?id=8769296&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8769296&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1247239&attachment=8769296)

Okay, here's a different way to deal with this. This patch has the service ignore the updater.exe path parameter and always use the one in the installation directory instead. Also, prior to making that copy, it performs the same verification steps that we run before actually running the updater; otherwise, it would still be possible to use this exploit to read an unrelated file that happens to be named updater.exe.
